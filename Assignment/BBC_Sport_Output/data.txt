Title: KS Bharat to play club cricket in England
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ks-bharat-to-play-club-cricket-in-england-9887022/
Content:
Discarded India wicketkeeper-batter KS Bharat has signed up for the London-based Dulwich Cricket Club for the 2025 Surrey Championship campaign.
The 31-year-old has played 7 Tests for India, including the World Test Championship final against Australia in 2023.
Bharat, who has played for the multiple IPL franchises, including Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Capitals was unsold in the mega auction.
Fresh off their promotion to the Premier Division, Dulwich will be looking to KS Bharat to make an immediate impact on the field.
Bharat has last played for India against England during the five-match Test series in 2024.
In 2015, KS Bharat caught the attention of the Indian cricket fraternity after becoming the first wicketkeeper-batsman to score a triple-century in the Ranji Trophy.
KS Bharat has played 105 first-class matches, and has scored 5686 runs including 10 centuries and 32 fifties.
Against Australia and in the World Test Championship final, Bharat’s batting didn’t look the part especially against pacers and even Nathan Lyon troubled him on a few occasions and he was later dropped. But Bharat went back to domestic cricket and worked on the batting aspect. And after working on his batting, Bharat comes to Hyderabad with scores of 64, 15, 116 not out for India ‘A’ against England Lions in Ahmedabad in 2024.
With Rishabh Pant back and Dhruv Jurel waiting in the wings, Bharat’s comeback to the Test is looking bleak. The pressure would definitely be on Bharat, a good outing with Dulwich followed by a solid Ranji Trophy could do him a world of good and bring him back in the mix. Beyond his performances, the club will benefit immensely from his priceless knowledge and experience, which will undoubtedly inspire players across the whole Club.

Title: Inside story: How and why Rohit Sharma got the extension to lead India in England
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/inside-story-how-and-why-rohit-sharma-got-the-extension-to-lead-india-in-england-9886970/
Content:
Not too long after India had scored the winning runs in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai, Rohit Sharma was assured that he would remain the Test captain for the June-August England tour. It is learnt that the sweaty T-shirts were still to dry and emotions of a second ICC Cup in a matter of months still to sink in, when Rohit got the all-important vote-of-confidence.
And thus ended Indian cricket’s latest leadership speculation that had peaked during the Border Gavaskar Trophy a month back. It also guaranteed a relatively peaceful IPL without the regular intrigue of the succession drama for those who consider Tests and ODIs to be on par with the franchise T20 cricket.
So when exactly did the decision-makers make up their mind over Rohit’s future as Indian captain? Was it when he was dancing down the track hitting the Kiwi bowlers out of the ground like Rohit of old and giving India the flying like he did during the last two ICC events? Or was it when he was being the white-ball Mike Brearley, shuffling his spinners, setting traps, strangling the opposition into submission?
Those in the know say it was the latter.
That’s because India have many opening batting options – Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Sanju Samson, and KL Rahul to name a few – but not one captaincy candidate who can match Rohit’s tactical acumen. He has the patience and nuance – a rare quality among modern-day cricketing leaders – to play the waiting game when chips are down in Tests.
In England, captains need to be persistent. They also need to be leaders with strong convictions, who can convince their players to keep pushing even during long fruitless periods.
Contrary to the general perception, England isn’t all about swing bowlers having a field day and wickets falling in heaps. It is also the place where batsmen stitch long partnerships after they have negotiated the early tricky spell when the ball is dancing around.
Daddy Hundreds is a phrase coined in England by their batting legend Graham Gooch. He was the father of Daddy Hundreds during his playing days. When he became England’s batting coach, his captain Alastair Cook took the baton and started running those run-marathons. Unfortunately, India has suffered at the hands of both.
There is also another English saying that gives an idea about the cricket narrative across counties. You wait ages for a bus, and then two or more come along at once. Wickets come in bunches – but only if captains are willing to be relentless in their pursuit. They can’t switch-off or let the game drift.
Even the best in business have failed this tough test. They gave up and paid the price. MS Dhoni, the much celebrated white-ball captain, had often looked clueless in Tests in England. Out of the 15 Tests he led in England, India lost 13.
During the 2011 series, where India lost all the four Tests, a team official confided that Dhoni would catch a nap when the team was batting. On the field too he would sleep-walk as the Test slipped from his hands. Ultra aggression and restlessness too doesn’t work in England. Under Kohli India lost 1-4 in 2018. A less firebrand approach, though, yielded a 2-1 lead under Kohli, but England squared the series by winning the postponed Test a year later (by then the captain was Rohit).
The last team to win in England, 2007, was under Rahul Dravid and little needs to be said about the tenacity of a cricketer called The Wall. That was the team that had the last of India’s Test titans – Tendulkar, Ganguly, Kumble, Laxman and Zaheer. Later day Indian teams did win in Australia but England remained unconquered for more than a decade and a half. Rohit too has a team that has Test pros – Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja and KL Rahul. He too can dig trenches, stay alert and keep chipping.
Like Dravid, Rohit too wears the worried expression on his face when he leads. He too comes across as a harried family patriarch, burdened by decision-making and the general well-being of his unit.
Rohit is a better man-manager than Dravid. And with England still carrying the trauma of the 2024 loss in India and presently confused about their Test-match approach – to Bazball or not? – India this summer can be expected to have an edge.
Bumrah is a highly viable captaincy option and the perfect skipper-in-waiting. By the sheer weight of his performance, he is an able captain, who leads by example. Bumrah is also a thinking player. He is a vociferous reader of a batsman’s mind – second-guessing their shots has become his second nature.
Bumrah’s time will come as Rohit has earned this extension. Rohit has spent more time on the field, dragging many teams out of holes. Six IPL victories, steamrolling of Baz-ballers and 2 ICC titles – you need these sparkling credentials to survive Test losses against New Zealand and Australia.
As compared to the Team India pressures, IPL will be a stroll for Rohit. At MI, the pressure will be on Hardik. After a forgettable 2024, it is him who needs to make a point.
Meanwhile, Rohit has re-discovered his touch. He is again coming inside the line and flicking the pacers over the square leg fence. He is also timing his foray down the pitch perfectly to smash them over mid-wicket. This is Rohit’s chance to be that carefree kid again, the prodigy in the Deccan Chargers shirt. It’s too fleeting a phase, a temporary luxury to not think about others around him. He needs to enjoy it as long as it lasts, as in England he will again have to be the harried family patriarch, burdened with decision-making and the general well-being of his army.

Title: Sam Billings wants to become England’s next white-ball captain
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sam-billings-wants-to-become-englands-next-white-ball-captain-9887000/
Content:
Sam Billings, who has not played for England since 2022, but he wants to become England’s next white-ball captain. Sam Billings had led Oval Invincibles to win The Hundred in the past two seasons and won the ILT20 in the UAE with Dubai Capitals in February.
“I’d be honoured, you would obviously jump at an opportunity like that. I feel like I can add value,” Sam Billings told BBC Sport.
“I’ve not had a conversation with anyone, but from a leadership point of view I’ve loved the time over the past few years where I’ve had some really good success.”
Billings has played three Tests, 28 one-day internationals and 37 T20s for England.
“The talent in domestic cricket in this country is always there, certainly in white-ball cricket,” said Billings.
“You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It will just be a tweak here or there, picking a really nice, balanced side.
“It should provide great opportunity for all of us in England. If you’re going to stick your hand up and perform well, there are opportunities up for grabs, or there should be, in those formats. As a player, I’m looking at that thinking ‘why not, let’s try to get back in that side’.”
Ben Stokes is tipped as England’s next captain in the ODIs with Harry Brook leading the T20Is.
“I can’t speak highly enough of Ben Stokes,” added Billings. “There’s no better man in terms of captaincy and as an all-round cricketer.
“But his priority is the Ashes and the five-Test series against India.”
“He is probably in the position where he can answer where his body can take him. Harry Brook is another one who fits similar criteria. You’ve got to balance it out. Playing all formats for England has never been tougher.”

Title: Post-Champions Trophy win, Rohit Sharma likely to remain captain for England Test series

Following India’s overwhelming Champions Trophy triumph, Rohit Sharma is likely to remain captain for the June-August five-Test series in England, The Indian Express has learnt.
After struggling for runs during the home Test summer, followed by a disastrous tour to Australia which prompted him to “stand down” from the final Test in Sydney, there was speculation that the national selectors may take a call on his future in red-ball cricket. However, the victory in Dubai may prolong Rohit’s Test career.
The Indian Express has learnt that Rohit has got the backing of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and its selection panel to lead the team on another major tour.
“He has shown what he can do. Every stakeholder feels that he is the right candidate to lead the Indian side for the tour of England. Rohit too has expressed his eagerness to keep playing red-ball cricket,” said a source.
Soon after winning the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand on Sunday, Rohit had himself quashed rumours of immediate retirement, without spelling out his long-term plans. He was asked about the next 50-overs World Cup that India is to host in 2027.
“Right now, I’m playing really well, and I’m enjoying everything I’m doing with this team, and the team is enjoying my company as well, which is nice. I can’t really say 2027, because it’s too far, but I’m keeping all my options open,” he had told the International Cricket Council (ICC).
“It’s something that really makes me happy. There are a lot of things involved, there’s so much pride, and the way this team is playing, I don’t want to leave this team. The way we are playing at this point in time, there is so much joy, so much fun to play with all of them,” he had said.
In January, after standing down from the Sydney Test, Rohit had said that his bad patch would not continue forever. His highest score in the three Tests he played Down Under was 10 and his last Test 50 was in October 2024, during the home series against New Zealand.
“There is no guarantee that runs won’t come five or two months down the line. I have seen a lot of cricket. Life changes every second, every minute, every day. I have confidence in myself that things can change, but at the same time I have to be realistic as well,” he had told Star Sports.

Title: WPL Final: Refreshed Delhi Capitals or on-song Mumbai Indians? Lead-up to title clash adds to intrigue
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-final-refreshed-delhi-capitals-or-on-song-mumbai-indians-9886842/
Content:
In the history of international cricket, no other captain has achieved the success that Meg Lanning had. She led Australia to five World Cup titles – four T20s and one in ODIs. However, in the Women’s Premier League, Lanning – still hugely successful in leading Delhi Capitals for three seasons – has fallen just short of lifting the trophy two years in a row.
On Saturday, she’ll have a chance to end that run and lift the trophy when Delhi Capitals take on Mumbai Indians in the WPL 2025 final at Brabourne Stadium. For Harmanpreet Kaur, it will be another chance to get a win over a Lanning-led side – something she did in the first edition at this very venue but couldn’t quite do so consistently as India’s captain.
The lead-up to the final has made for a fascinating contrast. DC played their last league match on March 7 in Lucknow. Their previous match was on March 1 in Bengaluru. In the hectic world of a franchise cricket league, playing 2 matches in the space of 14 days is not very common. Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, have played more matches this week than DC have this month: they had matches on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and are playing the final on Saturday. It is bound to be exhausting but they’d be aware of the conditions much better than DC. In their case, familiarity might not necessarily breed contempt.
Both captains expectedly put a favourable spin on it. “I see it in a positive way,” Harmanpreet said. “We know what area to bowl, how to bat, and how to execute (our skills) in a better way, which overs to take care of without losing too many wickets.
“We have got lots of energy within the group,” Lanning said, almost using the exact words that vice-captain Jemimah Rodrigues had done in a media interaction a day earlier, indicating clearly it’s something that has been discussed internally. “We have trained out here as well and a lot of players have played here before so that is certainly not an issue for us. We had a busy period earlier in the tournament. So, it’s been nice to be able to refresh ourselves.”
- Most consistent team in WPL across 3 seasons, led by an inspirational captain
- Best opening pair in WPL history in Shafali-Lanning, and all-round bowling attack

- Home advantage, and familiarity with conditions, having already played thrice this week at Brabourne
- World-class overseas allrounders in Matthews and Sciver-Brunt; with Harmanpreet also in good form

Of course, the final will come down to the actual execution of cricketing skills, that much both the captains agreed upon. Winning the toss and chasing had been the success mantra in the first three legs of the tournament, but that has changed in Mumbai too as teams have managed to post winning totals after being asked to bat first. That somewhat takes the toss out of the equation and makes it a bit more even.
Both teams possess outright match-winners with the bat. No batting pair in the history of WPL has been more prolific than Lanning and Shafali Verma, and they’ll hold the key once more. The Indian opener, who has almost certainly done enough to be back in the national scheme of things after being dropped, has been in solid form. If the two can provide the start they are capable of, DC’s chances shoot up. In the past two finals, it’s the batting that let them down primarily.
MI are blessed with three of the best all-rounders in the women’s game right now and two of them have been in stellar form. Hayley Matthews and Nat Sciver-Brunt (playing the best tournament of her career even by her high standards) put Gujarat Giants to the sword in the Eliminator. And with Harmanpreet striking the ball well too, their main batters are in prime form. Both teams, however, will have concerns about the middle order, and that’s where the match could be decided, given the bowling units are also fairly well-matched.
Lanning wouldn’t leave much to chance but DC would be hoping it is third-time lucky for them in this league’s brief history.

Title: Watch how cricketers spent Holi: Sachin Tendulkar ambushes Yuvraj Singh; Rahul Dravid gets smeared in gulal

Just like the rest of the country, Indian cricketers too played Holi with great pomp. In Raipur, Little Master Sachin Tendulkar led from the front and ensured that Yuvraj Singh, his teammate for the Indian team at the International Masters League (IML), was drenched well after leading a gang of pranksters to Yuvraj’s hotel room.
Tendulkar ambushed Yuvraj, who seemed to be sleeping late on Holi, in his room with a water gun. Tendulkar was joined by his International Masters League teammates like Yusuf Pathan and Rahul Sharma.
“This water gun is loaded and we’re headed to Yuvraj’s room. He’s sleeping right now after hitting way too many sixes the last night (in the semi-finals against Australia at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket Stadium, New Raipur),” Tendulkar says in a video he posted on social media before marching with teammates to Yuvraj’s room where they pretend to be from housekeeping to get Yuvraj to open the door before attacking him.

Meanwhile, Tendulkar’s one-time Indian cricket team mate, Rahul Dravid was also a part of the Holi celebrations for his Indian Premier League team Rajasthan Royals.
Dravid is currently nursing a serious injury on his foot and has been wearing a cast on his left foot. A video from  Rajasthan Royals showed the Royals celebrating with pink gulal and some of the players, led by Yashasvi Jaiswal, approaching Dravid to politely apply gulal on the face of the Indian cricket legend.

Title: ‘The IPL has brought out a winning mentality in all our players,’ says RCB batting coach and mentor Dinesh Karthik

Content:
India broke the 13-year trophy drought when they won the 2024 T20 World Cup co-hosted by West Indies and the United States and they also managed to bag another ICC title in the form of Champions Trophy 2025 earlier. Former Indian cricketer Dinesh Karthik credits the Indian Premier League for the rise in Indian cricket.
“The IPL has brought out a winning mentality in all our players. With the influx of money and the financial benefits that a lot of the teams receive, and in turn the stakeholders, a lot of it has been put back in infrastructure. So, when infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops as well,” RCB batting coach and mentor said as quoted by an RCB press release.
“We can say that since the IPL has become a part of Indian cricket’s fabric, they can now field two to three teams in international cricket at the same time, and almost compete with each one of them. Right now, India is in a very privileged place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets,” Karthik added.
Karthik would also share his own experience when he was a player at the Delhi Capitals and Glenn McGrath was part of the setup. “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year, I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him, I got to know him better and became comfortable, which helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” Karthik said.

Title: After the 2021 World Cup, I received threat calls… was returning from the airport, a couple of people followed me: Varun Chakarvarthy

Content:
Varun Chakarvarthy who played a pivotal role with the ball in the recently concluded Champions Trophy 2025 has had his fair share of issues in the past. When he debuted for India in 2021 in the T20 World Cup in Dubai he did not have the same success at the time and India was knocked out without qualifying for the semifinal.
“After the 2021 World Cup, I received threat calls. ‘Don’t come to India. If you try, you won’t be able to.’People came up to my house, and tracked me down – I had to hide at times. When I was returning from the airport, a couple of people followed me on their bikes. It happens. I can understand fans are emotional,” Chakarvarthy said speaking on a Youtube channel with anchor Gobinath.
“But when I look back at those things and the praise I am receiving now, I am happy. I am not able to believe that all good things are happening in one go. I want to take it to the next level. I have faced setbacks, and I know how bad the criticism can be,” he added.
Chakarvarthy picked up nine wickets in the Champions Trophy 2025 including a five-wicket haul against New Zealand during the group phase of the tournament. “I think the Champions Trophy was a huge confidence booster because I played only four matches. And when I performed well in those matches, I felt I belonged and that there was a place for me. But I didn’t expect this success,” Chakarvarthy said.
“After playing the T20I series finale in Mumbai, I was preparing to return to Chennai. I even got the tickets for Chennai. But the next morning, I was told that I was in the one-day team too and was asked to come to Nagpur. I didn’t expect it. I didn’t take any clothes or anything for that. I asked my family to send me stuff to Nagpur,” he added.

Title: Hosting rights: How AFL prevailed over Cricket Australia’s plans to host Sheffield Shield final at Adelaide Oval
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/hosting-rights-afl-cricket-australia-sheffield-shield-final-adelaide-9886697/
Content:
In yet another clash between two sporting federations over hosting games at a venue in Australia, Australian Football League (AFL) surpassed Cricket Australia’s ploy to host the Sheffield Shield final at the Adelaide Oval. With South Australia having qualified for the Shield final scheduled to be played from March 26 to March 30, Cricket Australia has now confirmed the shifting of the match to the Karen Rolton Oval.
“We are disappointed South Australia has been prevented from hosting the Sheffield Shield final at Adelaide Oval. The Sheffield Shield final is a significant event for Australia’s national sport, and we believe Adelaide Oval would have been the most appropriate venue,” CA chief executive Todd Greenberg said in a statement on Friday.
While South Australia are placed currently at the top of the points table with 51 points with one round to go, the team is eying its first Shield title since 1996. With South Australian government legislation rules giving South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) unrestricted access to cricket activities from October 8 to March 14 every year, the legislation also provides the window for South Australian National Football League and AFL stadium hosting rights from March 15 to October 7 at the multi-sport venue. According to the AFL calendar, Port Adelaide play against Fremantle at Adelaide Oval on March 22 with another match between Adelaide Crows and North Melbourne to be played at the Adelaide Oval on March 30.
With CA pushing for the Sheffield Shield final to be played from March 24 to March 28 at Adelaide Oval, there were talks about drop-in pitches to be re-installed at Adelaide Oval for the Shield final before handing over the stadium to AFL. “I would like to thank Premier Malinauskas for his advocacy in this matter and his passionate support of cricket and the South Australia Cricket Association which made an extremely compelling case to host the final at Adelaide Oval. March is a very important month for cricket including the Sheffield Shield and Premier and club cricket finals. We will continue to work collaboratively at all levels to ensure cricket gains and provides appropriate access to shared venues across the country,” Greenberg further stated.
According to Australian media, AFL’s concerns over the cutting of grass on the out-field for the Shield final was one of the reasons for players’ safety during the March 30 AFL match. According to The Advertiser, AFL wanted compensation if a player was injured if the change-over happened. South Australia Premier Peter Malinauskas had last week supported the plan to host the Shield final to be played at Adelaide Oval and it would have meant that the Shield final should have been played for the first time at a Test venue in 13 years. Malinauskas also revealed the compensation request from AFL.
“We have received a request, it’s not from cricket, I won’t say what entity it is in footy. What I would say is we are asking for people to act rationally and pragmatically in the interest of fans. The South Australian government has already shown an awful lot of support to both footy clubs locally, particular the Adelaide footy club.  I’ve got to say it’s a little bit galling that people are trying to use an opportunity to look after fans as an opportunity to slug the taxpayer and I won’t be having it.  Just handing over cash is not something that I’ll be doing. I hope this doesn’t get in the way of it.  I’m not naming any names, I’m just saying my government is not going to be giving cash so they get out of the way of something everybody thinks should happen.” Malinauskas told 5AA earlier this week
Earlier, AFL chief executive Andrew Dillon had shared that the league would look into the request “Like we do with other sports where we have a scheduling clash, we’re fortunate to play in the best stadiums in Australia across all of our capital cities and we know those stadiums get built and operate because they are multi-sport,” Dillon had told Australian Media last week.
South Australia skipper Nathan McSweeney talked about the final venue on Friday. “Adelaide Oval is one of the best grounds in the world in my opinion, but Karen Rolton is an awesome venue as well and we now get a great look at what it’s going to be like next week,” McSweeney told cricket.com.au. .

Title: ‘I’ve bowled millions of balls during my career and there was no doubt whatsoever’: Australian spinner Matthew Kuhnemann on suspected bowling action
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ive-bowled-millions-of-balls-during-my-career-and-there-was-no-doubt-whatsoever-australian-spinner-matthew-kuhnemann-on-suspected-bowling-action-9886574/
Content:
Weeks after his action was cleared of suspected illegal bowling action by the ICC, Australian left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has shared how he was always confident about him getting the nod post the tests and had no doubt about the result of the tests. The 28-year-old was the leading wicket-taker with 16 wickets during Australia’s tour to Sri Lanka early this year before his action was reported by match officials.
“I’ve played over 100 professional games and never got questioned, so that’s why I was always confident that I’d be fine. Before the incident and after, I’ve never been more confident in my ability as a cricketer than I am at the moment. The process was very straightforward and simple – you pretty much bowl. You go in there and bowl 20-30 balls (surrounded by) lots of cameras and sensors … so I was happy to get it done as soon as possible and get on with the season. I was very confident the whole time. I’ve bowled millions of balls during my career and there was no doubt whatsoever,” Kuhnemann told Cricket Australia’s website.
The left-arm spinner underwent an assessment at National Cricket Centre in Brisbane and the results of the assessment tests came last month clearing the left-arm spinner’s action. Though he could not play international cricket till the results of the tests came, the left-arm spinner was eligible to play on Austra;ia’s domestic circuit. The 28-year-old missed Tasmania’s Sheffield Shield match against South Australia last month. He then played for Tasmania against Queensland post the results of the tests and will now be playing in Tasmania’s final game of the season against New South Wales starting Saturday.
“It’s pretty rare to get a break in the middle of the season. I gave a chance for my body to recover; I bowled a fair few overs in Sri Lanka and prior to that Test series, so it was like a mini pre-season in the middle of the season, so it was quite nice to have a couple weeks off. I was very grateful for the support Cricket Australia and Cricket Tasmania provided me through that time. If it wasn’t for (the move to) Tassie, I probably wouldn’t have made my way over to Sri Lanka so I’m very fortunate for … the opportunity. We would have liked to win a few more games this season and to be in that Shield final, but we’re definitely growing something good down here and are not far off from holding the Shield,” said the left-arm spinner.
While Nathan Lyon is expected to don the leading spinner’s role for Australia in the World Test Championship final against South Africa in June, Matthew Kuhnemann can make a return to the Australian Test team for the West Indies tour. “I’ve personally never been to the West Indies, but I’ve heard it has taken some spin in the last few years, so if the opportunity comes, I’d love to go over there and play a role in that squad. After this Shield game I’ll sit down and work out what my next 3-4 months look like; I’d love to keep playing cricket, I loved my time in Durham (in 2023). So if the opportunity rises, I’d take it with both hands,” concluded Kuhnemann.

Title: Indian players don’t go to play in other leagues…all the boards should stop sending their players to the IPL: Inzamam-ul-Haq

Indian Premier League is arguably the best franchise league in the world. Players from different cricketing nations play for different franchises in the league. However, while other players can come and take part in the competition Indian players are not allowed to play in other franchise leagues.
Though the likes of Dinesh Karthik, Yuvraj Singh, and Irfan Pathan did play in other franchise leagues based in Canada, South Africa, and Sri Lanka they did it after their retirement for India.
“Keep the Champions Trophy aside, you look at the IPL where all the top players from around the world take part. But Indian players don’t go to play in other leagues. Hence, all the boards should stop sending their players to the IPL. If you don’t release your players for any league, then shouldn’t other boards take a stance?” Inzamam-ul-Haq would say in a local news channel.

In the recently concluded Champions Trophy 2025 though the tournament was hosted in Pakistan, since India refused to travel to Pakistan due to political stance, all the games of The Men in Blue had to be held in Dubai and ironically Pakistan themselves who are official hosts of the tournament had to travel to UAE to face India and the final too was hosted in Dubai because of India’s progress in the tournament.
In addition to the non-allowance of Indian players to play in abroad, the IPL has also banned Pakistan players from participating in the league after the inaugural season.
Imad Wasim, Hassan Ali, Saud Shakeel, Salman Ali Agha, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir were among the 45 Pakistan cricketers who enlisted their names for the draft of The Hundred and were snubbed by all the eight franchises on Wednesday. Five female Pakistan cricketers also found no takers in the women’s draft on Wednesday.
The Hundred’s draft saw 270 domestic and 350 overseas cricketers throw their hats in the ring to be picked for the upcoming season, which starts on August 5. It must be noted that the eight teams are still able to add two more players to their squads in May’s wildcard draft.

Title: ‘If they want to boo me, boo me, but…’: Aussie star David Warner’s appeal to fans ahead of the Hundred
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/david-warner-the-hundred-lords-boo-london-spirit-9886625/
Content:
Having been picked up as Hundred side London Spirit’s second draft pick early this week, former Australian cricketer David Warner will be making the Lord’s his home ground for England Cricket Board’s marquee event. Having faced the ire of the England fans during his international career, including a face-off against MCC members in the long room during the second Ashes Test in 2023, Warner has appealed to the English fans to not boo London Spirit but him if they want to. Warner was earlier picked up by Southern Brave in the tournament in its inaugural edition in 2021 before he pulled out due to international commitments and this will be the first time that the Australian will be playing in the Hundred.
“We just have to wait until I step foot on that park first won’t we?. I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I’m really looking forward to it. I know how the English crowds are and that excites me as well, whether they’re supporting me, the team or whoever it is. I just love being over there, playing in front of the crowd. I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff. That’s what gets me going. But I want them to support London Spirit. If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team or anything like that. Keep cheering for us,” Warner told the media on Thursday.
The 38-year-old had retired from international cricket last year post the T20 World Cup. Warner has been part of the Fox Cricket commentary team and will be present for commentary in The Ashes later this year. The former opener shared his views about England’s approach and opined that he is not convinced about the ‘Bazball’ approach working in Australia.
“I don’t know if Bazball is a myth now over there (in England), but I can’t see it happening in Australia with the bounce and everything and the fields. It would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia. Given that you want to wear the wickets out a little bit, get into day four, day five, it’s probably not the way to go about it. But if that is the way they go about it, it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end I think,” said Warner.
England last won the Ashes in 2015 with Australia retaining the urn since then. Since 1986-87, England have won the Ashes only once in Australia and Warner has counted Australia as his pick to win the Ashes this year. “At the moment, just with the Australians (as favourites). Not just knowing the conditions but you’ve got over 1,400 international, or Test wickets in that lineup with the Australian cricket team. They’re world class bowlers, they’re always going to turn out and that’s the biggest hurdle for England,” said Warner.

Title: ‘Mohammed Shami is a world class player for a reason’: Australian young talent Connolly on Indian pacer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammed-shami-is-a-world-class-player-for-a-reason-australian-young-talent-connolly-on-indian-pacer-9886589/

In what was World champions Australia’s first defeat in the knock-out stages in ICC Tournaments since the 2011 World Cup, opener Cooper Connolly remained in spotlight first with a nine-ball duck and later dropping a Rohit Sharma catch followed by his wicket later during the team’s six-wicket loss against eventual champions India in the Champion Trophy semi-final in Dubai early this week. The 21-year-old had faced nine deliveries from Indian pacer Mohammed Shami before he edged behind for a nine-ball duck and the rookie, who was called in as replacement for Matthew Short in the semi-final, has termed Shami as a world class bowler.
“As a kid, you always want to represent your country, and to walk out there in a semi-final was an unbelievable experience, and I’ll take a lot of learnings from it. Mohammad Shami is a world class player for a reason. He’s played a lot of cricket. In the end, it was a great game of cricket and I think we took a lot of learnings as a group from that,” Connolly told reporters ahead of Western Australia’s Sheffield Shield match against Victoria.
The 21-year-old, who had played a knock of 90 runs in last year’s Sheffield Shield final, had made his ODI debut against England last year. The Western Australian had then made his Test debut during the Sri Lanka tour early this year. Connolly, who also bowls left-arm spin, was preferred upon opener Jake Fraser-Mcgurkfor the Champions Trophy semi-final clash against India. While he failed to make a mark during Australia’s batting, he dropped Rohit Sharma in the second over during India’s run chase before he picked up the wicket of Sharma in his first over in the innings. “It’s the game of cricket. You’re going to miss out, you’re going to drop a catch – you’ve got to get on with what’s in front of you. That (drop off Rohit) was completely out of my mind by the time I was bowling, I was just trying to compete as much as I could and hopefully get a breakthrough for the team,” Connolly added.
The youngster, who has played in five First Class matches and 27 T20s in his career, also talked about his dream to play in IPL too. “Getting my Baggy Green and then to play a game in the Champions Trophy, it was a dream come true … hopefully there’s plenty more to come. The dream would be to play the IPL eventually… (But) I’m just concentrating on what’s in front of me. Not looking too far ahead, just trying to enjoy playing cricket and hopefully put some scores on the board while working on my bowling,” said Connolly.

Title: ‘He’s an incredible bowler’: Nathan McSweeney opens up about facing Jasprit Bumrah’s ‘chaos’ in BGT
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/nathan-mcsweeney-jasprit-bumrah-chaos-ind-vs-aus-bgt-9886513/
Content:
Australian batter Nathan McSweeney recently opened up about facing Jasprit Bumrah in the Border Gavaskar Trophy, saying that it was “chaos” facing the Indian bowler. He also said that before facing Bumrah, he didn’t think it would be a big deal but found out the hard way what the Indian pacer brings to the table.
“Yeah, tough work is probably an understatement. He’s an incredible bowler. I was probably naïve going into it, never faced him before and (thinking) he’ll be fine. But he’s an incredible bowler that has a great skill but just relentless ability to pitch the ball in the area where you don’t want as a batter,” McSweeney said.
“So, it was a very tough challenge but also gave me a hope that no one kind of had great success against him and everyone was trying to tackle him at the same time and no one was playing him with ease, which gave me a little bit of confidence,” he added.

A post shared by Willow Talk (@willowtalkpodcast)
McSweeney, originally a middle-order batsman, was included in the Test squad after Australia were unable to zero-in on a reliable partner to Usman Khawaja. In the six inning he batted, McSweeney had scores of: 10,0, 39, 10*, 9 & 4 as Bumrah repeatedly tested Australia’s batting line-up.
The Australian had a tough time against Bumrah in the series scoring just 72 runs in 3 matches and getting sent back by the Indian pacer 4 times out of 5. He would then be dropped from the Australian side for the last 2 Test matches.

Meanwhile, Bumrah was the Player of the Series against Australia in the BGT, bagging 32 wickets across five Tests. However, he sustained a back injury in the series and could not bowl in the second innings of the 5th and final test.

Title: Stuart Broad says England should not make Ben Stokes ODI captain – ‘Would be lost for words’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/stuart-broad-england-odi-captaincy-ben-stokes-9886462/
Content:
While England are in search of a new ODI captain, former seamer Stuart Broad has cautioned against taking a backward step in appointing Test skipper Ben Stokes as leader of the 50-over side.
After England’s harrowing league-stage Champions Trophy exit and Jos Buttler’s resignation from captaincy, ECB managing director Rob Key had suggested Stokes among the potential candidates for the ODI captaincy. “Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I’ve ever seen. So it would be stupid not to look at him. It’s just the knock-on effect of what that means,” Key told reporters last week. “I think nothing’s off the table really. You look at every single option and you think, right, what is the best thing to do? How is that going to impact on other things?
While Stokes had previously hinted at returning for the Champions Trophy, a hamstring tear during last year’s New Zealand tour doused the plans. Stokes has not featured in a 50-over match since the 2023 ODI World Cup, a tournament for which he had returned from retirement.
As Stokes’ name is making the rounds for a potential ODI leadership role, his former teammate Broad cautioned against the move.
“Going for Stokes would be a move of desperation. I would be lost for words if England appointed him,” Broad told Daily Mail.
“Firstly, there is the schedule. He’s not going to the Indian Premier League to try to prioritise the Test match team and get his physicality right for the big events on the horizon. How many overs has Stokes bowled successfully in the last three years while battling his knee injuries? Not many.
“And you’re going to add another eight to 10 overs in a 50-over format onto his workload? The mathematics of that make no sense. As someone who played 121 one-day internationals I can honestly say I found the 50-over format more tiring than Test match cricket. Why? Because it’s such high intensity.
“You bowl 10 overs in three and a half hours, during which you are running from fielding positions, sprinting after balls all the time, non stop. Ben Stokes is the best captain we’ve got, but it doesn’t mean he’s the right person to do the 50-over job,” Broad remarked.
Stokes will have a busy year ahead of him on the Test front with two heavyweight five-match Test series loaded against India at home and the Ashes in Australia later this year. England will next play a three-match ODI series against West Indies at the end of May.

Title: ‘He’s unique in the way he bats and scores runs’: Denesh Ramdin heaps praise on Rishabh Pant
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/denesh-ramdin-on-rishabh-pant-unique-batting-style-9886432/
Content:
Former West Indies skipper Denesh Ramdin lauded India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant and called him unique due to his flamboyant batting style. “Obviously, Rishabh Pant is one—he’s unique in the way he bats and scores runs. There’s a young guy from Australia, Josh Inglis—he did well in the Champions Trophy. There are many young keepers coming through,” Ramdin said.
The 40-year-old also said that over the years, the role of the wicketkeepers have evolved since Adam Gilchrist came into prominence.
“Back in the day, wicketkeepers were primarily just keepers, but now cricket has evolved. The role of the keeper-batsman has expanded, starting with players like Adam Gilchrist, who opened the batting and excelled. Others like Quinton de Kock, Brendon McCullum, and of course, the exceptional Mahendra Singh Dhoni, have been fantastic in shaping the modern wicketkeeper’s role.”
Ramdin also shared his thoughts on how Sunil Narine might perform in the upcoming IPL season.
“Obviously, Narine was the MVP last year, and his team won the championship. He’ll have a lot of confidence going into the new season, but every season brings a new atmosphere and new challenges, with different players in the team. I have no doubt that Sunil, though a man of few words, expresses himself fully through his performances with both the ball and the bat,” he said.
Pant, who was in the India side which won the Champions Trophy recently but did not get a match, will next be seen in action leading the Lucknow Super Giants in the upcoming Indian Premier League season. Pant was bagged by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crores after a ferocious bidding war at the IPL auction.

While his former franchise Delhi Capitals opted for an Right To Match bid at Rs 20.75 crore, LSG raised the bidding by a staggering margin to Rs 27 crore, make him the most expensive signing at the auctions history ahead of Shreyas Iyer, who received a Rs 26.75 crore bid from Punjab Kings.

Title: ‘We have had one of the best IPL cycles in the last three seasons’: Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sanju-samson-captain-rajasthan-royals-ipl-best-cycles-9886254/
Content:
Rajasthan Royals skipper Sanju Samson recently discussed in length about captaining the franchise, spilling the details on the last three Indian Premier League cycles with RR finishing 3rd last season, 5th in 2023 and second in 2022. In an interaction with JioHotstar, Samson talks in details about how despite having to let go of players who have been an integral part of the team in the past, RR hacve managed to rope in some interesting new players in their place.
“We’ve had one of the best IPL cycles in the last three seasons, with the highest winning percentage and some of the best players Rajasthan Royals has ever had. We had all the superstars from around the world, and it felt like a family. But then, as per IPL rules, you have to let go of that family and build a new one again. So that’s where we are now. We’ve brought in some interesting players, from a 13-year-old to a 35-year-old, creating a mix of youth and experience in the squad,” Samson said.
“Personally, I’m very excited about this challenge—meeting new people, building relationships, and understanding the personalities behind the performances. That’s where the real fun lies. The work begins long before the IPL, during the 7-10 days of preparation. I try to spend as much time as possible outside my room, talking to my players and coaches, building that camaraderie. And then, we embark on the journey together as a unit. That’s where the joy of being a captain comes in,” he added.
In the IPL auction last year, Rajasthan managed to secure Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga while also adding the likes of Akash Madhwal and Kumar Kartikeya Singh into their ranks. They also brought in 13-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi who scored 104 off 62 balls in India Under-19’s Youth Test against Australia in Chennai last year.

He also became the youngest player to be signed in IPL history as he ignited a bidding war between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals, with the former ultimately securing him for a handsome sum of Rs 1.1 crore.

Title: ‘Can you play for my team?’: Sanju Samson opens up about his start in Rajasthan Royals under captain Rahul Dravid

Rajasthan Royals captain Sanju Samson opened up about the time he got his start for the franchise under the captain Rahul Dravid back in 2013. Now, in 2025, Sanju is leading the Royals while Dravid has returned at the helm as the coach of the franchise.
“It’s quite funny how things work out. In my first season, Rahul sir was the one who spotted me during the trials. He was the captain back then, looking out for young talent. After watching me, he came up to me and said, ‘Okay, can you play for my team?’ From that day to today, it feels surreal. Now, I am the captain of the franchise, and Rahul sir has returned after so many years to coach the team,” Samson said in an interaction with JioHotstar.
“It’s a unique and special feeling. He was always part of the Rajasthan Royals family, and we are all grateful to have him back. I have played under him both at Rajasthan Royals and in the Indian team when he was the coach. But now, having him as a coach while I captain the side is something truly special. I am looking forward to learning a lot from him in the coming years, and it’s really exciting,” he added.
Last year, Rajasthan Royals had announced that Rahul Dravid will be joining the franchise as a head coach after signing a multi-year contract.
Dravid’s tenure as India’s head coach ended in June after he helped the Men in Blue win the T20 World Cup, their first ICC title since the Champions trophy in 2013.
Dravid was the captain of the Royals in IPL 2012 and 2013 and then was the team director and mentor for them in the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

Meanwhile, the Royals, led by Sanju will open their IPL 2025 campaign in an away fixture against last year’s runners up Sunrisers Hyderabad on March 23.

Title: Mark Wood undergoes knee surgery, set to miss entirety of India Test series
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mark-wood-knee-surgery-ruled-out-cricket-to-miss-india-test-series-9886137/
Content:
England speedster Mark Wood will miss England’s Test series against India later this year after undergoing surgery on his left knee.
On Thursday, the England Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that Wood had been ruled out of all cricket for four months after scans and subsequent surgery this week, which confirmed ligament damage to his left knee.
According to ECB, Wood was managing an ongoing issue with his knee for over a year. The Durham pacer left the field due to an injury during the side’s ICC Champions Trophy Group B match against Afghanistan in Lahore earlier this month, forcing him to leave the field after completing his spell.
Wood is expected to be fully fit by July 2025 and will now work closely with the ECB medical team on his rehabilitation and recovery.
India’s tour of England will start in late June and the five-match Test series will finish by the first week of August following which the England team will take a break from the red ball cricket until the highly-anticipated 2025-26 Ashes.
“I’m gutted to be out for so long after representing England across all formats since the start of last year,” said Wood. “But I’ve got every confidence that I’ll be back firing on all cylinders now that I’ve been able to sort my knee out.
“I want to thank the surgeon, the doctors, staff, my England teammates and coaches for their support – and, of course, our fans. I can’t wait to get back and contribute to what is going to be a huge 2025 for us as a team.”

Content:
Axar Patel on Friday has named Delhi Capitals captain ahead of the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), the franchise said in a statement. Axar Patel has been with the Delhi Capitals since 2019 and was retained for Rs 16.50 crore.

Title: Ricky Ponting credits Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya for India’s Champions Trophy triumph
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ricky-ponting-credits-ravindra-jadeja-axar-patel-hardik-pandya-for-indias-champions-trophy-triumph-9886049/
Content:
Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has lauded India’s all-rounders trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Hardik Patel for their “outstanding” performance throughout the 2025 Champions Trophy, which was eventually won by the Rohit Sharma-led team.
“Their all-rounders right through the tournament were outstanding,” Ponting said on the latest edition of The ICC Review.
“(Ravindra) Jadeja, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, were all outstanding. I said at the start of the tournament I thought India would be really hard to beat because of their overall balance and because of that mix of youth and experience, and once again, in a final, the captain stands up and gets the job done for his team.”
Ponting explained that how having three all-rounders in the playing XI has helped India an incredible batting depth.
“They were a very well balanced side anyway, but because they had so many all-rounders…when you’ve got Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, who they used up the order on a number of occasions for that left-handed option, and with Jadeja there as well, they were a very well balanced team.
“The only thing you would probably say, they probably looked a little bit light on fast bowling, but as it turned out, they didn’t need that.
“That’s where Hardik Pandya’s role becomes really important to be able to bowl with a new ball and get through some overs early to make it a little bit easier for the spinners in the backend of their Powerplay and also through the middle overs where they predominantly bowl and spin pretty much right through the middle of the game.”
Ponting showered praise on Axar Patel, with whom he has worked in Delhi Capitals and has played a massive turnaround in his batting.
In the past few years, Patel has worked on his hitting game, especially at Delhi Capitals, under the watchful eyes of head coach Ricky Ponting. A realignment of his front foot while lofting down the ground, holding his hitting shape and developing scoring areas square of the wicket – have all contributed in expanding his stroke options.
“Axar Patel is the other one that I think needs a lot of credit for this tournament. I think his bowling was as consistent and rock solid as you’d ever see,” Ponting added.
“Then, just some of those little cameos he played with the bat, coming in earlier and sort of steadying the ship and just making life a little bit easier for the lower order in KL Rahul, Pandya, and Jadeja…I think he deserves a lot of credit for his tournament.”

Title: An All England fairy tale: From part-time gigs to now retiring on a high to be full-time YouTube content creators
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/all-england-fairytale-part-time-gigs-retiring-youtube-content-creators-9886739/
Content:
Fairy tales, by definition, are associated with happy endings. In sporting parlance, does it have to mean a winning end? Not if you are Gregory Mairs and Jenny Mairs. The English husband-wife duo, ranked 44 in the world, came into the All England Open with no major expectations. They, after all, had never won a match in the main draw of their home tournament in six previous attempts.
Days before the 2025 edition, they had announced that this would be the last tournament of their professional careers. By the time they were done – losing in the quarterfinals on Friday – they didn’t just register their first-ever wins in Birmingham, they had dumped out two higher-ranked pairs and were the last-standing English contenders.
As their careers wound down with plenty of smiles and applause from the Utilita Arena crowd who brought the roof down for them, Greg threw his racket into the crowd and it was fittingly caught by a person wearing “Badminton Insight” T-shirt, next to a big banner with the same words. That is the name of Greg and Jenny’s YouTube channel which, at the time of writing, has 589K subscribers and more than 83 million views for their 220+ videos so far.
“As we were walking out of the arena we heard people shout: “Smash that subscribe button”, something which we say at the end of our videos,” Jenny had said on Wednesday. “We had a pizza restaurant booked (on the night of their first-round match) to celebrate our careers with our family,” Greg had said after they beat world No 12 Japan’s Hiroki Midorikawa and Natsu Saido in the round of 32. “It might have to be pasta instead.”
Admittedly, they played the best badminton of their careers in the last event as they went on to beat Ruttanapak Oupthong and Jhenicha Sudjaipraparat of Thailand to reach the quarterfinals as well, before eventually bowing out.
They started Badminton Insight in April 2020 during the Covid-19 lockdown. Back in 2018, before the channel came into being they had to start a crowd-funding campaign for their first trip to Asia. Back then, Jenny (Moore as she was then known) was a Deliveroo rider working areas around the Loughborough town centre while Greg was a gatehouse security person, and also a part-time badminton coach at Nottingham Trent University. They were also pursuing a part-time Masters course. The YouTube channel, however, would prove life-changing.
The initial few videos on their channel are about training drills that badminton players can do while at home, like wall-hitting. In their latest video posted on the Badminton Insight channel, Greg and Jenny, 30 and 29, explained why they are quitting the sport now. “We’ve had to be self-funded pretty much throughout our entire career and this has presented many challenges. Competing in Europe and on the World Tour isn’t cheap. So, we’ve always had to have various part-time jobs alongside training over five hours a day, whether that’s stringing rackets, coaching five nights a week or working for Domino’s or Deliveroo,” Jenny said. “More recently, we’re lucky enough this channel has enabled us to stop doing these part-time jobs and made it possible for us to keep playing professional badminton.”
Sanket Chaudhury, who works as the Digital Media Coordinator of the International Hockey Federation, is one of the many who have benefitted  through their videos. “In my twenties, when I started playing badminton, it proved difficult to get the guidance required to fix certain aspects of my game I was struggling with and that’s where Jenny and Gregory came in. I’d practise techniques they’d teach at home, probably back-hand smashed a couple of light bulbs in the process, try them out in a session and come back to see what went right, what went wrong, and what the next step should be.”
Sanket, 30, who plays badminton in Lausanne when he is working and in Mumbai when he is home, started gleaning much more than just technique from the channel. The Vlogs and other interactive videos involving players on tour, meant their channel was always more than just a technique guide for him. “It provided a great opportunity to connect with badminton, and badminton players, in a personal way.” That is the main reason, Greg and Jenny say,  they are stopping their professional careers to put all their efforts and time into the YouTube channel.
“We believe we can reach more people, make a bigger difference and also try to grow the sport we love in a way that we never could as professional players,” Greg said. “We get so many comments and messages from you all saying that our videos have inspired you to get back into playing or helped you to improve your game. And this is honestly why we started the channel and what we want to spend all of our time doing now,” Jenny added.
From working part-time gigs and crowd-funding a trip to Asia, the Mairs finished their careers with another fine performance where they punched above their collective weight. They are now full-time content creators, and in this sphere, they can call themselves pioneers.

Title: Visa revoked by Trump administration for ‘supporting Hamas’, Indian PhD student at Columbia University self-deports
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/world/indian-student-columbia-university-deported-hamas-support-israel-gaza-war-9887017/
Content:
An Indian PhD student at Columbia University, whose visa was recently revoked by the Donald Trump administration for allegedly “advocating for violence and terrorism” and supporting Hamas, has self-deported and left the country.
Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen, entered the US on an F-1 student visa as a doctoral student in Urban Planning at Columbia University, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement Friday.
Stating that Srinivasan was “involved in activities supporting” Hamas, a terrorist organisation, the Department of State revoked her visa on March 5.
The department said it had obtained footage of Srinivasan using the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Home App to self-deport on March 11. “Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that one of the Columbia students who had her student visa revoked for advocating for violence and terrorism self-deported using the CBP Home App and ICE arrested a Palestinian student for overstaying her expired F-1 visa,” a DHS statement said.
It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live & study in the United States of America.
When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked and you should not be in this country.
I’m glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers… pic.twitter.com/jR2uVVKGCM
— Secretary Kristi Noem (@Sec_Noem) March 14, 2025
This comes shortly after another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was arrested by ICE HSI Newark officers for overstaying her student visa, which was terminated on January 26, 2022, for lack of attendance. In April 2024, Kordia was among those arrested for her involvement in pro-Hamas protests at Columbia University in New York City.
“It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the US. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathisers use the CBP Home app to self-deport,” Noem said in a statement.
The Trump administration has repeatedly red-flagged participation in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, equating it with support for Hamas. Columbia University, which has a sizable number of international students, including from India, has become a focal point in President Trump’s crackdown on campus activism.
In a letter issued late Thursday night, the administration demanded that Columbia’s Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies (MESAAS) be placed in on “academic receivership”, wherein an outside authority takes control, often as punishment for mismanagement.
The letter specified that the university must come up with a plan to create the academic receivership role no later than March 20. Failure to comply, the letter warned, would negatively affect “Columbia University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government”.
The university became an epicentre of pro-Palestinian protests in 2023 and 2024 as students rallied against the devastation caused by the war. More than 3,000 protesters are estimated to have been arrested by the police in a crackdown across campuses.
Last week, the Trump administration announced the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University due to the “school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students”.
After taking office on January 20, Trump immediately issued an executive order calling for the removal of foreigners who bear “hostile attitudes” to US “citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles” or who support “threats to our national security”.
As per the Columbia University website, Srinivasan holds a Bachelor’s in Design from CEPT University in Ahmedabad and was awarded the Fulbright Nehru and Inlaks Scholarships to pursue her master’s degree in Critical Conservation at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University.
Srinivasan’s research explored the continuities and transformations of caste rights within extractive economies in post-colonial India and received support from the Lakshmi Mittal South Asia Institute. She has also worked as a project associate at an environmental conservation and planning advocacy nonprofit in Washington, DC, and as a field researcher for international development agencies in South Asia.
The Department of Homeland Security launched the CBP Home app on March 10 with a self-deportation reporting feature for those illegally staying in the country. The CBP app gives such individuals the option to “leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream. If they don’t, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return”, the Homeland Security Department said.

Title: Clashes erupt during Holi celebrations in Jharkhand’s Giridih, vehicles set ablaze
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/jharkhand-giridih-holi-violence-9887148/
Content:
Violent clashes between two communities marred Holi celebrations in Jharkhand’s Giridih on Friday, leading to vehicles being set on fire and a brief disruption of peace in the district, local officials told news agency ANI.
The unrest erupted near Ghodthambha Chowk in Giridih when a Holi procession passed through a narrow street. An altercation broke out between members of two different communities, rapidly escalating into violence. The chaos lasted for about an hour before local authorities intervened to disperse the crowd, the officials said.
Authorities assured that the situation has since been brought under control, and no major injuries were reported. However, several vehicles were torched in the melee.
“We have identified some of the miscreants involved, and strict action will be taken against them,” Bimal Kumar, the Superintendent of police for Giridih, told ANI. “Security forces have been deployed to ensure that the situation remains under control. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries.”
Kumar emphasized that the investigation was ongoing, and efforts were being made to trace more individuals involved in the violence. In their immediate response, district officials, including members of the police force, arrived swiftly at the scene, helping to restore calm in the area.
The clashes were initially sparked by a confrontation between groups in the procession, but authorities are still probing the exact cause of the altercation. Deputy Development Commissioner Smita Kumari stated that “anti-social elements” had likely played a role in stoking the violence.
“During the Holi celebrations, a few anti-social elements tried to disrupt law and order, but the situation is now peaceful,” Kumari said. “The investigation is being carried out to determine who was behind this, and the police are keeping a close eye on the developments.”
Local officials, including Sub-Divisional Magistrate Animesh Ranjan, confirmed that peace had been restored by late Friday evening and that security forces would remain stationed in the area to ensure stability.
“The situation is fully under control now,” Ranjan said. “We acted swiftly, with the magistrate and forces already present in the area. Everything was contained in time, and there is no cause for concern at this point.”
Reacting to the incident, Jharkhand BJP president Babulal Marandi said that the state government should control the situation instead of politicising it. “People are supposed to play with colours on Holi, and if someone attacks them, then it is extremely concerning. The government talks about maintaining law and order, but is not doing anything.”

Title: Kardashian sisters’ wedding outfits were ‘pre-approved by the Ambani family’, Kim asked Manish Malhotra if her red dress was too….

Content:
Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian flew all the way from Los Angeles to Mumbai to attend the grand festivities of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant in July 2024. In the latest episode of their reality series The Kardashians, the sisters spoke about the 48 hours that they spent in the city of Mumbai. The sisters landed in Mumbai in the middle of the night and had to try on their wedding outfits for the next few hours. It appeared that Kim and Khloe had no idea what they were going to wear for the wedding and were presented with a rack full of options from Indian designers like Manish Malhotra.
Kim, who wore a red outfit for the wedding, said that she loves the colour but just never wears it. “I feel like I wear a lot of neutral colours so to wear all red just felt so special,” she said. Kim was also under the impression that one could not wear red in India in the olden days, as she said, “The Ambani family set us up with all these designers. In the olden days in India, you couldn’t wear red but now red is accepted so I am going to wear red.” As she was trying on her red outfit, Kim wondered if it was “too booby” but Manish assured her that this wasn’t the case.
Khloe revealed that all the designers they were working with were “pre-approved” by the Ambani family, which implied that all of their outfits were also approved by the family. “The designers that we have are people that are working with the Ambani family so everything is pre-approved by the family, of course,” she said. The sisters insisted that they loved their looks at the wedding.

In the same episode, the sisters revealed that they were overwhelmed by the lavishness of the wedding. “Real gold was painted on the stuff. Everything had diamonds. The cows had little foot cuffs with diamonds. The Ambani family even prayed to cows during the wedding ceremony,” Kim shared during the episode.
Kim and Khloe attended the two-day festivities in India after they got a 18-22 kgs invitation from the Ambani family.

Title: Years before they tied the knot, Alia Bhatt told Ranbir Kapoor what kind of man she’d never marry: ‘I’ve never been in love’

Content:
Both Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor had breakthrough roles in films directed by Imtiaz Ali. While Ranbir starred in the musical drama Rockstar, Alia proved her worth in the film Highway. She was only one movie old at the time, and many in the industry hadn’t taken her seriously after Student of the Year, her debut film, directed by Karan Johar. In a promotional interaction with her director Imtiaz Ali and Ranbir, Alia discussed what love means to her, and revealed what kind of man she’d never consider marrying. Alia, who turned 32 on Saturday, tied the knot with Ranbir around a decade after this interaction.
During the chat, Imtiaz appeared to come up with the premise of a movie for the two of them, a movie about a man with a mysterious past and a vibrant girl. “It’s like this guy isn’t used to being good to people, and this girl demands that people are good,” he said, leaving them both impressed.

Turning to Alia, Ranbir asked, “What’s your take on love? Right now, you’re one of those girls who’s like, ‘My career is the most important’…” Alia interrupted him, and said that she has never made this claim. “I’ve never been in love before,” she said. Ranbir continued, “Would you get married to somebody who didn’t want you to act?” Alia didn’t take a second to reply, “No.”
She explained, “I probably won’t act all my life, but I want to act for as long as I want. And if someone doesn’t want that for me, then you don’t want me. You want somebody else, and that person isn’t here, sorry.” Alia and Ranbir tied the knot in 2022, and welcomed their daughter, Raha, later that same year.
They worked together for the first time in Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra. Ranbir said at a press interaction this week that Ayan will begin working on the sequel after fulfilling his commitments to War 2, starring Hrithik Roshan and Jr NTR. Ranbir was last seen in Animal, while Alia last starred in Jigra. They are currently filming Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Love and War, also starring Vicky Kaushal.

Imagine having an entire airplane to yourself—no crowded aisles, no jostling for armrests, and the whole crew catering just to you. Sounds like a dream, right? That’s exactly what happened to one lucky traveller, whose experience as the sole passenger on a flight has now gone viral.
In the now-viral video, the unidentified man can be seen laughing at the surreal situation while seated in what appears to be his designated spot. Despite having only one passenger, the crew continues with their usual safety announcements. The text overlay on the video reads: “I was the only passenger on the entire flight, they literally asked me if I wanted to take off early.”
This man was the only passenger on the airplane 👀🤣 pic.twitter.com/8SZy1HxBbn
— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) March 12, 2025

With over 10 million views, the clip has sparked a wave of reactions online. Some were amused, some envious, and others simply baffled as to how this could happen. One X user turned to “Ask Perplexity” for answers, and the AI explained, “This can happen for a few reasons! Airlines sometimes operate flights with very few passengers because the plane needs to be repositioned to another airport for its next scheduled route, or to meet crew and cargo logistics. Additionally, airlines may still fly under-booked planes to retain valuable takeoff and landing slots at busy airports, a practice often referred to as ‘ghost flights’.”
The comments section was filled with hilarious takes. One person said, “And dude still sat in his designated seat? I’d be up front with the Captain.” Another pointed out the absurdity of the situation, saying, “The hilarious part is how the corporate drones just keep reading their announcements into the speaker to no one, because policy.”
Sharing his own experience, a user said, “Had this happen to me on the way home from Germany once. I mean, there were like five people on the plane but still lmfao. It was wild.”
While most people can only dream of such an experience, this video proves that sometimes, reality is stranger than fiction.

Title: US chef’s leftover Indian food cake has the Internet losing its mind: ‘Crime against my culture’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/us-chef-chicken-tikka-masala-cake-has-the-internet-losing-its-mind-viral-9886264/
Content:
What do you usually do with your leftover food? Most people either store it in the fridge for later or share it with others. But US Chef Josh Elkin takes things to a whole new level. A self-proclaimed Indian food lover, Elkin recently revealed his unconventional way of dealing with leftovers, and let’s just say — it has sparked some serious debate online.
In a viral video, Elkin explains, “Indian food is definitely one of my favourites, and I always over-order. You guys ask me all the time, what do you do with your leftovers? Well, I tend to make cakes out of them!” He then goes on to make a ‘Chicken Tikka Masala Cake’.
Yes, you read that right. A Chicken Tikka Masala Cake. His creation is a multi-layered masterpiece (or monstrosity, depending on who you ask), stacked with naan, chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, raita, and topped off with mint yogurt chutney. And because no cake is complete without toppings, he adds crispy onion bhajis and sirke wale pyaaz (pickled red onions) for the final touch. “Because let’s be honest—everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too,” he says with a grin.


A post shared by Josh Elkin (@thejoshelkin)

The video, which has racked up over 6 lakh views made a lot of netizens react to it. One user compared the experience to culinary blasphemy: “As an Indian, this made me finally realise how Italians feel when spaghetti is broken.” Another joked, “You need better planning if this is the amount of leftovers you have.”
The reactions only got funnier from there. “That’s a crime against my culture! My lawyers will be contacting you soon!” one person wrote, while another dramatically declared, “I’m not a violent person, but I’m going to go punch air.”
Some even (sarcastically, of course) called for Elkin’s immediate arrest for his food experiment.

Title: How Holi brings colour to the lives of the widows of Vrindavan
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-culture/holi-widows-of-vrindavan-9885503/
Content:
The holy township of Vrindavan, considered to be the place where Lord Krishna spent his childhood, has for centuries provided refuge to widowed Hindu women.
Widowhood among caste Hindus has long been stigmatised. Widows are expected to leave a life of austerity, and keep away from auspicious occasions. Seen as a drain on family finances, many find themselves in holy places like Vrindavan, where they live off the charity by the State, NGOs, and various temples and ashrams.
Nowadays, the festival of Holi brings some colour, although fleeting, to the otherwise austere lives of Vrindavan’s widows, giving them an opportunity to shun custom and engage in some fun.
“It is our life, and we must live it, and hope for better in the next,” a widow told The New York Times in 1998. A sense of resignation runs through the testimonies of Vrindavan’s widows.
Vrindavan today is home to thousands of widows, a majority (74%) of whom come from Bengal, according to a 2010 study by the National Commission of Women (NCW). It is believed that widows started to flock to Vrindavan from the time of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
The 16th-century Vaishnav saint from eastern India is said to have brought with him a group of widows to the town to escape sati, a now-banned practice which saw caste Hindu widows immolate themselves on their husbands’ funeral pyres.
While many widows come to Vrindavan of their own accord, often to escape physically and mentally abusive situations at home, others are simply abandoned at Vrindavan. But although Vrindavan may free them from daily indignations in the hands of their families, most live in penury.
The NCW 2010 report says, “The opportunities and facilities available in Vrindavan enable women to acquire two square meals a day and escape the taboos and harassment otherwise imposed upon them.” But, since a large proportion (nearly 90%) are unlettered, and many unfit for physical labour due to old age, two square meals is about the best they can get.
Colour in a town of ‘white’
White clothing, symbolising the relinquishment of worldly attachment and desires, is the most overt marker of widowhood among Hindus. On an average day, the narrow lanes of Vrindavan are flocked by women in white, begging for alms and singing hymns about Krishna.
Not on Holi. Not anymore, at least.
While there may have been isolated instances of widows playing Holi before, the first organised Holi celebration for widows was put together in 2013.
This was after the Supreme Court brought attention to the plight of Vrindawan’s widows in 2012. NGOs such as Sulabh International, which takes care of hundreds of widows in Vrindavan, have spearheaded the change.
“The celebration was a way of telling them they are one of us. They can wear coloured clothes, eat what they want. The ones who want to remarry, can,” Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh, told The Indian Express in 2014.
On Holi, these women sing traditional Holi songs in Braj Bhasha, play with colourful gulal, flowers, and coloured water. It is a joyous celebration for a people who are seldom allowed to feel happy.
“Colour vanished from my life after my husband died. I was just 20. I could not wear colourful clothes, or apply lali (colour) on my lips. I was shooed away from functions. Playing Holi was something I could not imagine,” 108-year-old Lalita Adhikari told The Indian Express in 2014. She spent over 70 years in Vrindavan.
This year, the UP government on Friday organised a Holi celebration for 2,000 widows in Vrindavan, in an attempt to set a Guinness world record for the sheer scale of the celebration. The certification process is still ongoing.
Yet poverty and social stigma faced by these widows year-long continue to weigh heavy. As the late Lalita Adhikari had said, “The state of widows is not going to change by playing Holi once.”

“The gut is at the center of our health. Healing your gut is the first step for optimising health and healthspan,” said Tanya Malik Chawla, a digital creator and “biohacker,” in an Instagram reel, and suggested taking a one-minute test to find out whether you are prone to acidity.
The test involves taking baking soda with water on an empty stomach. Baking soda (an alkali) will mix with stomach acid to produce carbon dioxide (gas), leading to burping. The time you take to burp is used as an indicator to decide whether a person has low stomach acid.
In her video, Chawla challenged a common misconception—that acidity is caused by excess stomach acid. Instead, she claimed that low stomach acid causes food to sit undigested in the gut, leading to fermentation and acid reflux (GERD).



A post shared by Tanya Malik Chawla (@tanyamalikbiohacker)
To verify Chawla’s claim, we consulted Meenu Balaji, chief nutritionist at Pragmatic Nutrition, Chennai, who told us that the test is a popular home method for assessing stomach acid production.
“Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid that breaks down food with other digestive enzymes. Many people experience acidity due to excess acid production, which is why antacids are commonly prescribed. However, insufficient stomach acid can also impact digestion and nutrient absorption, affecting gut health,” she said.
However, she pointed out that burping can occur for several reasons—low or high stomach acid, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), eating too quickly, or swallowing too much air. Therefore, according to Balaji, burping alone is not a reliable indicator of stomach acid levels.
“This is not a widely accepted, standardised diagnostic test. Some people with digestive issues burp even before eating, making it difficult to determine whether burping is caused by the baking soda or pre-existing conditions,” she said.
Balaji also said that stomach acid levels vary from person to person, and fluctuate throughout the day, making it even harder to draw conclusions based solely on burping.
According to Balaji, the most effective way to determine stomach acid levels is to consult a doctor about your symptoms. The doctor may recommend tests such as the Heidelberg pH test for a precise assessment.

Title: You are using the wrong mouse. Logitech has a better solution
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/logitech-mx-vertical-mouse-9886312/
Content:
When I was briefed about the Logitech MX Vertical mouse a few days ago, I wondered how a mouse could change my life. I didn’t pay much attention until I started using it and realised that those who spend a lot of time in front of computers silently suffer from inflammation in their wrists.
Although I take small breaks between work and avoid sitting in front of the computer unless necessary, as a tech journalist whose profession demands writing, I can’t escape the fatigue, stiffness, and shooting pain in my neck, shoulders, and wrists. I am sure it’s the same for you as well, and I am fully aware that many also suffer from tendonitis or, worse, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a nerve condition affecting the wrist and hands, where patients experience numbness or tingling in their fingers, particularly in their index fingers and thumbs.
I keep changing my position while working, moving around a lot from desk to couch, reading, and trying different sitting postures. I have even changed gears, but not once did I realise it could be a mouse problem (at least, part of it). Maybe Logitech figured out that changing your computer mouse is what’s needed to take control of your health and make changes in your lifestyle, which can help ease the pain in your hands or arms after a day of sitting in front of the computer. Its MX Vertical is not an ordinary computer mouse — it reduces strain on your wrist and is ergonomically designed. I have been using the Logitech MX Vertical mouse for a few days, and here’s my experience with it.
What: Logitech MX Vertical, Price: Rs 12,295 but the mouse typically sells for Rs 8,000 online.
The moment I took the MX Vertical out of the box, I asked myself, “What did Logitech do to the mouse?” It has an odd shape, and the MX Vertical barely looks like any mouse I am familiar with. It is indeed very different. Unlike a standard mouse, the MX Vertical is designed to be held in a handshake position, which means your thumb curves around one side, and the rest of your hand around the other. Since the body of the mouse curves at a 57-degree angle, it allows your arm to stay straight. This helps reduce muscle strain.
Pain in the wrists occurs when there is continuous effort in the same position over time. When you hold a heavy DSLR camera, the wrist position is not a “natural one,” and while you can use a tripod to reduce the strain, it doesn’t fully eliminate it. Similarly, if you use a mouse heavily all day long, we tend to ignore that it may not necessarily be made for your hand size or the awkward angle it puts your wrist in.
The mouse has a rubbery coating instead of a matte finish, and it’s a good thing because that prevents your hand from slipping when holding the mouse. The click area is made of a high-quality material, something you won’t find on affordable mice on the market. On top sits a button that, after installing the Logitech Options app, lets you change the cursor speed between two user settings. On the thumb side, you have two buttons that, by default, are configured for Forward and Back—ideal for browsing and checking PDF files. The scroll wheel moves gently, and the pointer and scroll speeds are easy to adjust. The mouse is completely silent; it makes zero noise.
The box comes with a USB-C cable, the Logitech Unifying USB dongle, and the mouse itself. The MX Vertical offers long battery life, rated to last four months, though it depends on daily usage. You can pair up to three devices with the mouse, which is great if you switch between multiple devices, like myself, who uses a Windows laptop, a Mac, and an iPad. The mouse is fully customisable, and its four buttons can be programmed once you download the Logi Options app.
I would like to point out that the MX Vertical is not a small mouse. It’s portable, but it’s larger than a typical mouse, so you will need a case or cover to store it, especially if you are a heavy traveller like myself, who doesn’t have a fixed desk and likes to move locations to work. I recommend using a mouse pad with the MX Vertical; it does make a difference. I haven’t tested the mouse on a glass desk, but since the laser sensor on the bottom is sensitive, it’s better to use a mouse pad.
It can take up to four days to get used to the mouse. There is no steep learning curve, but because the mouse is shaped differently, the first few days — mostly for the clicking part — may not go smoothly. At least, I felt a bit cumbersome using the mouse for the first few days.
Logitech says the mouse is designed for medium to large hands. My hands are small, and I had no trouble moving the mouse. After a day or two, I started getting used to the grip, and ever since I have been using the MX Vertical, I haven’t felt stiffness in my wrists. I still sit for long hours in front of the computer, but there is a slight difference (I am still figuring out what it is, but there’s definitely a change).
The truth is, all your workspace problems may not be solved in a day. You need to sit down and figure out where you’re making mistakes. Health is something I have been taking extra care of since the pandemic — and we all should take it seriously.
Maybe the Logitech MX Vertical seems like a big investment, but it’s cheaper than seeing a doctor or going for therapy. Hand strain and pain in the wrists are real issues, and many IT professionals suffer from them. In that context, this price seems small compared to the potential health problems it can help prevent in the long run.

Title: Anti-Russian activist shot dead in Odesa, Ukrainian authorities say
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/news-today/anti-russian-activist-demian-hanul-shot-dead-in-odesa-ukraine-9886853/
Content:
A prominent anti-Russian activist was shot dead in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Friday and law enforcement authorities said they were not ruling out Russian involvement in the killing.
A 31-year-old victim was named as Demian Hanul, a blogger who local media said took part in the 2014 Maidan revolution against Ukraine’s then pro-Russian president. He was also once a member of the far-right Right Sector group, media said.
“The incident is qualified as a premeditated murder committed by order,” national police said on Telegram.
The Security Service said a 46-year-old military deserter had been detained as a suspect.
Possible motives for the crime are being investigated, it said on local Telegram, adding that this included it being linked to Russia.
A video posted on local Telegram claimed to capture the moment of the shooting. It showed a burly man holding a gun to the head of a man lying on a pavement, possibly already dead, firing, and then walking away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the clip.
Russian state media has previously branded Hanul a neo-Nazi responsible for an arson attack on the Trade Union House in Odessa in May 2014, a reference to deadly fighting between pro-Russian activists and supporters of Ukrainian unity then.
A Moscow court charged Hanul in absentia in April 2024 with several crimes including damaging Soviet-era war monuments for which he would have faced up to 20 years in prison.
Several media outlets reported last July that Hanul had requested Ukrainian police protection after receiving threats.

Title: US aligns with G7, urges Russia to accept Ukraine ceasefire
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/world/g7-meet-canada-us-russia-ukraine-ceasefire-9886841/
Content:
The United States drew closer to its G7 allies on Friday, at least momentarily, to back Ukraine’s territorial integrity and warn Russia to follow Kyiv in accepting a ceasefire or face possible further sanctions.
Their joint foreign ministers’ communique followed weeks of tension between US allies and President Donald Trump over his upending of Western trade, security and Ukraine-related policy.
G7 officials had feared they would not be able to agree on an all-encompassing document touching on geopolitical issues from across the world, divisions that they said could have played into the hands of both Russia and China.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US felt good about the joint statement.
Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters: “When it comes to different issues, Ukraine and the Middle East, we’ve had sessions talking about these different issues, subjects, and the goal was to keep strong G7 unity.”
The Group of Seven ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, along with the European Union, convened in the remote tourist town of La Malbaie, nestled in the Quebec hills, for meetings on Thursday and Friday that in the past have been broadly consensual.
But in the run-up to the first G7 meeting of Canada’s presidency, the crafting of a final statement had been difficult with wrangling over the language regarding Ukraine, the Middle East and Washington’s desire for tougher wording on China.
The communique “reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty and independence.”
Ukraine’s territorial integrity has largely been absent from the US narrative since the Trump administration came to power on January 20. The US under Trump has so far not ruled out the possibility that Kyiv might cede territory.
Officials said they had been surprised by the United States’ signing off on parts of the Ukraine language, saying that American diplomats including Rubio were repeatedly asked whether the White House backed the language.
While satisfied with Friday’s outcome, which was in line with US efforts at present to pressure Russia, they cautioned that constant shifts by the Trump administration did not make the stance definitive.
“We felt really good about the statement, worked hard on it,” Rubio told reporters. “I said at the outset, which everybody agreed with, is that we’re not going to allow the things we disagree on – and we’ll disagree on things – to keep us from working closely on the things we agree on. There are a lot of those. And hopefully the statement reflects that, and our actions will reflect that.”
“The territorial integrity is an important element of the communique and the (reference) to the United Nations,” EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told Reuters, referring to a call for a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace in line with the Charter of the United Nations.”
An earlier text referring to the need for security guarantees to ensure a truce was replaced by “assurances,” but they did warn Moscow to follow Kyiv in agreeing to a ceasefire or face further sanctions, including oil price caps.
“G7 members called for Russia to reciprocate by agreeing to a ceasefire on equal terms and implementing it fully.
“They emphasised that any ceasefire must be respected and underscored the need for robust and credible security arrangements to ensure that Ukraine can deter and defend against any renewed acts of aggression,” they said in a reference to Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
British Foreign Secretary David Lam called the statement “very good.”
Washington had sought to impose red lines on language around Ukraine to not harm its talks with Russia and opposed a separate declaration on curbing Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, a murky shipping network that eludes sanctions, while demanding more robust language on China.
In the end the G7 also approved a separate statement on maritime security, including a task force to tackle the shadow fleet, something that Canada had pushed for.
G7 foreign ministers took a tough stance on China, stepping up language on Taiwan and omitting some conciliatory references and reassurances from past statements, including to “one China” policies, something sure to be a significant concern for Beijing.
There had been wrangling over language regarding Gaza and the Middle East, notably the notion of a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, something the US was resisting.
The final version made no mention of a two-state solution, dropping language that had stressed its importance in earlier drafts of the text.
The communique read: “They underscored the imperative of a political horizon for the Palestinian people, achieved through a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that meets the legitimate needs and aspirations of both peoples and advances comprehensive Middle East peace, stability and prosperity.”

Title: Russia will guarantee Ukrainian troops safety in Kursk if Kyiv surrenders: Putin after Trump appeal
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/world/vladimir-putin-us-russia-ukraine-donald-trump-kursk-war-9886850/
Content:
Hours after US President Donald Trump appeal to avoid a “horrible massacre”, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday said that Ukrainian troops surrounded in Russia’s western Kursk region would be spared if Kyiv ordered them to surrender.
Ukraine, however, has denied its soldiers were encircled, calling it a Russian fabrication. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the situation was “very difficult” but credited the Kursk operation with diverting Russian forces from other battlefronts.
Trump, in a social media post, claimed “thousands” of Ukrainian troops were “completely surrounded” and urged Putin to spare them, warning of a massacre “not seen since World War II.”
Putin responded in a Security Council meeting, saying he had read Trump’s appeal. While accusing Ukrainian forces of committing crimes against civilians—an allegation Kyiv denies—Putin said Russia would guarantee their lives and decent treatment under international law if they surrendered.
“To effectively implement the appeal of the US president, a corresponding order from the military-political leadership of Ukraine is needed for its military units to lay down their arms,” Putin said.
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, reinforced the ultimatum, warning Kyiv that if its forces refused to surrender, “they will all be methodically and mercilessly destroyed.”
Kursk has been a focal point of the war since August, when Ukraine launched a rare counter-invasion into Russian territory. Now, Russian forces are pushing to eliminate the last Ukrainian presence in the region, with Putin saying the troops face a choice: “surrender or die.”
Ukraine’s military dismissed reports of encirclement as Russian propaganda, saying its forces had successfully regrouped into stronger defensive positions.
Meanwhile, Russia’s defense ministry claimed its troops had recaptured Goncharovka, one of the few remaining Ukrainian-held settlements in Kursk. Ukraine’s border guard service also reported repelling a Russian reconnaissance attempt in neighboring Sumy.
The battlefield situation remains fluid as diplomatic pressure mounts, with the US calling for a broader ceasefire to halt the fighting.

Title: All England Open: Unforced errors, lack of discipline on court costs Lakshya Sen; Treesa-Gayatri also ousted by Chinese
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/badminton/all-england-open-badminton-lakshya-sen-treesa-gayatri-ousted-9886820/
Content:
A flick of a switch could turn a merry happy-Holi day into a wretched one, and it was the inevitability of power and strength from Chinese shuttlers that brought two decimations inside two hours. First, Lakshya Sen continued the trend of an underwhelming show in big matches, as Li Shifeng whom he’s beaten previously with steady plans, punctured his dreams of a third All England semi-final with a 21-10, 21-16 loss. Then Treesa Jolly-Gayatri Gopichand couldn’t escape the peppering that Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning routinely subject the opponents to, in a 21-14, 21-10 win.
While the Treesa-Gayatri result wasn’t shocking given how Liu-Tan are viewed as a pair that will change the basic ethos of women’s doubles through their power-game, the Sen result was worrying as he was neither nursing serious niggles, nor in poor form.
Both 21-10 scorelines will furrow brows. But Sen simply couldn’t stem the flow of errors as he failed to read the arena and the lengths he was expected to strike while going for the backline. Shifeng is an Asiad champion, having tasted success at Super 1000s before. Sen has never won Indonesia or All England before, but he’s always had the tools to stub Shifeng’s power-game, and make it look very piercable. He completely failed to even shake Shifengs defense on the day, and his go-to was the push to the back-line which he couldn’t control — neither the speed of the rush, nor the pelting force of the racquet frame, sending it long.
Nearly half the points he conceded in the opener came from these unforced errors. As a strategy it was worth trying to parry Shifeng back and cut through his defense. But the discipline to keep it within bounds was missing entirely. It’s like speed on tight corners, which needs precise steering and isn’t as straightforward as hitting the next gear, and going with the adrenaline flow to pull off outrageous winners. Like Chen Long before him, and Viktor Axelsen too, Shifeng’s defense is going to acquire economy of movements and absolute sturdiness. Sen stuck to one trick, and even that was scoring wretchedly on execution on the day with the overkill. His lifts were callous and made Shifeng look more formidable in his attack than he is.

His best chance was at the net with plenty of variations because in longer rallies with looping dribbles, he could frustrate the Chinese. But scores of 4-11, 9-17 and 10-20 point to a fair amount of cluelessness. The change in sides did nothing to turn the tide, though Sen was in striking distance at 10-11, and known to effect turnarounds. But without Vimal Kumar in his corner, even a 15-15 launchpad was soon frittered away for a 16-20 debacle.
There’s a heady rush associated with how Sen can play — like he did beating Jonatan Christie. But a calm, taller Chinese who just needs to bide his time before swatting Sen aside with a power-attack, was never going to be rolled over.
Of the younger lot jostling to take Axelsen’s crown, Sen has always struggled against Kunlavut and ground down by sheer defense by Kodai Naraoka. The All England loss to Shifeng, is a serious setback, and hitting the gym obsessively might not hold the answers. The game needs work. Resilience and ability to fight back is gone.
For Treesa-Gayatri, it wasn’t the mistakes per se, in fact they did what they could despite a scheduling horror — they finished their last match at 12.30 am IST and were back on court taking on World No.2 at 4.30 pm IST. A 16-hour turnaround time isn’t ideal, but Liu-Tan have literally been sleepwalking towards titles, on the force of their relentless attack that is thrice as hard hit as the next best WD shuttlers.

Like any Chinese, the defense leaves nothing to complain about for their coaches. Treesa would try plenty to vary the ripostes, and Gayatri remained rotationally sound. But there was little for the Indians to do when Liu and Tan soared and rained down smashes right through the middle of the court. It’s like how opponents must feel when Satwik-Chirag go on their smashing offensive. But additionally they foiled Gayatri’s attempts to take control of the net. This one time she moved the breadth of the court, parallel to the net striking down three winners. But she was largely kept at bay by the Chinese.
Perhaps, slowing them down was a way out. But the Indians did try and not manage to.
It was one of those sobering days when sport made it plain — physical power can completely wipe out opponents. All those 21-7 margins that PV Sindhu notched against Chen Yufei and Nozomi Okuhara — there was little those without power can slip in edgeways into a rally. There was little that was happy about this Holi on the sombre grey courts of Birmingham.

Title: Bengaluru special court rejects bail plea of actress Ranya Rao in 14.2 kg gold smuggling case
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-court-rejects-bail-plea-actress-ranya-rao-gold-smuggling-case-9886814/
Content:
A special court for economic offences in Bengaluru Friday rejected a bail plea filed by Kannada actress Ranya Rao in a case of gold smuggling which was registered after she was caught with 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore on her person at the Bengaluru International Airport on March 3 by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).
“The bail application filed by accused No.1 U/s.480 of BNSS, 2023 is hereby rejected,” the special magistrate’s court for economic offences ruled.
The DRI argued that the existence of a ‘Dubai resident card’ in the name of the actress posed a flight risk if she were to be granted bail.
The DRI has claimed that the gold smuggling at the Bengaluru International Airport was done by using state police protocol services and that the actress was intercepted after she claimed that she had nothing to declare at the customs section and used a green channel to exit the area.
The burden of proof in disproving a smuggling case where contraband goods are found on a person lies with the person itself, the DRI counsel argued.
Ranya Rao is incidentally the stepdaughter of a senior police officer in Karnataka of the rank of director general of police. In the bail arguments on Wednesday, the DRI also placed in court a statement given by the police protocol official at the airport which stated that he had been instructed by the DGP to provide protocol services to his family.
The protocol officer’s statement indicated that he was called on March 3 by Ranya Rao and informed of the need for protocol service on her arrival from Dubai.
“The international links need to be probed. The preliminary probe suggests that she is arranging money from sources. How the money was transferred has to be investigated and the probe suggests she arranged for the purchase and transport,” the DRI counsel argued.
In documents placed in the court, the DRI referred to customs declarations made in Dubai by the actress during past visits to the UAE – which were found at her home during a search after her arrest.
The customs declarations dated November 13, 2024, and December 20, 2024, indicate that she had claimed in Dubai that she was transporting gold consignments to Geneva but instead moved the gold to India, the DRI has indicated. The DRI has said that the actress evaded customs duty to the tune of Rs 4.83 crore by smuggling 14.2 kg of gold on March 3.
The DRI said Ranya Rao is a key player in a gold smuggling syndicate. The DRI has also arrested an associate of the actress, Tarun Konduru Raju alias Virat Konduru, a Telugu actor, who allegedly procured the gold in Dubai at the instance of the actress and gave it to her for transporting to India. Raju is also linked to a prominent business family in Bengaluru.
Raju, who was arrested on March 9 by the DRI – six days after the actress, moved the court for bail on Friday and the matter was posted for objections by the DRI.

Something’s going on – but what? The whole tone of the week is likely to be coloured by a vague feeling that some sort of major event is looming, but you’ll be unable to put your finger on the details before next weekend. In any case, you’re in a strong position today, so with a little effort in the right places you’ll make the most of it.
Read Taurus  Horoscope Predictions Here
The financial situation is still deeply uncertain, and there still seems to be a risk of much higher than expected costs. On the other hand, the stars are suggesting that if you want to splash out on luxuries, pleasures and objets d’art, then so be it.
Read Gemini  Horoscope Predictions Here
As a Cancer you prefer not to face situations head on. Sometimes your tendency to approach life sideways can be a problem, but right now the indirect approach may serve you very well. How about moving forward in your typical sideways, crab-like manner?
Read Cancer  Horoscope Predictions Here
You have so much to offer. In fact, this is your time to save the world. Or at least, that’s what you may think. First, you need to make sure that you actually know what other people want. Keep secret ambitions under review. It may soon be time to break your cover and make your intentions clear.
Read Leo  Horoscope Predictions Here
Although there’s still plenty of time to make professional plans and steer other ambitions back on course, the time for glory may have passed, at least for a little while. Your romantic stars are heading for a burst of brilliance in a couple of weeks’ time, so you can begin to fill up your diary.
Read Virgo  Horoscope Predictions Here
Your ability to reconcile rivals and hold different factions together is one of your undoubted strengths, but this week you must calculate whether your peace- making efforts will be worth it. You’ve got some pretty strong opinions today, but that doesn’t mean that you’re always right!
Read Libra  Horoscope Predictions Here
Important developments in your intimate life are likely within the next two weeks. It is vital that you take a long-term view of partnership matters right away, otherwise you’ll be wrong-footed later. The last thing you want to do now is surrender your lead or squander your advantages.
Read Scorpio  Horoscope Predictions Here
Sometimes you have to yield to a superior force, if only temporarily. Unfortunately, you are no longer in any position to lay down the law or force the pace. There seems to be a tiny matter of an issue of principle to sort out first, although a less promising week for getting to the facts cannot be imagined
Read Sagittarius  Horoscope Predictions Here
Deep down you know that the moment is not yet right to burn your boats. Yet with Mars, the fiery planet, intimately linked with Saturn, planet of limits and boundaries, the symbolism is right for a definite, if rather confused, break. But, of course, you have to do it without letting anyone down.
Read Capricorn  Horoscope Predictions Here
Optimism at work is one thing but, if you move too fast, then others will be left behind this week. You’ll then be on a downward slope of misunderstandings, arguments and eventually a falling out. Take the trouble to explain yourself and keep friends and relations on your team.
Read Aquarius  Horoscope Predictions Here
Jupiter is your protector, but it is being undermined by various other irritating planets, so you may succumb to confusion and muddles. You have a choice, of course – revert to being a typically irresponsible Piscean for the duration! A little forward planning would help!

Title: Priyanka Chopra’s brother Siddharth was ‘overshadowed’ by her during his childhood, says mom Madhu: ‘Mine and his father’s influence wasn’t much’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/priyanka-chopra-brother-siddharth-was-overshadowed-by-her-during-his-childhood-says-mom-madhu-9887109/

Priyanka Chopra was on her way to becoming a global star when she won Miss World in the year 2000. After this, she moved to Mumbai to start her film career and her mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, moved with her as Priyanka tried to find her way in the film industry. But while Priyanka’s parents were supporting her through her film journey, her younger brother, Siddharth, grew up with his grandparents and was “overshadowed” by his sister’s success.
In a recent chat with Lehren Retro, Madhu spoke about Siddharth’s childhood as he grew up under the shadow of his successful sister. “Sometimes, I feel that, but he turned out all right. He landed on his feet. He is quite an independent, free thinking person. He is very different personality. With him, it was that without any internal influences… I mean family can become clawing sometimes, he grew up without that influence and he just grew up. He grew up with both his grandmothers,” she said.
Madhu shared that he is a “very responsible child” but added, “But many times I feel that during his growing up years, when he was a teenager, his father’s influence wasn’t much, my influence also wasn’t much, the grandmothers were the primary caretakers. He had a very pampered life.” She recalled that Priyanka would take Siddharth along to her shoots, or whenever she was going out for her shows. Talking about being overshadowed, Madhu said that all of them were overshadowed by Priyanka. “Even a blade of grass won’t grow behind a big banyan tree,” she said. Siddharth recently got married to Neelam Upadhyaya. The wedding was attended by Priyanka.

In the same chat, Madhu recalled when Priyanka moved to the US for the first time at the age of 13 and started studying there. “My sister said that education is better in the US but that’s not true at all. Education is so much better in India but the environment was better there for overall well-rounded development,” she said. Madhu’s sister was living in the US and was ready to be Priyanka’s guardian for the time she studied there.
But, amid all this, Priyanka’s father Ashok Chopra wasn’t in favour of Priyanka moving abroad and live without her parents. “Papa said, see, she is a teenager, this is not the right age for her to live there. She should be with her parents at this time. I said that is not something we should worry about. She will live with my sister, and she is strict, she will do a good job,’ she recalled.
Priyanka lived in the US for three years and in this time, she did not live with her parents. Her mother visited her next when she was 16 after Priyanka got in a fight at school. After that, she moved back to Bareilly.

Established in 2005, the James Dyson Award will support the selected student who will claim a prize of £30,000 (approx. Rs 30 lakhs), and a chance to gain international media exposure, providing a springboard to commercialise their inventions.
Entrants are required to explain their invention, how it works, and the development process they followed. The best submissions effectively address a real problem, provide a clear explanation, demonstrate iterative development, include evidence of prototyping, and feature supporting images and a video, according to the official notification.
Entries will initially be judged at the national level by a panel of external judges and a Dyson engineer. Each participating market will recognize a national winner and two national runners-up. From the national winners, a panel of Dyson engineers will select an international shortlist of the top 20 entries. These top 20 projects will then be reviewed by Sir James Dyson, who will choose the international winners.
Entrants must currently be, or must have been within the last four years, enrolled for at least one semester in an undergraduate or graduate program related to engineering or design. This program must be at a university located in a region participating in the James Dyson Award.
For team entries, all members must also be, or have been within the last four years, enrolled for at least one semester in an undergraduate or graduate program at a university within an eligible region. At least one team member must have studied a qualifying subject in engineering or design. Those participating in a degree-level apprenticeship at Level 6 or Level 7, as well as those who have completed such an apprenticeship in the last four years, are also eligible to enter the award.

Odisha-based Komal Panda was the national winner of India for the James Dyson Award 2024 for her innovation, Novocarry, a portable cooling carrier that helps keep insulin and other liquid medication under desired temperatures. The national winner received a prize money of approximately Rs 5 lakh.
Novocarry’s advanced cooling technology preserves insulin potency during long-distance travel, even in areas with limited electricity, and its powerful battery doubles as a charging station, making it a uniquely versatile solution. Komal’s inspiration came from her father who used to struggle to store and transport insulin due to the lack of refrigeration at his office.

Title: ‘States should not lose proportional share’: Pinarayi voices delimitation concerns, expresses solidarity with Stalin
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pinarayi-vijayan-delimitation-concerns-solidarity-stalin-9887178/
Content:
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday expressed solidarity with the M K Stalin-led Tamil Nadu government’s stand on the issue of the impending delimitation of Lok Sabha seats and backed the March 22 meeting called by his counterpart on the issue.
Tamil Nadu Minister for IT and Digital Services Palanivel Thiagarajan and Lok Sabha MP Thamizhachi Thangapandian on Friday visited Vijayan and invited him on behalf of Stalin to the proposed meeting.
An official communication from the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office said Vijayan expressed his solidarity with the meeting on the issue. The Tamil Nadu leaders invited Vijayan for the meeting against the Centre’s move to redraw Lok Sabha constituencies “flouting the values of democracy and federalism”, said the release.
Later, Vijayan issued a statement saying delimitation should be carried out without reducing the existing proportional share of seats of any state. The Union government’s arguments that the south Indian states would get additional seats on a pro-rata basis cannot be taken at face value, he said. “The Centre has not been able to clarify whether this pro-rata distribution will be based on the percentage of the current parliamentary seats or on the basis of population figures. In either case, south Indian states are bound to lose representation,” he said.
“States that have effectively implemented population control measures should not be punished. It is unfair to reduce the proportional representation in Parliament of states that have reduced their population in accordance with the population control programmes and family planning policies introduced by the Union government after Independence. It would be tantamount to rewarding the states that have failed in all these,” the Chief Minister’s statement said.
He demanded that the Centre alleviate the fears of the south Indian states and said it was the Union government’s responsibility to refrain from unilateral measures and preserve the essence of democracy and federalism.

Title: Hidden Stories: A unique jazz club in Pune keeps the music alive
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/hidden-stories-unique-jazz-club-pune-music-9887139/
Content:
On the first Sunday of every month, Shisha Cafe at The Mills in Pune opens its doors to a unique cohort – the Pune Jazz and Blues Club. An eclectic group of people streams in to understand and celebrate the complexities that layer these genres of music and the great artists who made it all happen.
“Our objective is to communicate to people different aspects of the music that they would not be aware of. With the help of experts, we give information and entertain, so our sessions become infotainment,” says Ashwin Panemangalore, 82, one of the names at the forefront of keeping the music playing in the city.
On March 2, the club had a listening experience ‘Vocal Jazz Odyssey’ featuring vocal harmony groups in jazz that have rarely received the attention they deserved. Last month’s session was an audio-visual presentation on jazz drums and how artists produce an array of percussion sounds using instruments ranging from brushes and mallets to cymbals and different drums. The year had started with another audio-visual presentation, on the legendary John McLaughlin. Before that, there were sessions on Quincy Jones, jazz guitars and the evolution of the jazz piano.
“As an art form, jazz is one of the richest in the performing arts in terms of the number of sub-genres of the music, the complexity of the styles and its evolution. There is a jazz tree that reflects the different sub-genres,” adds Ashwin.
What a wonderful world
Ashwin was always fond of music, even at St Vincent’s High School in Camp where he studied. But it was when he went to College of Engineering, Pune (COEP) to study engineering that Ashwin, who had not listened to jazz until then, watched a few movies on the musical form, especially the 1959 film The Five Pennies about a jazz musician. “I went and got a couple of LPs from Poona Music House on Main Street. It is no longer there now. The LPs were about swing, a popular sub-genre in jazz. That is how my journey started,” he says.
A college friend told Ashwin about a Voice of America radio programme by Willis Conover that used to broadcast jazz every day. “My room partner bought a radio and we would fiddle with the dial and listen to the music over the static. I carried that on after college,” he says.
A young member of the club, Kevin Thomas Bhosle, says that he explored different music genres in his teenage years and “jazz music hit me like no other”. “I was quite keen on learning more about jazz and its rich history. That is when I found out about the club through their Facebook page and started attending their meets. I loved the concept of having live music at the meets. It helped me better understand the nuances of jazz music, and also get to know local jazz musicians in the scene,” he says.
Bhosle has been playing brass instruments since he was 10 and, initially, was only exposed to classical music. “I was hooked on jazz after hearing the jazz greats on the internet. I was greatly inspired when I first heard Roque Vaz, one of Pune’s finest jazz trumpeters, playing with Aubrey Dias, Ashdin Bharucha and Albert Dennis – together called ‘Impressions’,” he says.
Every jazz aficionado has a story about their experiences with the music. In 2002, a bunch of them got together to exchange music and listen to it together. That is how the Pune Jazz Club came into being as an initiative of a Vancouver-returned businessman Ahmed Ebrahim. “It was a simple concept because the music is not all that popular. The number of people who like it is few, and the number of jazz albums that are available is fewer,” says Ashwin.
In a sentimental mood
The club was a monthly fixture, with 100 people attending the meets at the Max Mueller Bhavan on Boat Club Road, for a few years before it tapered off. By 2012, Ebrahim had decided to close the club as few people were coming in. That is when a few jazz lovers, including Ashwin and Shisha Cafe founder Mehdi Niroomand, decided to reinvent and rebuild it. Pune Jazz Club became Pune Jazz and Blues Club. The renewed purpose became not only about sharing music but also spreading awareness about its themes, elements and nuances. They began to gather at a cultural centre, Gyaan Adab in Kalyani Nagar. Oceanic Sound, a musical equipment store, provided sound equipment for the Pune Jazz and Blues Club.
Jazz has a rich and deep history entwined with movements and social turmoil, including Black history. As it reached out to new listeners, the Pune Jazz and Blues Club embarked on its own winding journey that involved scouting for suitable locations, changing addresses and taking a pause during COVID. “Amid the lockdown, the club and its activities had vanished. I was eagerly missing the club activities and wanted to introduce everyone I met to this beautiful music. I did not see anyone apart from uncle Ashwin trying to take the club forward. I reached out to him and we decided to restart the club. He tasked me with preparing for a session. We got in touch with Mehdi Niroomand, who readily agreed to restart jazz club meetings at Shisha. We restarted the club activities in early 2023,” adds Bhosle.
Entry is free and an average session today draws around 20 participants. While most are aware of the genre and want to know more, there is a small core group of experienced jazz listeners too. “The important people we are looking for are the ones who are interested, know a little bit but would like to know more,” says Ashwin.
Bhosle adds that jazz music is considered boring and outdated but it is an ever-evolving genre that will never die. “The intent of the club is to share the beauty of jazz music with everyone and also simultaneously create a platform for local budding jazz artists to showcase their love for jazz. In the near future, we intend to bring many more engaging activities to our meets. Stay tuned for more,” he says.

Title: Trump says he was being ‘bit sarcastic’ when he promised to end Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/news-today/trump-bit-sarcastic-end-russia-ukraine-war-9887120/
Content:
President Donald Trump said Friday that he was “being a little bit sarcastic” when he repeatedly claimed as a candidate that he would have the Russia-Ukraine war solved within 24 hours – and even before he even took office.
Trump was asked about the vow he repeatedly made on the campaign trail during an interview for the “Full Measure” television programme as his administration is still trying to broker a solution 54 days into his second term.
“Well, I was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that,” Trump said in a clip released ahead of the episode airing Sunday. “What I really mean is I’d like to get it settled and, I’ll, I think, I think I’ll be successful.” It was a rare admission from Trump, who has a long record of making exaggerated claims.
Trump said at a CNN town hall in May 2023, “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done – I’ll have that done in 24 hours.” “That is a war that’s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president,” Trump said during his September debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. “If I win, when I’m president-elect, and what I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other. I’ll get them together.” The Republican repeated the claim frequently on the campaign trail.
His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow this week for talks on a US-proposed ceasefire, which Ukraine has accepted.
In the interview, Trump was also asked what the plan would be if Putin does not agree to a ceasefire to the war he started three years ago.
“Bad news for this world because so many people are dying,” Trump said.
But I think, I think he’s going to agree. I really do. I think I know him pretty well and I think he’s going to agree.”

Title: Gene Hackman reportedly leaves kids out of his will: What happens to his $80 million estate?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/gene-hackman-reportedly-leaves-kids-out-of-his-will-what-happens-to-his-80-million-estate-9887116/
Content:
Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead on February 26, 2025. While the investigation into their deaths is still ongoing, reports claim that Hackman’s will has already been unearthed. According to TMZ, the Hollywood star left every single penny of his fortune to his beloved wife, whom he married back in 1991. But here’s where things get complicated. TMZ obtained documents showing that Hackman had made Betsy his sole beneficiary as far back as 1995. Now, with both of them gone, and with the timing of their deaths so close together, what happens to Gene Hackman’s $80 million fortune?
The two-time Academy Award winner reportedly left nothing to his three children: son Christopher, and daughters Leslie and Elizabeth. According to the documents, Betsy also had her own will. She had left most of her assets to Gene but added a condition: if they both died within 90 days of each other, it would be considered a “simultaneous death.” In that case, her will stated that her entire estate would go to charity.

The couple lived in New Mexico, which follows community property laws, and the fact that they had no prenuptial agreement makes things even messier. This could mean Betsy’s estate holds solid value, and because of her will’s clause, her share may ultimately go to charity. As for Gene’s estate, even though he didn’t name his children in his will, they would likely inherit his share of the fortune as his direct living heirs.
While details are still emerging, authorities earlier revealed that Betsy died from a rare hantavirus pulmonary disease on February 11. Gene reportedly passed away just days later, on February 18, from heart disease. Authorities in their initial report said that Gene, who was battling advanced-stage Alzheimer’s, might not have been fully aware of his wife’s condition at the time. The couple also owned three dogs. Sadly, one of them, an Australian Kelpie, was found locked inside a crate and reportedly died from starvation and dehydration. The other two dogs survived and are currently in the care of animal welfare authorities.

Title: Putin’s conditions on Ukraine war, ex-Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest and train hijack in Pakistan: the world this week
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/upsc-current-affairs/upsc-essentials/putin-russia-ukraine-war-duterte-arrest-pakistan-train-hijack-9887114/
Content:
Welcome to this week’s roundup of key global events and developments shaping politics, economics, and society. From groundbreaking policy shifts and diplomatic manoeuvres to emerging stories of resilience and upheaval, we bring you the latest updates and insights. For Indian audiences, understanding these developments is not just about keeping informed — it’s about identifying the ripple effects that could influence India’s foreign policy and its position in an increasingly fragmented world.
Whether it’s a headline grabbing the world’s attention or an underreported issue with far-reaching consequences, we aim to provide a clear, concise, and comprehensive overview of the top seven moments from this week in international politics.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that any pause in the conflict in Ukraine must lead to a comprehensive resolution addressing its “root causes.” “The idea in itself is correct, and we support it unconditionally. But there are issues that we must discuss,” Putin said at a press conference, emphasising that a ceasefire can only work if it leads to a final settlement. He warned that without these conditions, Ukrainian forces could “retreat, regroup and re-arm,” potentially undermining Russian advances, notably in regions such as Kursk.
Adding to the situation’s complexity, US and Ukrainian delegations met in Saudi Arabia this week to negotiate an interim 30-day ceasefire covering land, sea, and air operations. However, Putin’s preconditions, including Ukraine’s recognition of Russia’s annexation of parts of southeastern regions and Crimea, withdrawal from these territories, and a firm commitment to never joining Nato, indicate that Moscow sees these terms as essential for “solving the root causes” of the conflict.
In response, US President Donald Trump described Putin’s remarks as “a very promising statement” yet “incomplete,” noting that his team was engaged in “very serious discussions” with the Russian leader. Trump’s comments reveal the high stakes: detailed discussions have already touched on “pieces of land that would be kept and lost” as well as the allocation of energy assets.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy labelled Putin’s response as “manipulative” and emphasised the need for additional sanctions on Russia. Zelenskyy also highlighted the irony in Putin’s reluctance to commit, remarking that while the Russian president “doesn’t say no directly,” his practical preparations point to an outright rejection of any ceasefire that fails to meet Moscow’s stringent demands.
The dialogue reflects broader geopolitical tensions. Russia’s insistence on a rollback of Nato’s eastward expansion and its demand for limits on Ukraine’s armed forces to just 50,000 personnel, signals an effort to reconfigure the security landscape in Eastern Europe. As both sides continue to negotiate, the ceasefire debate remains a microcosm of the wider struggle over regional influence and security guarantees.
Key developments:
· Putin demanded Ukraine recognise Russia’s annexation of four southeastern regions and Crimea, withdraw its troops, and pledge never to join Nato.
· US and Ukrainian delegations met in Saudi Arabia to discuss a 30-day ceasefire and long-term security guarantees for Kyiv.
· Trump called Putin’s comments “very promising” but noted that “a lot of details” still need to be resolved.
· Ukrainian President Zelenskyy criticised Putin’s response as “manipulative” and called for additional sanctions on Russia.
· Russia continues to advance militarily along the nearly 1,000 km frontline, complicating ceasefire discussions.
China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) recently wrapped up its annual parliamentary session, sending a multi-layered message to investors and global policymakers. In a week-long gathering that brought together about 5,000 delegates, Chinese leaders underlined their commitment to “stabilising both development and security” amid an increasingly volatile international environment.
At a press conference, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, “The world today is interwoven with turmoil, and certainty is increasingly becoming a scarce resource globally.” This statement underscored China’s dual aim: to project an image of stability and to assure both domestic and international audiences that Beijing is prepared to steer the nation through complex challenges.
Premier Li Qiang’s work report further amplified this message. Notably, he introduced the term “embodied AI” — a reference to AI-powered robots and machines that signal Beijing’s intent to innovate in high technology. The report also revealed an 8.3 per cent rise in tech-sector spending for 2025, a figure that dwarfs fiscal spending increases and hints at a strategic pivot toward domestic technological advancement. As one delegate put it, “Humanoid robots have a promising future,” a sentiment echoed by experts who see this as a critical response to what they term “the American technology chokehold.”
Yet, the meeting was not solely about technological prowess. Chinese officials also discussed the challenges facing the economy, including reduced foreign direct investment and a “complex and severe situation of increasing external pressure.”
Parallel meetings with provincial delegations stressed the importance of bolstering domestic demand while also expanding alliances with emerging economies, particularly those in the global south. This nuanced balancing act reflects Beijing’s recognition that economic resilience and strategic partnerships will be vital in countering a more hostile international order.
Key takeaways:
· Premier Li Qiang emphasised boosting domestic demand and technological self-sufficiency, with AI development highlighted as a priority.
· Beijing pledged increased funding for tech innovation, particularly in AI and semiconductor manufacturing, in response to US-led restrictions on Chinese access to advanced chips.
· Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed China’s commitment to the Global South, positioning Beijing as a stabilising force in an uncertain world.
In the Gulf of Oman, warships from Iran, China, and Russia embarked on their annual Security Belt-2025 naval exercises, marking the fifth such joint drill since 2019. These manoeuvres are not just military routines, they are deliberate displays of a deepening strategic partnership among countries that share a common interest in countering Western influence.
The drills come at a time when Trump has been reconfiguring longstanding alliances, emphasising that the US is “stronger than all of them” despite the growing coordination among its adversaries. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seized the opportunity to criticise the West, accusing Washington of “insisting on negotiations” that aim to “dominate and impose their own expectations.” This rhetoric highlights the broader ideological divide: while the West seeks to uphold a rules-based international order, this emerging axis of authoritarianism is increasingly prepared to set its own terms.
The exercise not only demonstrates military interoperability but also serves as a counterpoint to the US “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran. Analysts argue that the drills symbolise a unified response to perceived external threats, reinforcing the idea that the growing partnerships among Iran, Russia, and China could alter the balance of power on a global scale.
India balances ties with Iran (via the Chabahar port), Russia, and the US. These drills could impact Gulf stability, affecting India’s energy security and regional interests.
Key developments:
· The US downplayed the drills, with Trump stating, “We’re stronger than all of them.”
· Iran accused Washington of trying to impose excessive restrictions, particularly regarding its nuclear program.
· US lawmakers warned that growing ties between China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea could pose a multifaceted challenge to Western interests.
The attack on the Jaffar Express has cast a long shadow over Pakistan’s security landscape. The train, carrying 440 passengers from Quetta to Peshawar, was hijacked by armed militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Over the 30-hour siege, hostages were subjected to extreme terror — some remaining motionless on the floor for up to 27 hours, while others could only gasp in shock as the attackers executed passengers.
Train driver Amjad said, “As soon as the train stopped, BLA terrorists launched an attack. They breached the train by smashing windows, but they mistakenly believed we were dead.”
In a final military operation, Pakistani security forces killed all 33 militants involved, and 21 civilians and four security personnel also died.
The attack also underscored the ethnic and regional tensions at play. Survivors reported that the militants even separated passengers based on their region of origin, a grim reminder of the long-standing grievances that fuel insurgency in the region. BLA’s claim of holding 214 hostages and executing “captive enemy personnel” only deepens the narrative of a group determined to leverage violence to force political concessions.
National leaders and security officials have denounced the attack as “a cowardly act of terrorism,” highlighting the urgent need to address the deteriorating security situation in a nation already beset by multiple challenges.
Key details:
· Survivors described a brutal attack where militants targeted passengers based on their regional origin.
· The BLA demanded the release of its activists in exchange for hostages.
· Pakistan accused India of “sponsoring terrorism,” a claim India strongly denied, stating that Islamabad should “look inwards.”
In one of the week’s most dramatic developments, former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte was transferred to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity stemming from his notorious anti-drug campaign. Arrested on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant — issued over operations that left thousands dead — Duterte’s detention has ignited fierce political debates and highlighted deep-seated rivalries.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr defended the arrest, arguing that it was “in compliance with our commitments to Interpol” and necessary for upholding international law. In stark contrast, Sara Duterte, the former president’s daughter and current vice president, decried the move as a “blatant affront to our sovereignty.” Video footage from Villamor air base showed Duterte boarding an aircraft for The Hague, symbolising a pivotal moment in what has become a bitter feud between political dynasties.
Duterte’s arrest is not only about legal accountability but also reflects a broader struggle over the nation’s geopolitical orientation. While Duterte’s policies once aligned more closely with a pro-China stance, President Marcos Jr has been steering the Philippines back toward traditional US alliances. The public spat underscores that the internal political dynamics of the Philippines continue to be as volatile as its external relations.
Key points:
· Duterte was transferred to The Hague, with his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, calling it a “blatant affront to sovereignty.”
· President Ferdinand Marcos Jr insisted the arrest complied with international obligations, amid an ongoing political feud between the two families.
· ICC accuses Duterte of overseeing systematic killings of thousands of civilians under his anti-drug campaign.
Syria once again plunged into violence as forces loyal to ousted president Bashar al-Assad have launched attacks along the Mediterranean coast. A shadowy group, calling itself the Military Council to Liberate Syria, has declared an insurgency against the government led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). This outbreak of violence, which has already resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties, has raised fears of a resurgence of loyalist insurgency that could undo years of tenuous stability.
UN officials have verified the killing of at least 111 civilians since the violence erupted, though many believe the true number is much higher. Eyewitness accounts describe summary executions carried out in a manner that appears distinctly sectarian, with predominantly Alawite areas targeted. A UN spokesperson noted that “entire families, including women and children, were killed” in some cases. The violence has compelled the government to impose curfews and deploy reinforcements in the affected regions, while also prompting calls for an independent investigation into the brutal tactics employed by armed groups.
The renewed clashes not only highlight the ongoing challenges of post-civil war Syria but also underscore the difficulty of forging national unity in a landscape scarred by decades of conflict. As the government grapples with a potentially fractious opposition and the economic burden of rebuilding, the situation in Syria remains one of the most volatile in the region.
Key details:
· Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, promised accountability but struggles to contain sectarian violence.
· The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that entire families were executed.
· UN Human Rights Office described the killings as “disturbing” and warned of escalating humanitarian crises.
To address what it describes as a failing return policy, the European Union is preparing to implement a controversial plan to relocate hundreds of thousands of migrants to “return hubs” outside the bloc. Vice-President Henna Virkkunen of the European Commission criticised the current system, arguing that its inefficacy has “fuelled the rise of far-right parties” across member states.
Under the proposed scheme, a unified return decision would be applied EU-wide to prevent asylum seekers from moving between countries to avoid deportation. Migrants whose claims have been rejected and who do not cooperate by, for instance, destroying identity documents, could face detention for up to two years. German political heavyweight Friedrich Merz, campaigning on tougher migration policies, has called for stricter border controls and an entry ban for asylum seekers. Such proposals are seen as a necessary response to the perceived security risks posed by irregular migration, despite concerns raised by humanitarian groups.
Magnus Brunner, the EU migration commissioner, argued that “removing those without a right to stay is vital” to prevent abuse of the system. However, the plan has been met with strong criticism from members of European Parliament (MEPs) representing centre-left and Green parties, who label the hubs as draconian measures likely to lead to human rights abuses. By emphasising that unaccompanied minors and families with children would be exempt from these measures, EU aims to balance enforcement with adherence to international human rights standards — a challenge that remains at the forefront of migration debates in Europe.
Key points:
· The proposal aims to curb illegal immigration amid rising far-right influence in European politics.
· Migrants would be sent to hubs only after their asylum claims are rejected.
· The plan faces criticism from human rights groups and opposition from left-leaning EU politicians.

Content:
Actor Vicky Kaushal’s blockbuster film Chhaava has dethroned Shah Rukh Khan’s Pathaan at the domestic box office. The historical drama, directed by Laxman Utekar, is now the ninth-biggest Hindi film of all time. On its fifth Thursday in theatres, Chhaava made over Rs 4 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. The movie showed an uptick in collections on Friday, as it amassed a total of Rs 7.25 crore across the country, with the Telugu version contributing as well.
The film’s nett domestic total stands at Rs 546 crore, which puts it Rs 3 crore ahead of Pathaan. Chhaava overcame the 6.25 per cent dip that it witnessed on Thursday and posted better numbers, despite a fresh challenge from the John Abraham-starrer The Diplomat, which made Rs 4 crore on opening day. The Hindi version of Chhaava contributed Rs 6.5 crore and the Telugu version added Rs 75 lakh to Friday’s collection.

On Friday, Chhaava recorded an overall occupancy rate of 28.35% in the Hindi market and 22.84% in the Telugu market. The morning shows started with 11.20% and 16.54% respectively with the occupancy improving as the day went ahead – rising to 29.96% and 25.50% in the afternoon, 40.59% and 22.45% in the evening, and finally ending the day with 31.65% and 25.50% during the night screenings.
While Chhaava’s collections had been declining in the past few days, the movie is expected to pass the Rs 550 crore mark this weekend. It’s currently trailing Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s Animal (Rs 553.87 crore) which sits in the eighth position. Chhaava will likely surpass Animal’s haul this weekend, as it aims for to maximise its potential before the arrival of Salman Khan’s Sikandar. Globally, Chhaava will pass the Rs 750 crore mark this weekend.

Title: Mosque gate ‘rammed’, slogans raised in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri during celebrations on Holi eve
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mosque-gate-rammed-maharashtra-ratnagiri-holi-9887104/
Content:
Police in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri district have booked several youth after the gates of a mosque were allegedly rammed multiple times during a traditional celebration on the eve of Holi.
The alleged incident took place in Rajapur village, nearly 400 kms south of Mumbai, during the Shimga festival, or Madachi miravnuk, a Konkani ritual that involves carrying a tree trunk to the Dhopeshwar temple.
Locals alleged that on Thursday, the group carrying the tree trunk to the temple rammed it into the mosque gate several times while raising provocative slogans. Several videos of the alleged incident were also circulated on social media, with some captions alleging the group was trying to force their way into the mosque.
A local resident, asking not to be named, said: “…While the miravnuk (procession) is an old custom in Konkan (region), but this time around we were shocked that they rammed the trunk into the gate. The gate was then locked, but they rammed the trunk again. Some people were also raising aggressive slogans which vitiated the atmosphere.”
Ratnagiri SP Dhananjay Kulkarni said, “Some youngsters in front of the procession, who were under the influence of alcohol, behaved aggressively and chanted slogans outside the mosque. We have registered an FIR against them under Section 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act as they defied prohibitory orders issued by the administration.”
SP Kulkarni said the incident “prima facie does not appear to be planned”. “Actually there was a large crowd and due to the momentum from the back, the trunk was propelled forwards,” he said.
Another officer, who did not wish to be named, said: “Some elements used these videos with misleading captions trying to create communal discord. Our team tracked down a Worli-based person who had uploaded such a video and made him delete it. We are deciding if any legal action should be taken against him.”

Title: Mickey Arthur: ‘I felt desperately sorry for Gary Kirsten and Jason Gillespie’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mickey-arthur-i-felt-desperately-sorry-for-gary-kirsten-and-jason-gillespie-9886014/
Content:
Mickey Arthur has made a scathing attack on the Pakistan cricket, called it a “jungle,” which is run by “agenda driven people.” Arthur, who coached Pakistan to the 2017 Champions Trophy title has lambasted Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the way they treated Gary Kirsten and Jason Gillespie.
Gillespie and Kirsten were appointed to their respective positions in April 2024 but both resigned and were replaced by Aaqib before the end of the year.
Pakistan crashed out of the Champions Trophy in the group stage without a win. Pakistan coach Aaqib Javed has said:  “We changed 16 coaches in the last two-and-a-half years and 26 selectors. If you do this to any team in the world, their performance would be the same.”
Taking it on the social media, former Pakistan Test head coach Jason Gillespie has called his successor Aaqib Javed “a clown” and accused him of undermining him and former white-ball coach Gary Kirsten in order to take over their roles.
Former England fast bowler Steve Harminson has asked Arthur about the whole scenario on TalkSports.
Arthur replied: “I love those quotes, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie, he is a wonderful coach, he is a wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its own worst enemy.”
“There are so many good players, they have got the resources now, there is so much young talent, they have an incredible skill and yet everything is just still so chaotic.
“It is really disappointing to see. When they had signed Gillespie and Kirsten, they had gone down exactly the right route. They had got some really good players because ultimately it is the players that lose out.
“I thought they had signed some very good coaches who were going to take them forward. But then that machine just works in Pakistan, it just keeps undermining. There are agendas driven in the media, it is a jungle out there sometimes.
“I felt desperately sorry for Gary and Jason. There is no doubt in my mind, I think they were undermined. That is very disappointing because it is to the detriment of the players and ultimately to the detriment of Pakistan cricket.”

Title: WPL Eliminator: Mumbai Indians’ batting firepower takes them to the final; sloppy Gujarat Giants pay the price for mistakes
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-eliminator-mumbai-indians-batting-firepower-sloppy-gujarat-giants-9885705/
Content:
Plenty happened at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai even before a ball was bowled on Friday in the Women’s Premier League Eliminator. Minutes before the toss, Gujarat Giants’ star allrounder Deandra Dottin – who has bowled the pressure overs with the ball and had been playing impactful cameos with the bat – was ruled out due to a knee injury. At the toss, GG captain Gujarat Giants called it right but then had to make the tricky call. Throughout the tournament, teams have opted to bowl first but the matches in Mumbai so far saw teams winning after batting first.
She went with the overall trend. Later in the night, Mumbai Indians captain Harmanpreet Kaur would reveal that her personal choice was to bat first but the team’s collective choice was to bowl.
It worked out well in the end, she chuckled as MI beat GG by 47 runs in the knockout match to seal their entry into the final and set up a rematch of the 2023 title clash against Delhi Capitals. Gardner’s decision to bowl first might not have been the worst of calls, given the amount of dew that came in later but their efforts in the field didn’t help. GG ended the tournament as they started, ruing plenty of missed opportunities on the field as Nat Sciver-Brunt, Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur made merry to power MI to 213/4. That GG still ended up being only 47 short despite their star batters not firing was a mark of how below par their performance in the first half was. The result was Mumbai Indians’ seventh straight win over the Giants in WPL history.
“Once we knew we had qualified, everyone was thrilled, as they should be. There are many positives to take from this, but today it wasn’t to be, we fell short. We didn’t excel in all three facets of the game, we missed opportunities. With the ball and then with the bat, we were just a bit short. It’s a disappointing day,” Gardner said later.
MI, who have had issues at the top of the order, reverted to opening with Yastika Bhatia but her struggles this season continued. But after a rather sedate powerplay, Sciver-Brunt (77 off 41) and Matthews (77 off 50) displayed plenty of class in 71-ball 133 partnership. And against her favourite opponent, Harmanpreet (36 off 12) provided the finishing touches with a crisp cameo striking at 300.00.
Debutant Daniell Gibson (34 off 24) and Phoebe Litchfield (31 off 20) looked in threatening touch but regular fall of wickets kept pegging the Giants back. The highlight of Litchfield’s effort was the switch hit of Matthews.
Gardner, who bailed her team out on multiple occasions during the season, had an off day with the bat. Indian batter Bharti Fulmali delayed the inevitable with an impressive 30 off 20 balls.
Earlier Sciver-Brunt, who forms the backbone of Mumbai Indians batting, disdainfully smashed pacers and spinners, collecting 10 fours and two sixes in the process. Realising Mumbai had got only 37 in the powerplay, Matthews and Sciver-Brunt changed gears. While the England batter took the attack to debutant pacer Danielle Gibson, Matthews hammered three consecutive boundaries off leg-spinner Priya Mishra.
Matthews, who began cautiously before cutting loose, got to her fifty with a six off a long hop from left-arm spinner Tanuja Kanwer. In the death overs, it was raining sixes from the bat of Harmanpreet who cleared the ropes four times in her sizzling effort. MI smashed 73 in the last five overs.
It didn’t help the Giants that they were on self-destructing mode in the chase with three run-outs. Their innings ended at 166 all out in 19.2 overs with Matthews also chipping in with the ball, striking twice. “I tried to control just one side of the field, varied my pace. That is something we have been working on. We were in their step-hit zone quite a bit when we played them last time,” Matthews said about her bowling. She was named the player of the match.

Title: Mitchell Starc says KL Rahul is Indian cricket team’s Mr Fix It; pays rich compliment to Indian cricket’s depth
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mitchell-starc-kl-rahul-indian-cricket-mr-fix-it-rich-praise-depth-9885528/
Content:
Australian pacer Mitchell Starc, who opted out of playing at the recent Champions Trophy, has heaped rich praise on Indian cricket and its depth. He has also lauded middle-order batter KL Rahul as the Indian cricket team’s ‘Mr Fix It’ in a recent interview.
“KL Rahul is like Mr. Fix It for India. He has opened the batting when asked to, batted at Number 6, kept wickets, fielded, batted in middle order — he has done just about everything, he has played vital roles, excited to play alongside him,” said Starc on the Fanatics TV YouTube channel.
Starc went on to praise Rahul as a gentleman. Another Australian cricketer Moises Henriques, who was also part of the interview, agreed with Starc and lauded Rahul for his kindness.
While talking about the depth in Indian team’s ranks, Starc said in the interview: “The depth in Indian cricket… India are probably the only nation in the world that could have a Test team, an ODI team and a T20I team play on the same day. They could maybe be playing against Australia in the Tests, England in the ODIs and South Africa in the T20. And India would be competitive! Not other country could do that.”
Starc was asked in the interview if Indian players were gaining an edge from consistently playing high-intensity games in the Indian Premier League.
Starc pointed out the disadvantage for Indians. “Not sure Indians have an advantage. Because the rest of us have opportunities to play  franchise cricket all around the world, but the Indian guys can only play in the IPL. Sure it’s the number 1 product (in franchise cricket). IPL’s top notch and for 8-10 weeks you have high-class cricket, you get games every few days as a player. But I don’t think you can sit on that. Because there are guys who play for four or five different franchise leagues a year, so they’re still getting exposure to white ball cricket.”

Title: ‘India won Champions Trophy fair and square’: Mitchell Starc on Men in Blue gaining edge by staying in Dubai
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-won-champions-trophy-fair-and-square-mitchell-starc-9885458/
Content:
Ever since the Indian cricket team won the Champions Trophy title by defeating New Zealand in Dubai, there has been some murmurs about Rohit Sharma and his men gaining an advantage from playing all their games at the same venue while the rest of the seven teams had to travel around. The second finalist, New Zealand, in particular had to fly from Pakistan to Dubai to face India in a group stage clash, then fly back to Pakistan for the semis. And then fly back to Dubai for the final.
Others have also lamented the advantage that India gained by their familiarity with the same pitch.
But Australian pacer Mitchell Starc, who opted out of playing at the Champions Trophy, has backed the Men in Blue, stating that they won the title ‘fair and square’. He did concede that India had an advantage from playing exclusively  in Dubai.
“When one team gets to stay at one place, no flights, no restrictions upon them in the place, train at the same venue every time, play every game at the same venue, I would tend to agree with some of the opinions that have come out. I can understand where a lot of the guys in the other seven teams were coming from and some opinions from broadcasters,” Starc said on FanaticsTV’s YouTube channel in an interview.
“There’s been a lot made on that topic. Obviously, India tried to push that to the side and say it’s a neutral venue, but there’s been a lot to come out of the tournament during and post-tournament. India won fair and square, they were the better team, they are a bloody good cricket team, and have been across all formats for a long time,” Australian pacer Starc said in the interview released on Wednesday.

Title: I think my friend Abid Ali was a grossly underestimated cricketer: Farokh Engineer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-think-my-friend-abid-ali-was-a-grossly-underestimated-cricketer-farokh-engineer-9885492/
Content:
Former India keeper-batter Farokh Engineer on Thursday paid rich tributes to his teammate Syed Abid Ali and said he was a “grossly underestimated cricketer” despite his versatility and ability to take catches with great dexterity at close-in fielding positions.
The India all-rounder of yesteryear died on Wednesday after a prolonged illness, leaving his well-wishers, acquaintances and friends, including Engineer, sad. He was 83.
“My friend Abid Ali, rest in peace. I just can’t believe it. You know, one be one, people are sadly, sadly passing away. Abid was a real dear friend, a contemporary of mine, my colleague, my roommate at one time also, a wonderful person, a wonderful cricketer, very talented all-rounder,” Engineer said.
Abid Ali was part of an illustrious group of Hyderabad cricketers that included MAK Pataudi, ML Jaisimha, and Abbas Ali Baig. He died in the United States.
The news of Abid Ali’s passing was shared by the North America Cricket League.
Engineer said “He gave 100 percent to his team every time he played for India, and I think he was a grossly underestimated cricketer because people don’t realise how good a close-in fielder was, you know he was overshadowed a bit by Solkar.
“But Solkar on one side and Abid Ali on the other side made the spinning quartet (of Bedi, Prasanna, Chandrasekhar and Venkataraghavan) even more dangerous, of course with the wicketkeeper behind.” “Coming back to my dear friend Abid, he will be sadly missed. We don’t know what was wrong with him — was he ailing for a while or what? But I sent my sincerest condolences to my family in America, in Hyderabad, or wherever they may be.
“He was a great man, a great cricketer, and a great friend indeed. A sad loss for India and for Indian cricket,” Engineer, 87, added from his home in the UK.
Abid Ali made his Test debut in December 1967 against Australia in Adelaide, marking the occasion with a sensational 6/55 in the first innings — his career-best bowling figures.
His batting prowess was on display later in the same series when he scored 78 and 81 in the Sydney Test, proving his all-round capabilities.
Between 1967 and 1974, he played 29 Tests for India, tallying 1,018 runs and taking 47 wickets.
He was ahead of his time and was known for his work ethic.
Abid Ali was lightning-quick while running between the wickets and was one of the finest fielders of his time.

Title: Yuzvendra Chahal returns to Northamptonshire for second spell
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/yuzvendra-chahal-returns-to-northamptonshire-for-second-spell-9885416/
Content:
Indian wrist spinner Yuzvendra Chahal will return to Northamptonshire from June till the end of the season. The 34-year-old played for the team in 2024. He will be available for the County Championship from June and the One Day Cup later in the English summer. “I thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season so I’m very happy to be coming back,” Chahal said. “There are some great people in that dressing room, and I can’t wait to be part of that again.”
“We played some great cricket towards the back end of the season so hopefully we’re able to replicate that and big up some victories,” Chahal would add. The leg-spinner has picked up 9/99 against Derbyshire last season. Additionally, he also managed to scalp a five-wicket haul against Kent in the One Day Cup.
Chahal also has done remarkable things in the Indian colors. In 72 ODIs, Chahal has picked up 121 wickets at an average of 27.13 and an economy of 5.27. In T20Is, he is the second-highest wicket-taker for India with 96 wickets. He is regarded highly by many former and current players.
“I’m really excited that one of best leg spinners in the world is returning to Northamptonshire this season,” team’s coach Darren Lehmann would say. “He brings invaluable experience and he’s an absolute gentleman who loves the game. Having him available from mid-June until the end of the season will be fantastic for us,” he would add.
“Chahal is quite old school and orthodox in terms of his leg-spin,” former India left-arm spinner Murali Kartik told The Indian Express. “He is not a Ravi Bishnoi or Rashid Khan who are not big spinners of the ball. He has the leg-spin, googly and the top spinner. In addition, when he is bowling well and gets enough revolutions on the ball, he gets a lot of drift or swirl towards the right-hander or away from the left-hander. All these things are tricks up his sleeve.”

Title: All Pakistan players snubbed in The Hundred draft; James Anderson, Andrew Flintoff’s son too find no takers
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-players-snubbed-the-hundred-draft-james-anderson-no-takers-9885138/
Content:
Imad Wasim, Hassan Ali, Saud Shakeel, Salman Ali Agha, Naseem Shah and Mohammad Amir were among the 45 Pakistan cricketers who enlisted their names for the draft of The Hundred and were snubbed by all the eight franchises on Wednesday. Five female Pakistan cricketers also found no takers in the women’s draft on Wednesday.
The Hundred’s draft saw 270 domestic and 350 overseas cricketers throw their hats in the ring to be picked for the upcoming season, which starts on August 5. It must be noted that the eight teams are still able to add two more players to their squads in May’s wildcard draft.
One of the reasons for this snub was that each of the franchise was able to add only limited overseas players in the draft in their ranks.
The snub comes after Indian owners bought stakes in four of the eight teams. Mumbai Indians have a stake worth Rs 650 crore in Oval Invincibles, Sanjeev Goenka of Lucknow SuperGiants is a majority owner of Manchester Originals (with a stake of Rs 885 crore), IT magnet Sanjay Govil has invested about Rs 437 crore in Welsh Fire and the Sun Group, which owns IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad, has a significant stake in the Northern Superchargers franchise for about Rs 1,093 crore.
Besides this, Indian origin owners also have invested in the other four franchises.
It must be noted that all the six teams in South Africa’s SA20 league are co-owned by IPL franchises. Consequently, none of them pick up Pakistani players.
Earlier, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould had tried to allay fears that Indian owners coming on board would affect Pakistan players getting picked in teams.
“We’re aware of that (Pakistani players being snubbed in franchise leagues) in other regions,” Gould was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo. “But that won’t be happening here.”
Also ignored in the draft were England pace legend James Anderson and Rocky Flintoff, the 16-year-old son of former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff.
Anderson will turn 43 during the 2025 edition of The Hundred. He does have a one-year deal with Lancashire to play in County Championship. However, he was also snubbed by the IPL in the auction.

Title: IPL 2025: Harry Brook banned from Indian Premier League for two years as per new BCCI rules
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2025-harry-brook-banned-from-indian-premier-league-for-two-years-as-per-new-bcci-rules-9885267/
Content:
England batter Harry Brook has been banned from the Indian Premier League for the next two years, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has informed England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). As per the board’s new policy, Brook cannot enter auction for two more years, as he has decided to skip this IPL season at the last moment.
“An official communication has been sent to ECB and Brook about BCCI banning him for two years as per its policy which was informed to each player before they registered their name for IPL auction last year. It’s a policy set by the board and each player has to oblige to it,” a BCCI official confirmed to The Indian Express.
According to a new rule introduced by the IPL, “Any player who registers in the auction and after getting picked, makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for 2 seasons.”
Brook has pulled out of the IPL for the second season running, citing the need to prepare for his commitments with the national team. He was bought by Delhi Capitals for Rs 6.25 Crore in the mega auction in November. In the previous auction too, he was secured by Delhi for Rs 4 crore.
“I have made the very difficult decision to pull out of the upcoming IPL,” Brook had said in a statement. “I apologise unreservedly to the Delhi Capitals and their supporters.”
“I love cricket. Ever since I was a young boy, I have dreamt of playing for my country, and I am extremely thankful to have the opportunity to play the game I love at this level. With the guidance of people I trust, I have taken the time to seriously consider this decision. It is a really important time for England cricket, and I want to fully commit to preparing for the upcoming series. In order to do this, I need time to recharge after the busiest period in my career to date.
“I know not everyone will understand, and I don’t expect them to, but I have to do what I believe is right, and playing for my country remains my priority and focus. I remain hugely grateful for the opportunities I have been given and the support I receive.”
Brook’s decision might not sit well with the Delhi Capitals, who had re-signed him after he pulled out last year, following the death of his grandmother. IPL is scheduled to kick start from March 22 when defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders will meet Royal Challengers Bangalore at Eden Gardens.

Title: Under-fire PCB revises match fees of players in National T20 Championship
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/under-fire-pcb-revises-match-fees-of-players-in-national-t20-championship-9885211/
Content:
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday increased the players’ match fee for the National T20 Championship after its decision to enforce a pay cut faced severe backlash.
The PCB had earlier reduced the match fees to Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000 for players and reserves, forcing its chairman Mohsin Naqvi to issue orders to review the decision.
Finding itself in a corner after widespread criticism, PCB has now increased the match fees of players to Rs 40,000 and reserves to Rs 20,000.
Pakistan’s domestic cricket schedule and structure has been under discussion this season after the board abruptly stopped the National Under-19 Championship after just one day’s play.
The decision to reduce the match fees was earlier taken on the orders of Naqvi after complaints of selection of over-age players and other issues.
Interestingly, the National junior event, which is seen as the best platform for new talent, has still not been held this season.
There have also been reports of the domestic department cutting facilities for players in domestic cricket like termination of contracts and lowering hotel and travelling standards.
PCB sources claim that the expense cuts have been executed because of the increased domestic cricket events this season which were earlier not included in the budget.

Title: ‘He was a better and bigger performer’: Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Akhtar compare Hardik Pandya to Abdul Razzaq

Content:
Former Pakistan cricketers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Hafeez would compare Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya to another ex-Pakistan player Abdul Razzaq and both would agree that Razzaq was a better player than Hardik. However, Hafeez would also concede that Pakistan cricket should have taken more care of Razzaq and also the player himself should have responded more.
“I would agree with him. You take out the details of Abdul Razzaq’s performances. He was a better and bigger performer. But the system didn’t look after him and the player also didn’t respond that much. He was limited in his skills and didn’t try to outdo his own potential. Whatever I’ve seen of Razzaq, he was better than this version of Hardik,” Hafeez said speaking on ‘Game on Hai.’
“Hardik is no Marshall, Waqar, Lee or Srinath. It’s just his mindset. You throw him the new ball, he does it. You ask him in to bowl in the middle, he does it. However, he is not that powerful hitter also. He had given that belief that the world is your stage. The market allows you to become big,” Akhtar would say. “This type of hitting used to be a norm in the Pakistan team He’s really good, but this was the norm in Pakistan’s team he would recall.
Speaking of how versatile Razzaq was Akhtar would say, “He was asked to open, played in the middle order and sometimes even lower order. He has done everything but he didn’t get the respect until he won a match against South Africa single-handedly. I was at the other end. I defended a full toss and he said ‘don’t lift your bat’. I said I won’t. He was hitting the ball so hard that day that I thought if the ball came towards me, it would go through me. But we didn’t give him the respect, and neither did we give Azhar Mahmood the respect that he deserved. He was a great performer with the ball,”

Title: Shahid Afridi was the main person telling me to convert: Danish Kaneria

Content:
Former Pakistan cricketer Danish Kaneria claimed that Shahid Afridi had asked him to convert many times during his playing days. The 44-year-old speaking on the sidelines of a congressional briefing on the plight of minorities in Pakistan in Washington DC opened up about it.
“We all gathered here and shared our experiences of how we were treated in Pakistan. We have faced discrimination, and today, we raised our voices against it,” Kaneria was quoted by ANI. Shahid Afridi was the main person telling me to convert, and he did a lot of times. Inzamam-ul-Haq never used to talk that way,”
“I, too, have faced a lot of discrimination, and my career was destroyed. I did not receive the respect and equal value I deserved in Pakistan. Because of this discrimination, I am in the US today. We spoke to raise awareness and let the USA know how much we have suffered so that action can be taken,” Kaneria added.
Earlier an interview with Aaj Tak Kaneria would also shed some positive light on Inzamam-ul-Haq. Kaneria would reveal that Inazamam was the only captain who had supported and backed him.
“I was doing well in my career and was playing county cricket too. Inzamam-ul-Haq supported me a lot and was the only captain who did so. Alongside him, Shoaib Akhtar. Shahid Afridi and many other Pakistan players troubled me a lot and didn’t eat with me,” Kaneria said.
The leg-spinner played 61 Test matches for Pakistan picking up 261 wickets at an average economy rate of 3.07 in red-ball cricket. However, in 2012 Kaneria was proven guilty of spot-fixing by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and was slapped life ban for it.

Title: No one is ready to sit out the IPL…Conditions will shift from the North Pole to the South Pole: Navjot Singh Sidhu on India’s upcoming tour of England

Content:
India will face England in June later this year for the five-match Test series. However, before going into the marquee series most of the Indian players have to endure about 10 weeks of T20 cricket in the form of the Indian Premier League. The conditions the Indian players will experience for the IPL in India and the for the England tour will be polar opposites said former Indian cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu.
“The thing to be worried about is that the IPL is now coming up next. No one is ready to sit out the IPL. They will play the league and then all of a sudden comes the England tour. Conditions will shift from the North Pole to the South Pole. Completely different,” said Sidhu
“Moreover, India’s last Test series in England had started on August 4. This time, it is ending on August 2. The matches are in June and July. There will be grass and moisture and the air will be so heavy that the ball will gain ample movement. And then it will move more off the seam,” Sidhu added.
The last time India toured England in 2021/2022 the series ended up 2-2.
The wrist-spinner Varun Chakarvarthy has been going through a purple patch in his career. However, Sidhu predicts that there are issues in the Indian side especially when it comes to playing all-rounders in overseas conditions. Though he feels Chakarvarthy might add value he expected India not to expose him.
“India’s biggest problem is that in the middle order there are no all-rounders the way you see in white ball cricket. Is there a Ravindra Jadeja, or Hardik Pandya or Axar Patel? There is only Jadeja among these three and even he will be limited there. Will he take 4-5 wickets in an innings there? No. You will have to bring a mystery spinner with all of them, that is England’s weakness. But India won’t expose Varun Chakravarthy.”

Indian star batter Ishan Kishan, after some good performances in the Indian colour in all the formats, has slowly disappeared from the scene. The star batter was also released from the Mumbai Indians ahead of the Mega Auction and was brought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for the upcoming Indian Premier League season 2025. Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra predicts it is the “biggest opportunity” for Kishan.
“The biggest opportunity is for Ishan Kishan. For whatever reason, he has just completely disappeared from the radar. It seems like no one is talking about him or understanding his importance. He even went and played the Ranji Trophy, and scored runs there, he is doing everything, but no one is even talking about him,” Chopra said on his YouTube channel.
Kishan was dropped in the following game after scoring a double in the ODI format against Bangladesh. “He has got an ODI double-century. How many people have scored a double century in ODIs, and this guy has done that? This guy can hit sixes and change gears and bat,” Chopra would recall.
SRH though has established openers in Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head who performed well last season and went on to buy Ishan Kishan in an auction for 11.25 crores who has been successful for his previous franchise Mumbai Indians at the top of the order. Though Kishan has batted in the middle order it will be interesting to see how the Hyderabad-based franchise in the upcoming season.
Sunrisers Hyderabad IPL 2025 squad: Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Heinrich Klassen, Nitish Reddy, Ishan Kishan, Mohammad Shami, Harshal Patel, Rahul Chahar, Adam Zampa, Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Kamindu Mendis, Aniket Verma, Eshan Malinga, Sachin Baby, Pat Cummins; Wiaan Mulder for Brydon Carse.

Title: ‘Rohit Sharma has got no reason to retire’: AB de Villiers backs India captain to continue
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-no-reason-retire-odi-record-ab-de-villiers-9884291/
Content:
Only days after Rohit Sharma quashed rumours of quitting international cricket after winning the Champions Trophy, the Indian captain has found huge backing to continue from South Africa batting legend, AB de Villiers.
de Villiers hailed Rohit’s supreme record as a batter and captain and appreciated the India opener for rewiring his batting in the ODI format over the last three years. The Champions Trophy triumph only nine months after lifting the T20 World Cup made Rohit only the second Indian skipper after MS Dhoni to win multiple ICC titles.
“Compared to other captains, look at Rohit’s win percentage, it’s almost 74%, which is substantially more than any other captain of the past. If he keeps going, he will go down as one of the best ODI captains of all time. Rohit has also said he is not retiring and has requested that rumours be stopped spreading.
Rohit led India’s tricky 252-run chase in the final against New Zealand in Dubai, charging with a brutal onslaught in the Powerplay. The 37-year-old was adjudged the player of the final, scoring 76 off 83 balls.
“Why would he retire? With that kind of record not only as captain but also as a batter. That 76 in the final, giving India a fantastic start, laying the foundation for success and leading from the front when the pressure was at its peak,” de Villiers remarked on his YouTube channel.
“Rohit Sharma has got no reason to retire. No reason to take any criticism whatsoever. His record speaks for himself. Not only that, but he has also sort of transformed his game. If we have a look at his strike rate in the Powerplay it was quite low for an opening batter in the Powerplay but since 2022 his strike rate has rose to 115 in the first powerplay and that’s the difference between good and great. It’s transforming your own game and it never stops. You have always something to learn and something to do better,” he added.

Title: Former Australia spinner Stuart Macgill found guilty of drug deal set-up
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/former-australia-spinner-stuart-macgill-found-guilty-drug-deal-9884088/
Content:
Former Australia spinner Stuart Macgill was on Thursday found guilty of facilitating a drug deal between his partner’s brother and a dealer after a jury rejected his claim of only introducing the pair. While Macgill was acquitted of a charge on supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, the jury’s verdict came after an eight-day trial in the New South Wales District Court.
According to 7news, the 54-year-old Macgill had been accused of facilitating a cocaine deal between his partner’s brother, Marino Sotiropoulos, and a dealer (who was not named for legal reasons) called Person A.
It is reported that Macgill was the link for a $330,000 exchange for a kilogram of cocaine between his brother-in-law, Marino Sotiropoulos, and his regular drug dealer. The cricketer arranged for a meeting under his restaurant on Sydney’s north shore. However, the former Test leg-spinner denied knowing that a deal would take place and admitted that he regularly purchased half a gram of cocaine for $200 from the dealer.
While prosecutors quashed Macgill’s claim, stating that the deal in April 2021 could not have taken place without his involvement, the jury acquitted Macgill of being involved in the one-kilogram deal and proceeded to deem him guilty in a lesser charge of participating in the supply. It is reported that Macgill’s sentencing hearing has been adjourned for eight weeks.
In a career overshadowed by spin legend Shane Warne, Macgill represented Australia in 44 Tests between 1998 and 2008, claiming 208 wickets.

Title: How Rohit Sharma used his spinners as the trump card in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-rohit-sharma-used-spin-india-champions-trophy-jadeja-axar-varun-kuldeep-9884012/
Content:
In the final hour of New Zealand’s innings on Sunday, Rohit Sharma had the opportunity to hammer the spin nail down fully on the opposition to the last possible inch. An Axar Patel injury situation towards the end of the middle overs meant the Indian skipper had to factor in a couple of extra overs from the wobbly pace grid of Shami and Hardik Pandya at the death on the day. Though the left-arm spinner bowled another, Rohit held back Axar’s last two overs, perhaps because he had to play a crucial role with the bat at No. 5 too.
The death overs yielded 79 runs, 58 of which came from five overs of pace. Despite the dawdle against spin for the majority of the innings, New Zealand had about enough to salvage a fight. Rohit’s marginal miss on a 40/40 of spin could have reared its head on another night, but not on Sunday when his pack of spinners had scythed the fight down comprehensively within the first 40 overs.
Between the 28 overs of spin from Axar, Ravindra Jadeja and Varun Chakaravarthy between overs 6-45, New Zealand mustered three fours while hesitantly gulping down 15 overs worth of dot balls. Kuldeep Yadav, the fourth, leaked two fours and a six. However, the left-arm wrist-spinner’s consolation came gift-wrapped in the form of New Zealand’s two heavyweight bats. After Kuldeep snared Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson in successive overs between 11 and 13, the Indian advantage was established on Dubai’s Champions Trophy final strip.
The 228 deliveries off the slower bowlers were a 14-year high for India, bettering the 225 Rohit commanded from his tweakers against the same opposition in the league stage the previous week.
Shunning out all the outside noise that initially rubbished the idea of four spinners in the XI, the management had a near-perfect captain in Rohit to execute the moves on the field. Early in his interim days as skipper of the ODI side, Rohit had struck gold with a similar move in the 2018 Asia Cup in the UAE, deploying more than 30 overs thrice within a week to lift the title.
In four front-line spin proponents, Rohit and India developed an unmissable but befuddling second code to Jasprit Bumrah in the format. Banking on the strengths of Axar, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav in spotlessly cleaning up the middle-overs, India drafted the secret sauce with Chakaravarthy and tapped it in judicious quantum to destroy and leave space for more havoc.
During the first two games against Bangladesh and Pakistan where India banked on nearly as many overs of pace as spin, they witnessed two spells of sustained wicket-less phases that evolved into century partnerships. A spin overhaul with the addition of Chakaravarthy over seamer Harshit Rana meant sharper attacks in every phase in heavier matches against New Zealand (in the league stage and final) and Australia in the semifinal.
Despite conceding five fifty-plus stands in the last three games, India ensured they were nipped earlier than before with a relentless spin shuffle. Teams were rendered almost powerless against this invincibly accurate quartet that not only jotted 506 dot balls (51.47 per cent) off all deliveries (981) bowled by them but also snapped up 60 per cent (26 of 43) of wickets taken by the Indian bowlers.
While Rohit employed a recurring pattern in utilising his arsenal, neither New Zealand nor Australia could thwart the four-layered spin code that seemed so smooth in their simultaneous orbits in the last week of the tournament.
Suction pumps
Left-arm finger spinners Axar and Jadeja predominantly operated within the first 40, snipping through larger spells with a focus on inducing pressure with a layer of dot balls. While Axar had straight bursts of seven and eight overs in the league-stage wins over Pakistan and New Zealand, the veteran Jadeja was in his element in the knockouts. After bowling a straight eight-over spell in the semi-final against Australia conceding only 40, Jadeja constricted the Kiwis in the final with a marathon nine overs in succession between overs 20-36, conceding only 26 for a wicket.
The Axar-Jadeja combine had a staggeringly identical effect on the defensive set-up of Rohit’s spin spread, picking up five wickets each at an economy of 4.35 in the tournament.
The death alternate
Of the few glaring errors Rohit committed on the field was Kuldeep’s Powerplay induction in the semi-final against Australia to take on Travis Head. After carrying the load of nearly bowling half his quota at the death until then, Kuldeep had to be taken off the attack after being smoked by Head for a six in the eighth over of the semifinal. Though the 30-year-old was back in his element in the final, churning out the two prized scalps, Kuldeep was largely entrusted with manning the death overs alongside Mohammed Shami in the tournament. The wily wrist-spinner sent down more deliveries than Shami, claiming four wickets at a 5.18 economy at the death.
Despite bowling the most overs (46.3) among the Indians with a pronounced share coming in the second half of the innings, Kuldeep’s 4.79 economy stood well within sight of the miserly orthodox tweakers.
Magic wheel
While a shrewd Chakaravarthy wouldn’t let go of his sorcery in the nets, Rohit wouldn’t allow the opposition to have a proper whiff of the Tamil Nadu spinner either. Save for his first five-over spell on initiation in India’s last league stage match against New Zealand, Rohit did not use the mystery man for more than three overs in any spell.
The Chakaravarthy wave still lingered in every form and phase across 50 overs. Of the four Powerplay overs he bowled in three games, Chakaravarthy made two massive inroads for India in times of trouble. After dismissing Head in the semifinal in his first over in the ninth, Chakaravarthy put the brakes on a promising New Zealand’s 57-run opening stand in the final when he removed Will Young in the eighth over. Used adeptly by Rohit in clever two-three over stints, Chakaravarthy also doubled up on Kuldeep’s effectiveness at the death to draw a perfect Bumrah parallel in the decisive games – fishing out three wickets at 4.85 rpo.
Mapping all four of them together under the captain’s nous formed India’s impregnable bowling unit for the Dubai gauntlet. It is unclear if a spin-bowling model of such offensive and defensive characters would load up India’s ODI attack again. But if it hasn’t been established already, Rohit and his spin cartel’s effective coherence could soon rub off on the T20I team’s World Cup defence next year.

Title: Bangladesh’s Mahmudullah announces retirement from international cricket
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mahmudullah-retirement-international-cricket-bangladesh-9883453/
Content:
Bangladesh allrounder Mahmudullah Riyad on Wednesday announced his retirement from international cricket. The 39-year-old had already retired from Tests in 2021 and then ended his T20I career in October 2024. His last tournament for Bangladesh was the recently-concluded Champions Trophy where the Bangla Tigers were eliminated from the group stage.
“All praises only for the Almighty Allah. I have decided to retire from international cricket. I would like to thank all of my teammates, coaches & specially my fans who has always supported me,” he posted on Facebook.
“A big thank you to my parents, my in laws specially my father in law & most importantly my brother Emdad Ullah who has been there  for me constantly since my childhood as my coach & mentor. And finally thanks to my wife & kids who have been my support system through thick & thin. Not everything comes to an end in a perfect way but you say yes & move forward. Best wishes to my team & Bangladesh cricket,” he further said in the post.

Mahmudullah had a below-par Champions Trophy campaign scoring just 4 runs in one match which he played against New Zealand, with the player sitting out the opening match against India and then the match against Pakistan was washed out.
The player has scored 5689 runs from 239 matches in ODIs and has 4 centuries and 32 fifties. With the ball, he has notched up 82 wickets in the format. He is also the fourth-highest run-scorer for Bangladesh in ODIs, behind Tamim Iqbal (8357), Mushfiqur Rahim (7795), and Shakib Al Hasan (7570).

He also has four centuries in major ICC events with 3 in World Cups and 1 in 2017 Champions Trophy, which is the most by any Bangladesh player. The veteran was also Bangladesh’s leading run-scorer in the 2023 Men’s World Cup in India with 328 runs.

Title: ‘We are not able to defeat D teams who come to our country playing with our full teams’: Kamran Akmal slams Pakistan cricket unit

Content:
Pakistan has hosted an ICC event after 29 years. However, the side could not deliver the performance and was eliminated from the tournament just after playing a couple of games. Former Pakistan cricketer Kamran Akmal would lambast the Pakistan side for their performances through the tournament and would say they could not defeat even the D teams with their full strength.
“We are not able to defeat D teams who come to our country playing with our full teams. You are good and get respect only when your team plays well and wins,” Akmal said on his YouTube channel.
The tournament was held in hybrid model due to political tensions between India and Pakistan hence India played all their games in Dubai. The Men in Blue reaching the final meant that the final would be held in Dubai however, after India winning the trophy there was no offical representation from Pakistan cricket at the trophy presentation ceremony.
“It was shameful in the ceremony. We are not capable of this because our aim was to host the event and we did it and it was successful but with that you also earn respect by playing good cricket. We have finished eighth and that is why we are being made fun of. In the ceremony no one discussed about Pakistan and how good the tournament was hosted in Pakistan,” Akmal said.
“The final of the Champions Trophy is done but we have been shown the mirror by ICC and by world cricket the way we played and the way we had no representation in the ceremony. The chairman was not there and not well but the tournament director was there, he could have come for the ceremony. Why did he not come? He did not come because we did not deserve it. They way we have played, our performance has been poor for last 5-6 years,” he added.

Title: Lord’s expected to lose nearly 4 million pounds in revenue after India fail to qualify for WTC final: Report
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/lords-4-million-pounds-loss-india-failure-to-qualify-wtc-final-9883011/
Content:
With India failing to qualify for the World Test Championship final, host Lord’s is expected to lose nearly 4 million pounds in revenue, according to a report by The Times. The final will be played between Australia and South Africa from June 11 to 15 of this year.
India, who were runners up in the last 2 finals against New Zealand and Australia respectively, could not punch their tickets for their third consecutive summit clash after they lost 0-3 to New Zealand at home and then went down 3-1 to Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy.
South Africa would top the WTC table while Australia would come second. India would ebnd up finishing third in the points table followed by New Zealand, Sri Lanka, England, Bangladesh, West Indies and Pakistan.
“Lord’s is set to generate nearly £4million less in revenue for the upcoming ICC World Test Championship final after India’s failure to qualify,” The Times report said.
“…the absence of India has significantly curtailed the financial windfall expected by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), underscoring the financial influence of Indian cricket across the global game,” it added.
The Marylebone Cricket Club had originally set premium ticket prices for the final, anticipating India’s participation which would lead to a surge in ticket sales but once it became clear that India would not qualify, the MCC reduced the prices.
“The decision to be flexible with prices for the World Test Championship final was taken this year, with tickets now being sold at between £40 and £90 — about £50 cheaper than they had originally been priced, accounting for the loss in revenue,” the report said.

The MCC had faced criticism last year during England’s Test series against Sri Lanka, when only 9,000 spectators attended the fourth day of the match, prompting them to reconsider their pricing strategy for this event.

Title: Former Indian cricketer Syed Abid Ali passes away at age 83
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/former-indian-cricketer-syed-abid-ali-passes-away-at-age-83-9882998/
Content:
Former Indian all-rounder Syed Abid Ali passed away at the age of 83 years on Wednesday in the United States. Abid has played 29 Test matches for India and has picked up 47 wickets. The Hyderbad-based cricketer was an agile fielder and was also quick between the wickets. In his debut Test match against Australia in Brisbane he picked up six wickets giving away 55 runs.
In the same series in Sydney, Abid Ali scored a couple of gritty half-centuries (78 and 81). The all-rounder was also known for scoring winning runs at the Oval in a famous win against England in 1971.
After 22 years of playing first-class cricket for his beloved Hyderabad and South Zone, apart from India, and coaching since 1978, Ali had the best credentials when the UAE came looking in 2001. He always believed in ‘‘taking a side at the bottom right to the top’’ — he’d already done that with the Andhra Pradesh team — and so jumped at the offer.
‘‘When I was with AP we initially had a tough time but, when I left, they were good enough to be in the Elite division.’’ The journey from Hyderabad to Dubai via San Francisco (where he’s lived since 1980) has certainly been eventful.
Ali also had the coaching stints in teams like the Maldives and the Andhra Ranji team in the past in addition to UAE.
It was back in 1996 that Abid Ali underwent bypass surgery. Somehow, news got out that he hadn’t come round and the TV channels picked it up. India were on tour in England and condolences flowed, especially from his former mates as Indian cricket mourned the loss of a ‘‘honest servant’’. One journalist even called, asking him if he was alive!

Title: ‘Happy to see him realise his potential’: Dilip Vengsarkar lauds Shreyas Iyer after Champions Trophy triumph
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dilip-vengsarkar-shreyas-iyer-potential-champions-trophy-9882991/
Content:
After a roller-coaster year when he won the IPL and was dropped from the BCCI central contracts at the same time, Indian middle order batter Shreyas Iyer played a vital role in the team’s triumphant Champions Trophy campaign. Former India selector Dilip Vengsarkar was all praises for the current Punjab Kings’ captain, saying he has realised his potential.
“Iyer did very well but I am not happy the way he got out in the final. He should have continued till the very end and finished the game. But happy to see him realise his potential. KL too played a few important innings at number six but still not convinced Axar Patel batting ahead of him at five. The left-hand right-hand combination could be the only reason,” Vengsarkar said.
Iyer also finished second in the batting charts of the Champions Trophy with 243 runs, just behind New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra.
Vengsarkar also gave due credit to the selection panel led by Ajit Agarkar. “Credit needs to go to the selectors as well. They stuck with Rohit after the Australia series. Even the decision to take five spinners in the squad proved to be a master stroke,” he added.
Last year, Iyer became the eighth captain to win the coveted IPL title as he led KKR to their third championship, beating SunRisers Hyderabad. Despite three seasons with the franchise, Iyer was released by KKR, following which he became the second-most IPL auction signing ever when Punjab snapped him up for Rs 26.75 crore in the auctions.

Punjab will be Iyer’s third franchise in the IPL and a third stint in a leadership role. After having started out in the IPL in 2015 with the Delhi Capitals, Iyer was raised to captaincy in the 2018 season. He also led the Capitals to their first IPL final in the 2020 season.

Title: ‘Player of his stature should get to decide about future’: Dilip Vengsarkar on unwarranted’ retirement speculations on Rohit Sharma
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dilip-vengsarkar-rohit-sharma-retirement-unwanted-speculations-9882966/
Content:
Former India player Dilip Vengsarkar said that people should stop speculating on Rohit Sharma’s retirement, adding that the current India skipper deserve time and space to decide on their future. Rumours were rampant before the final of the Champions Trophy about Rohit calling it a day after winning the trophy but the Hitman dismissed them in the post-match press conference.
“I am not an astrologer. A lot of matches to go till the 2027 World Cup. A lot will depend on his form and fitness. It is not fair to say anything at this stage but he has been outstanding as both captain and player,” Vengsarkar told PTI.
“I don’t know why people speculated (on his retirement), it’s unwarranted. A player of his stature should get to decide about his future,” he added.
Vengsarkar also said that both Rohit and compatriot Virat Kohli are big match performers who with their sheer presence can put pressure on any opposition.
“The way he has been playing all this time is nothing short of exemplary. He has got three double hundreds in ODI. What more do I say about him. Guys like Virat and Rohit are big match players, bigger the platform the better the performance. It is very important from team’s point of view. Their sheer presence is demoralising the opposition,” said Vengsarkar
In a recent interaction with JioHotstar, the Rohit had delved deeper on what lies ahead for him in the near future.

“Right now, I am taking things as they come. It wouldn’t be fair for me to think too far ahead. At this moment, my focus is on playing well and maintaining the right mindset. I don’t want to draw any lines and say whether I will or won’t play in the 2027 World Cup. There’s no point in making such statements right now. Realistically, I have always taken my career one step at a time,” Rohit said earlier in the week.

Gill has also recently come under praise from former India player Sanjay Bangar who said that the Punjab player will lead the Indian team’s batting in the years to come.
“Clearly, he’s the guy who is going to shoulder the responsibility of the Indian team going forward in years to come,” Bangar said on JioHotstar.
Meanwhile, Gill also retained his spot at the top of the ODI batter rankings after his display during the Champions Trophy, while his Indian captain Rohit Sharma came up from 5th to third after his match-winning performance against New Zealand in the final.

Their teammate, Virat Kohli is currently ranked No. 5 with his 218 runs in the Champions Trophy.

Title: Sanju Samson shares his bond with Jos Buttler: He was my vice-captain and played…I would change the rule of releasing players

Content:
Jos Buttler has been one of the premium players for Rajasthan Royals in the last few years. However, the rules of Indian Premier League retention are such that the Royals had to make a difficult choice for Buttler to go away from the franchise. Royals captain Sanju Samson would go as far as to say if it was up to him he would change the rule of releasing the players.
“When I became captain, he was my vice-captain and played a huge role in helping me lead the team. Letting him go has been one of the most challenging things for me. Even during the England series, I told him over dinner that I was still not over it. If I could change one thing in the IPL, I would change the rule of releasing players. While it has its positives, on a personal level, you lose connections and relationships built over years. It has been hard for me, the entire franchise, the owners, the coaches, and everyone associated with RR. Jos was family to us,” Samson said speaking on Star Sports.
“IPL gives you the opportunity to lead a team and play at the highest level, but it also allows you to build close friendships. Jos Buttler is one of my closest friends. We played together for seven years, forming a long batting partnership. We knew each other so well and always kept in touch. He was like an elder brother to me,” he added.
Sanju Samson  (Rs 18 crore), Yashasvi Jaiswal (Rs 18 crore), Riyan Parag (Rs 14 crore), Dhruv Jurel (Rs 14 crore),  Shimron Hetmyer (Rs 11 crore), Sandeep Sharma (Rs 4 crore)

Title: India ODI schedule after Champions Trophy win: How many matches will Men in Blue play before 2027 World Cup?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-odi-schedule-before-2027-world-cup-full-match-list-9882681/
Content:
Team India put their 2023 ODI World Cup heartbreak behind last Sunday when they lifted the ICC Champions Trophy title after defeating New Zealand by four wickets in the final in Dubai. Rohit Sharma’s men also made a redemption of sorts after they defeated world champions Australia to reach the summit clash.
While heavyweights Rohit and Virat Kohli have denied any plans of retirement, India’s road to the next World Cup, slated to be held in October-November 2027 in Africa could perhaps witness the onset of some transition and fresh names in the ODI set-up. Unlike the previous four-year cycles, India are likely to have reduced game time to set up their squad for the next 50-over World Cup.
According to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP), India are slated to play 27 ODIs before the World Cup will be played in South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe. However, changes could be incorporated into the FTP over the next two years.
August 2025: India vs Bangladesh – 3 ODIs (Away)
October 2025: India vs Australia – 3 ODIs (Away)
November 2025: India vs South Africa – 3 ODIs (Home)
January 2026: India vs New Zealand – 3 ODIs (Home)
June 2026: India vs Afghanistan – 3 ODIs (Home)
July 2026: India vs England – 3 ODIs (Away)
September 2026: India vs West Indies – 3 ODIs (Home)
November 2026: India vs New Zealand – 3 ODIs (Away)
December 2026: India vs Sri Lanka – 3 ODIs (Home)

Title: ‘ICC stands for Indian Cricket Board’: Andy Roberts slams Rohit Sharma’s team for no travel during Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-stands-for-india-champions-trophy-2025-andy-roberts-9882600/
Content:
West Indies pace legend Sir Andy Roberts slammed India’s considerable advantage at playing at one venue in Dubai during their march to the Champions Trophy title and labelled the International Cricket Council as a representative of the Indian cricket board, BCCI.
“Something’s got to give… India can’t get everything. The ICC [International Cricket Council] must say no to India at times. India even had an advantage at last year’s T20 World Cup, where they knew in advance where their semi-final would be played [in Guyana]. At the Champions Trophy, India did not have to travel at all. How can a team not travel during a tournament,” Roberts was quoted as saying by Mid-Day.
Roberts highlighted the lack of fairness in the eight-team tournament where others teams were forced to travel from Pakistan to face India in the United Arab Emirates.
“It is not fair, it’s not cricket. There has to be a level playing field. I know a lot of money comes from India, but cricket ought not to be a  one-country sport. It now looks like a one-nation competition and the playing field is not level. To me, the ICC stands for the Indian Cricket Board. India dictates everything. If tomorrow, India says, ‘listen there should be no no-balls and wides,’ take my word, the ICC will find a way to satisfy India,” Roberts lamented.
The two-time World Cup winner’s comments come shortly after his former teammate Vivian Richards echoed similar sentiments against the ICC.
“I don’t want to get into the political side of things. But I believe the people who are responsible, in terms of the governing and the ruling of the game in itself which is the ICC… they’re the ones who I think got the problem. I would like them to come up with an answer, why? If they are the governing body of cricket, why is that happening at present? I honestly believe one of the things that can bring all of us together, fans and everyone, even enemies together, [is] sports,” said the legendary Richards recently during the International Masters League in India.

Title: Wouldn’t want Jasprit Bumrah to play more than Two Tests in a row against England: Shane Bond
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wouldnt-want-jasprit-bumrah-to-play-more-than-two-tests-in-a-row-against-england-shane-bond-9882424/
Content:
Former New Zealand pacer Shane Bond has advised that India should not play Jasprit Bumrah for ‘more than two Tests in a row’ during this summer’s tour to England. Bond warned that another injury to the Indian ace could be a ‘career ender’.
Bumrah hasn’t played since the fifth Test against Australia in Sydney in January, when he walked off for scans on Day 2. It was later diagnosed as a stress injury, forcing him to sit out of the Champions Trophy.
Bond, who had his fair share of injuries, warned that the transition from the Indian Premier League, starting March 22, to the new World Test Championship cycle ‘will be a risk.’
“He’s too valuable for the next World Cup and stuff. So you’d be looking at five Tests in England, I wouldn’t want to be playing him in any more than two in a row. Coming out of the back end of the IPL into a Test match is going to be a huge risk. And so how do they manage that is going to be key.
“They may say, look, it’s four Test matches in total. Or three. If we can get him through the English summer and he’s fit, we can probably then go with some confidence that we can carry him across the rest of the formats. So that’s hard because he is your best bowler, but if he has another injury in the same spot, that could be a career-ender, potentially, because I’m not sure you can have surgery on that spot again.”
India’s tour of England will include five Tests, to be played between June 28 and August 3.

Title: Ricky Ponting on Rohit Sharma’s decision to continue playing: Unfinished business from 2023 World Cup may be on his mind
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ricky-ponting-rohit-sharma-retirement-unfinished-business-world-cup-2027-9882267/
Content:
Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said that a sense of unfinished business may have played a role in Rohit Sharma’s decision to continue playing international cricket, quashing the rumours of his retirement.
Ponting said losing the final of the 2023 World Cup could have kept the fire burning within Rohit to give the 50-over title one last shot. India, under Rohit’s captaincy, sailed through to the final of the 2023 edition before falling to Australia in the decider. The 2027 World Cup will be held in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
“I think probably the fact that they lost the last one and he was captain, that might be the thing that’s playing on the back of his mind,” Ponting was quoted as saying by The ICC Review. “Just have one more crack at trying to win the T20 World Cup, the Champions Trophy, and the ODI World Cup. I mean when you see him play like he played in the Champions Trophy final, you wouldn’t say that his time is up just yet.”
Rohit’s future in India colours has been a topic of high speculation over the last few months, and it was rumoured that he would retire after the Champions Trophy, which India won last Sunday after beating New Zealand.
However, the India captain quashed those rumours. “One more thing, I’m not going to retire from this format, just to make sure no more rumours are spread,” Rohit said after the final.
Ponting agreed with Rohit’s decision to not draw curtains on his career. “When you start getting to that point of your career, everyone’s waiting for you to retire,” Ponting said. “And I don’t know why, when you can still play as well as he’s played (in the final), I think he was just trying to put those questions to bed once and for all and say, ‘no, I’m still playing well enough. I love playing in this team. I love leading this team.’ And I think, the fact that he said that, to me, it means that he must have that goal in mind of playing in the next (50-over) World Cup (in 2027).”

Title: ‘Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli still batting incredibly well’: Shane Watson reckons India seniors can continue keeping youngsters out
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-batting-youngsters-out-shane-watson-9882194/
Content:
Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson has backed India superstars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to continue leading the batting line-ups in the longer formats after their recent Champions Trophy displays.
Kohli finished with 218 runs as India’s second-highest run-getter in the tournament with a century against Pakistan and a match-winning 84 against Australia in the semi-final. Meanwhile, skipper Rohit aggregated 180 runs after setting up a 252-run chase against New Zealand with a stroke-filled 76.
Watson backed the senior duo to continue playing for India as long as they maintain the form and fitness at the top.
“Those guys are still batting incredibly well. So, Virat, how well he batted during the tournament, the runs he got, he still is the best chaser that’s ever played the game of ODI cricket. And we saw how well he’s batting. And Rohit, in the final, that was an amazing innings against the New Zealand bowling attack,” Watson told in an interaction with Hindustan Times.
“… if those guys are still batting as well as they are, and they still feel the energy and the fire still burning so brightly to play for India, then absolutely, that will keep out the younger guys coming through because they’re that good,” he added.
Watson lavished praise on the senior duo’s big-match presence and said they could still give the youngsters a run for their money.
“They know how to perform under pressure, like we saw in the Champions Trophy. A knockout, really, nearly a knockout tournament, and they played incredibly well, especially when the team needed it the most. If those guys want to keep playing, then it’s just the younger guys who are coming through, then they need to really bash down the door. And the only way to do that is scoring a crazy amount of runs and doing extraordinary things if they want to even try and push their way into that Indian team,” Watson remarked.

Title: ‘He thinks less about himself’: Virender Sehwag highlights ‘underrated’ aspect of Rohit Sharma’s captaincy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virender-sehwag-rohit-sharma-captaincy-ms-dhoni-comparison-9882022/
Content:
Former India opener Virender Sehwag hailed captain Rohit Sharma’s leadership skills and ability to communicate with his players after their triumphant Champions Trophy 2025 campaign in Dubai.
Led by Rohit’s exemplary batting, India recorded a four-wicket win over New Zealand last Sunday, marking a second ICC title under his captaincy in less than nine months since the T20 World Cup victory in Barbados.
Sehwag, who played a considerable part in the 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2011 World Cup wins under MS Dhoni, considered Rohit as a better communicator.
“We underrate his (Rohit’s) captaincy, but after these two trophies, he became the second (Indian) captain after Dhoni to win multiple ICC titles. The way the captain has used his bowlers, the way he has handled the team, the way he has guided the team, and whatever communication he does, he does it very clearly. Whether it’s playing Harshit Rana first ahead of Arshdeep Singh or bringing in Varun Chakravarty in place of Harshit Rana, he has communicated well with his players, which was important. That’s why Rohit Sharma is a better captain,” Sehwag said on Cricbuzz.
Rohit’s fearless batting in the Powerplay has been the hallmark of India’s batting approach since the 2023 ODI World Cup where the side won all but the final match against Australia. The team has since won every game it has played in two ICC events across white-ball formats under Rohit.
“He thinks less about himself, more about his team, his teammates. He makes them comfortable. He realises that if a player has insecurity, then his performance will not come. That’s why he doesn’t let anyone feel insecure in that team. He takes everyone with him. This is the need for a better captain and leader. And Rohit Sharma is doing it very well,” Sehwag remarked.

Title: Axar Patel: Understated, unsung Nadiad boy is now DC captain
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/axar-patel-nadiad-boy-journey-kheda-india-champions-trophy-hero-9881957/
Content:
From being an all-purpose utility player, Axar Patel is now a leader. From being the Man Friday to several captains, the all-rounder will now be calling the shots. By naming Axar as their captain for the 2025 season, Delhi Capitals have thrown their weight behind a player who till now was seen as a backroom boy, an unsung hero. The rise and rise of the talented player from Nadiad in Gujarat, a temple town and educational hub, is a fairytale story that Indian cricket repeatedly throws up.
A visit to Nadiad, during the just-concluded Champions Trophy that India won and where Axar had an out-sized impact, shows the place happens to be as understated as the first world-class cricketer it has produced. Every Axar anecdote in the city that raised him begins with the same question: “Have you seen the canal?” It’s hard to miss the winding channel that runs through the centre of Nadiad, lending the dusty, arid place a soothing touch.
Right on its edge, on a tree-laden dirt road, Bharat bhai regales you with heartwarming stories of the ‘normal person, who has no airs about himself’ over kadak cha and lasaniya daabla. The hard-on-heart snack — deep-fried potatoes with garlic-based spicy stuffing in chickpea flour, a local bhajiya delicacy — would fuel a young Axar’s mornings.
“He’d sit there…” says the modest roadside stall owner, pointing at the concrete parapet along the canal, “…and have his meal with tea — less water, ginger, a little sugar and some cardamom. For the 15-20 years that he’s been coming here, he’s had his tea made the same way.”
The rest of the day would be spent at the cricket ground — located inside his college campus — less than 500m from here. By evening, Axar would be back at the canal, pouring Thums Up in a glass and emptying a packet of sing bhujia in it.
“He survived on that,” laughs Keval Patel, Axar’s childhood friend; still unable to wrap his head around one of India’s fittest cricketer’s eating habits.
“Even today,” says Keval, “when he returns home, you can spot Axar at the canal, relaxing with his friends over endless cups of tea. To the world, he might be ‘Axar’. For us, he is still the same, old ‘Akshar’.”
What’s in a name, you ask? The man’s complete identity.
‘Akshar’ remains a simpleton at home, a large-hearted friend and a ruthless prankster who binges on ‘padikas’ (tiny snack packets) and home-made bhaakri dipped in ginger tea. On the cricket field, ‘Axar’ — the spelling change thanks to an administrative error at school — devours wickets and feeds on big hits.
***
In some ways, if Nadiad defined Axar, Axar is now redefining Nadiad, bringing the forgotten town back into prominence.
Nadiad, in railway parlance, is a short two-minute stop between the country’s milk capital, Anand, and trading hub, Ahmedabad. In the history books, it’s a mere answer to trivia as the birthplace of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birthplace. The ancient city continues to draw believers to its nearly 200-year-old temple and aspirants at many of its reputed education institutes. But on the 22-yards, it has always been dwarfed by Baroda and Saurashtra, places with proper cricketing heritage.
Engineering, not cricket, might have been Axar’s calling too if not for his father, Rajeshbhai, who sent him to the city’s only ground to improve his fitness — not in terms of losing weight, Axar in his childhood was slender than he is right now, but to gain muscle.
“We met for the first time at the ground,” says Keval. “As is the norm, for a couple of days, we were made to run laps. Axar got bored and began bunking. He’d leave home wearing whites but go to another place to play tennis-ball cricket.”
One morning, Rajeshbhai swung by at the ground only to be surprised by his son. “Proper padi hati (he had it properly),” Keval says in Gujarati. “After that, he never bunked practice.”
Axar didn’t have to. He completely immersed himself in his new routine, not knowing that the 2km stretch from the canal to his home, with the cricket ground and his college on the way, would shape his life.
It’s where he would learn his craft, continue to shine academically, make lifelong friendships, meet his childhood sweetheart whom he’d eventually marry and build a new home that, unsurprisingly, is a short walk from the canal.
***
The wider cricketing world might have woken up to his batting exploits at No. 5 only now after Gautam Gambhir promoted him to experiment with left-right combinations, strengthen the batting depth and provide the captain with more bowling options.
But those who have watched him grow since his childhood are hardly surprised. For, he has always played in that position — and rarely failed.
“Axar bowled pace in school competitions,” says Amrish Patel, Axar’s childhood coach. “He had long strides because of his height but didn’t have enough leg strength and would sometimes fall over while releasing the ball. When he would get tired, he’d switch to spin. That’s when he would take wickets.”
Over the years, they moulded him into a spin-bowling all-rounder but in his mind, Axar was never in doubt that batting remained his predominant craft.
“He enjoyed playing lofted shots,” says former Gujarat Ranji Trophy player and selector Bharat Mistry. “Once, during the Under-16 West Zone tournaments, he was dismissed while attempting those shots in successive matches, wasting his good starts. Some selectors wanted to drop him as a punishment for his reckless shots. But a couple of us backed him, advised him to be more judicious with his shot selection.”
He was retained for the final match against Saurashtra in Rajkot. “And he scored a century there,” adds Keval. “Since then, he has never looked back. Bowling was something he was always confident of doing well. But contributions with the bat have given him more pleasure.”
Around four years ago, during the phase when he wasn’t getting consistent game time, Axar returned to the ground where he began his journey, and spent ‘three-to-four hours’ every afternoon polishing his game.
“For the first half hour or so, he’d only block,” says Gujarat’s Ranji Trophy player Vishal Jayswal, who, like Axar, bats left-handed and bowls left-arm spin. “After that, he would unshackle himself. He’d hit really long… every day, we lost 2-3 balls and by the end of the session, we’d be completely knackered.”
During those sessions, he rediscovered his love for his ‘favourite’ shot: the slog sweep. “He always loved to play that but had reduced it a lot in the last few years,” says Keval.
Until it resurfaced again. Once famously during the T20 World Cup final against South Africa last year, and then against New Zealand earlier in the Champions Trophy. Unshackling himself with a slog-sweep off Mitchel Santner and propelling India to a match-winning total.
***
Manish Desai, the president of the Kheda District Cricket Association, gauges success not only by the trophies and individual awards Axar keeps piling up but also by the transformational impact he has had on the game in Nadiad.
After he first played in the Indian Premier League, there was an elaborate roadshow where thousands lined up to welcome Axar. A similar procession was planned following India’s T20 World Cup title this year. When Axar learnt about it, he delayed his homecoming and returned only on one condition. “He didn’t want any functions,” Desai says. “He requested me to gather all the academy boys and girls at the ground and have an intimate session with them. He not only shared his life experiences with them but also told stories behind the World Cup win.”
Desai says that from ‘70-80 boys’ a decade ago, between 250 and 300 young players train at their ground daily, ‘aspiring to be like Axar’. That number, he adds, will increase during the summer vacation camps.
But while boys were always drawn to the sport, Desai says Axar’s success has inspired many families in Nadiad to send their daughters to the ground.
Ami Patel, who started playing just two years ago, says there used to be just one-odd girl who’d play along with ‘hundreds of boys’ earlier. “But after seeing Axar making a successful career in cricket, more girls have come forward. In last year’s summer camp, there were 40 girls!” Ami, 25, says.
She was one of the players sitting in the audience last year when Axar relived the T20 World Cup title-winning campaign with them, hanging onto every word he spoke. By the end of the session, Axar’s ‘simplicity’ left her amazed.
“Whenever he is in Nadiad, he doesn’t give a vibe that he is such a big cricketer. He behaves like one of us, almost like saying ‘This is my ground, my people, my Nadiad. I’ll play, relax and just be myself.’”

Title: WPL 2025: Smriti Mandhana’s RCB spoil Mumbai Indians’ party, Delhi Capitals’ top spot confirmed

Delhi Capitals played their last league match on March 7 in Lucknow, and they will next be in action on Saturday in the final as their top spot was finally confirmed on Tuesday. They had to wait till the last over of the league phase to have confirmation for their place on top of the standings as Mumbai Indians fell short in the run-chase against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Brabourne Stadium. Meg Lanning’s DC have now made it to the final for the third straight season but will come in cold to the title clash because of the skewed schedule. In contrast, MI – should they reach the final – will play four matches in six days. First up, they take on Gujarat Giants in the Eliminator on Thursday.
The story of the night in Mumbai was RCB’s batting unit firing collectively as they reached 199/3 in their 20 overs. MI  In what has been a tournament tailor-made for run-chases, Brabourne Stadium has now witnessed back-to-back wins for sides batting first.
Asked to bat first, RCB rode on skipper Smriti Mandhana’s 37-ball 53 and useful contributions from Ellyse Perry (49 off 38 balls), Richa Ghosh (36 off 22) and Georgia Wareham (31 off 10). In reply, MI were stopped at 188/9 with Nat Sciver-Brunt scoring a sensational 35-ball 69. S Sajana raised MI hopes with a 12-ball 23 before perishing to Perry. For RCB, Sneh Rana registered excellent figures of 3/26 in four overs, while Georgia Wareham (1/29 in 4) was also impressive with the ball. Kim Garth picked up two wickets for 33 runs as RCB emerged victorious.
Earlier, RCB were off to a flying start with the opening duo of skipper Mandhana and S Meghana putting on 41 runs in quick time before the latter got out while going for one too many. Mandhana later chuckled at how her own season with the bat resembled her team’s – good start, good finish, lost out in the middle phase. “Being in touch and not scoring was eating away at me, so nice to contribute,” she said. Her reaction for the half century was understandably muted as well.

For MI, going into the knockouts, there are a couple of concerns to address. The move to promote Amelia Kerr to open with Hayley Matthews hasn’t paid off. Their batting unit is still overly reliant on Nat Sciver Brunt, Harmanpreet Kaur and Matthews. With the ball, the MI skipper rued the runs that were leaked in the last couple of overs. It’s been a up-and-down season for the inaugural edition winners, and now they have lost their first match in Mumbai. On the flip side though, they have never lost to Gujarat Giants across three seasons of WPL and will head into the Eliminator with the upper-hand.

Title: ‘On what basis has he been recalled?’: Shahid Afridi questions Shadab Khan’s inclusion in squad for NZ tour, says Pakistan cricket is in ICU
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shahid-afridi-slams-shadab-khan-pak-squad-pakistan-icu-9881149/
Content:
Former Pakistan player Shahid Afridi criticized the inclusion of allrounder Shadab Khan in the T20 squad which is set to take on New Zealand, saying that due to these incorrect decisions, Pakistan cricket is in ICU. Shadab was left out in the cold after Pakistan’s disastrous performance in the 2024 T20 World Cup but was recently reinstated and also given the vice captaincy for the tour against the Kiwis.
“On what basis has he been recalled? What are his performances in domestic cricket or otherwise that he had been picked again. All the time we talk about preparations and when an event comes and we flop then we talk about surgery. Fact is Pakistan cricket is in ICU because of incorrect decisions.”
Afridi also said that whenever a new chairman takes charge, he changes everything which becomes detrimental for Pakistan cricket’s progress.
“There is no continuity, consistency in the Board’s decisions and policies. We keep changing captains, coaches or some players but in the end what is the accountability for Board officials,” the former skipper questioned.
“How can our cricket progress when there is a sword hanging constantly over the captain and coaches’ heads,” he added.
Pakistan recently released the squads which will play five T20Is and three ODIs in New Zealand starting March 16. Mohammad Rizwan and team talisman Babar Azam were dropped from the squad for the T20 series in New Zealand. Salman Ali Agha was named as the replacement for Rizwan as Pakistan captain of the T20 outfit with Shadab earning a recall into the team and being named vice-captain.

While Pakistan were eliminated from the Champions Trophy under his watch, Rizwan was retained as the ODI captain for the tour of New Zealand. However, pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf were left out of the ODI team for the New Zealand tour. Batters Saud Shakil and Kamran Ghulam have also been axed from the ODI team.

Title: ‘Felt I didn’t get the recognition I wanted after winning the IPL’: Shreyas Iyer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shreyas-iyer-kkr-ipl-title-win-recognition-9881084/
Content:
Shreyas Iyer who played a vital role in India’s triumphant Champions Trophy campaign, opened up about how he felt he did not get the required recognition when he led Kolkata Knight Riders to their 3rd Indian Premier League (IPL) title last year. This season, the batter will lead Punjab Kings who brought him for a whopping Rs 26.75 crore in the auctions after he was not retained by KKR.
“I personally felt I didn’t get the recognition I wanted after winning the IPL but at the end of the day, as long as you have self-integrity and you keep doing the right things when no one is watching, that is more important and that is what I kept doing,” Iyer said to The Times of India.
Last year, Iyer became the eighth captain to win the coveted IPL title as he led KKR to their third championship, beating SunRisers Hyderabad. Despite three seasons with the franchise, Iyer was released by KKR, following which he became the second-most IPL auction signing ever when Punjab snapped him up for Rs 26.75 crore in the auctions.
Punjab will be Iyer’s third franchise in the IPL and a third stint in a leadership role. After having started out in the IPL in 2015 with the Delhi Capitals, Iyer was raised to captaincy in the 2018 season. He also led the Capitals to their first IPL final in the 2020 season.
Iyer also finished second in the batting charts of the recently concluded Champions Trophy with 243 runs, just behind New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra.

Iyer has had a banner year in 2024 as a player with the batter being a part of the Mumbai team that won the Ranji and Irani trophy and under his leadership, Mumbai won their second Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in December 2024.

India player Rishabh Pant is known for his unorthodox stroke play with his USP being his trademark shot being the one-handed six where the bat often slips from his grips. In a recent conversation with JioHotstar, the 27-year-old explained why this happens.
“I think it mostly happens because I hold my bottom hand very lightly. I mainly try to use my bottom hand for support because, at times, it starts dominating. So, I focus on gripping my top hand tightly,” said Pant.
“But when I overreach—especially when the ball is too wide or too short—it’s not always in the ideal hitting zone. Sometimes, the shot I attempt may only have a 30-40% success rate, but depending on the match situation, I’m willing to take that risk. That’s my mindset,” he added.
“When I take that chance and overreach, I need to do something to maintain balance. At times, it may look like I’m throwing the bat, but in reality, I’m just trying to make the most of that delivery. If my bat slips, if it’s not in my hand, or even if it hits my head—my only focus at that moment is finding the boundary,” he concluded.
Pant, who was in the India side which won the Champions Trophy recently but did not get a match, will next be seen in action leading the Lucknow Super Giants in the upcoming Indian Premier League season. Pant was bagged by Lucknow Super Giants for Rs 27 crores after a ferocious bidding war at the IPL auction.

While his former franchise Delhi Capitals opted for an Right To Match bid at Rs 20.75 crore, LSG raised the bidding by a staggering margin to Rs 27 crore, make him the most expensive signing at the auctions history ahead of Shreyas Iyer, who received a Rs 26.75 crore bid from Punjab Kings earlier this evening.

Title: ‘I think today, people are more focused on IPL’: Rishabh Pant urges budding players to aim for India cap alongside franchise league

India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant on Tuesday said that even though the attraction of playing the Indian Premier League (IPL) is understandable, up and coming players should always aim to play for the country. Pant, who was part of India’s triumphant Champions Trophy squad but did not get a game, made his international debut back in 2017.
“Since childhood, I had only one dream—to play for India. I never even thought about playing in the IPL. I think today, people are more focused on the IPL. Of course, it’s a great platform, but I believe that if your goal is to play for your country, everything else—including the IPL—will eventually fall into place,” Pant told JioHotstar.
“If you have that bigger mindset, success will follow. I always believed that I would play for India one day, and God has been kind. At 18, I got the opportunity to make my debut, and I am grateful for that,” said the 27-year-old.
Last week, Pant was nominated for the prestigious Laureus World Sports Award 2025 in the comeback of the year category after his return to the Indian side after surviving a horrific car accident in December 2022. The awards ceremony will take place in Madrid on April 21.
Pant had suffered multiple injuries when his car collided with a road divider on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. The player, who was going to his home in Roorkee, was taken to a local hospital before being shifted to Dehradun. He had suffered injuries on his head, back and feet.

After undergoing initial treatment at a hospital in Dehradun, Pant was airlifted to Mumbai where he was under the care of the BCCI’s specialist consultant. Once the surgeries to reconstruct all three ligaments in his right knee were performed, Pant did his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.

Title: Michael Vaughan picks India’s alternate playing XI that would have made it to Champions Trophy final

Content:
Former England captain Michael Vaughan picked up an “alternate playing XI” for India, suggesting it was strong enough to reach the Champions Trophy final.
“Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tilak Varma, Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravi Bishnoi…. This team would have made it to the final as well IMO,” he posted on X.
“The strength in Indian cricket in white ball is off the scale,” he said.
On Sunday in Dubai, India won their second ICC evens on the bounce with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final.
After the final, Vaughan has posted how the rest of the world now has to try and catch up.
“Let’s be honest India are the best team in the world in white ball cricket by a decent margin .. Thoroughly deserved to Win .. T20 holders/Champions trophy holders .. Now down to rest to try and catch up,” he said.
It was India’s 23rd win in 24 games across the last three men’s ICC events stretching back to 2023 – the only loss coming against Australia in the 2023 Cricket World Cup final.
India won the T20 World Cup final against South Africa last year.
India’s previous success came in 2013 and it was runner-up to Pakistan in 2017. It also shared the trophy with Sri Lanka in 2002 after a rain-affected two-day final.
India went through the entire tournament unbeaten after wins against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand in the group phase, and then Australia in the semifinal.
All of India’s matches were played in Dubai after the Indian government refused permission for its team to go to official host Pakistan on security grounds.

Michael Bracewell will lead New Zealand in the upcoming five-game T20I series against Pakistan, the New Zealand Cricket said in a statement. Bracewell captained the New Zealand during the white-ball tour of Pakistan in April last year. New Zealand will play a five-match T20I series against Pakistan, starting from March 16.
The 34-year-old, who has played a crucial role in the final against India in the Champions Trophy is one of seven players from the squad set to join the T20 camp in Christchurch on Friday.
“It’s a great honour and a real privilege to captain your country,” he said.
“I really enjoyed leading the side in Pakistan last year and we’ve got many players from that squad included for this series as well, which is nice.
“Mitch Santner’s done a great job since taking over as white-ball captain and I’ll really just be trying to build on his good work and create an enjoyable environment for the guys to perform in.
“Pakistan are always a dangerous short-form side with lots of power and pace and we know they’ll be hurting after an early exit in the Champions Trophy.
“For the guys coming back from Dubai, there’s obviously a level of disappointment, but also a lot of pride in the way we were able to perform and represent New Zealand.
“We’ve loved all of the support we’ve received from afar and are certainly looking forward to getting back home and playing in front of our own fans and in front of full venues.”
The T20 regulars Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra and white-ball captain Mitchell Santner unavailable with IPL commitments.
Gary Stead will lead the coaching staff, alongside batting coach Luke Ronchi and bowling coach Jacob Oram.

Title: R Ashwin: India can replicate what Australia did in the 1990s till 2010

Content:
R Ashwin said the biggest takeaway from India’s Champions Trophy win is that they won without their spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and pointed out how India can dominate the world cricket like the Australia did in the 1990s and 2000s.
“I think the world cricketing fraternity will take some time to catch up with Indian team if we will go on with this flow,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“In the future it will be huge advantage for India’s next generation. India can replicate what Australia did in the 90s and till 2010. India have that arsenal and infrastructure.
“We just need to remind everyone that we have not won because of the batting, it was because of our bowling. Please look after the bowlers. From the grassroot level, we must encourage the bowlers,” he said.
Ashwin credited Indian bowlers for the Champions Trophy win and also listed the three guaranteed starter for India in the 2026 T20 World Cup, which will be held in India.
“We there was no Jasprit Bumrah and we won the trophy without Jasprit Bumrah, isn’t it amazing. what does it tell you about the Indian cricket? I am so very happy. This particularly CT is completely dedicated to the bowlers. Without Jasprit Bumrah, we won hats off to the bowlers.
“In 2026 World T20 team, write the names of Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy and then pick your squad. It will be one hell of an attack.”
Ashwin also said how Indian team were bit unlucky in the ICC tournaments.
“I always felt that luck was not going our way all this year when it comes to the ICC events. We were always a quality side. In the last ten years we could have won more. The 2017 CT final, it was a par score at Oval, we didn’t win, the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, we lost the final against Sri Lanka. But this feeling is amazing,” he said.
“I have said this after we won the T20 World Cup that now we are going to win two or three on the bounce. I was a bit nervous but I was confident. It was written all over, it was New Zealand who were under pressure.
“I am so happy for Rohit and GG (Gautam Gambhir). Especially for GG, imagine what he must be going through. We lost the home series against New Zealand. But he took a brave decision replacing Jasprit Bumrah with Varun Chakaravarthy.”

Title: Australia vs England 150th anniversary Test to be played under lights at iconic MCG
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-vs-england-150th-anniversary-test-day-night-melbourne-cricket-ground-9880176/
Content:
Australia will play a day-night Test at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) against archrivals England in 2027 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Test cricket, Cricket Australia (CA) announced on Tuesday.
The 150th Anniversary Test will be played from March 11-15, 2027, and will be the first time the Australian team will play a Test under lights at the MCG, the scene of the first Test match in 1877 and the Centenary Test in 1977 – remarkably, both won by Australia by 45 runs.
This will follow the historic first day-night Test at the MCG earlier this year where Australia’s women completed an Ashes clean-sweep.
Late arrival of Australian and England players in IPL 2027?
The match, which will come after Australia’s five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in India 2027, is also likely to mean the late arrival of Australia and England players to the 2027 Indian Premier League, with IPL franchises told to expect that year’s tournament to run between March 14 and May 30.
“The 150th Anniversary Test at the MCG will be one of the great cricket events and playing under lights will be a fantastic way to celebrate both our game’s rich heritage and Test cricket’s modern evolution,” Todd Greenberg, CEO of CA said.
“It will also help ensure more people are able to attend and watch what will be a fantastic occasion. The Centenary Test created many iconic performances including David Hookes’ five consecutive boundaries off Tony Greig, Rick McCosker batting with a broken jaw and Derek Randall’s defiant century, and I’m sure the 150th Test will create its own lifelong memories,” he added.
That Test will also make it the latest in the home summer a men’s Test has been staged in Australia since the 1978-79 series against Pakistan (which ended on March 29).

Title: R Ashwin: Rohit Sharma changed the batting landscape of India in white-ball cricket

Content:
R Ashwin said captain Rohit Sharma has changed the batting landscape of India’s white-ball with his intent. Rohit Sharma led the chase with 76 runs off 83 balls and KL Rahul’s unbeaten 34 helped India cross the finish line on 254 for 6 in 49 overs to win the Champions Trophy for the third time.
“Against New Zealand Rohit Sharma has played a measured knock. It was not like Ahmedabad,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“The way he attacked Nathan Smith. He never let him came back into the game. His intent was so good,” he said.
Ashwin jogged back the memory lane and revealed how Rohit led by example after India were hammered by England in the semifinal of the 2022 T20 World Cup.
“He has led by example since that 2022 T20 World Cup semifinal loss against England. If a captain is willing to risk his wicket in the middle, the players know that’s how they will have to play.
“Rohit’s biggest legacy is not about winning the tournaments. He has won five IPL titles with Mumbai Indians. He has now led India to back-to-back ICC titles. That’s not his legacy. Rohit Sharma has changed the batting frontier of Indian white-ball cricket. That is his biggest legacy,” he said.
“He is a stalwart in ODI cricket. Actually he changed out cricketing thought process in the white-ball when it comes to the batting.
“Earlier it was to score big runs, remain not out. Please note this. In India the batting landscape was like this only, the top three batters will score big runs, they will improve their average.
“The mindset is same even in the junior age-group, you stay not out and score big.
“I feel as a batter now in the ODIs and in the T20Is, you must play selfless cricket.
“With that regards Rohit Sharma has changed that mindset as a captain with the way he is playing and is asking his players to play the same way. May god be with him, he has been an absolute superstar for the Indian team,” he said.

Title: Looking to 2027: After redemption, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli keen to continue
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/looking-to-2027-after-redemption-rohit-sharma-and-virat-kohli-keen-to-continue-9880010/
Content:
Minutes after India won the Champions Trophy and they played ‘dandiya’ with uprooted stumps, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli found themselves facing a gaggle of photographers. As they broke away, Rohit wisecracked, ‘bhai, hum koi retire nahi ho rahe,” and after a couple of trademark expletives, Rohit said to a laughing Kohli, “inko toh lag raha hai…” The ‘we aren’t going to retire’ couldn’t have been said in a more nonchalantly emphatic manner. Even as Rohit and Kohli were swaggering with smiles around the ground, the coach Gautam Gambhir unfurled a Hindi sher in a television chat with Navjot Singh Sidhu: “Fleeing the jungle for fear of the snake is not an option/ Learn the art of trampling the snake’s hood.” The moment was the perfect frame to capture India’s victorious campaign in the desert city.
There has been criticism about the way the tournament was loaded towards India, and even about its importance. That the Champions Trophy doesn’t have the gravitas of an ODI world cup nor can match the popularity of a T20 world cup; in fact it was disbanded eight years ago for those very reasons. The conditions in Dubai were decidedly in favour of India; all other teams had to keep crisscrossing to Pakistan, and the competitive strengths of most other teams were markedly average. But it misses the point of this triumph.
It’s not about the importance of the tournament, but its importance to this Indian team. Under a new coach, they were mauled at home in a Test series by New Zealand, and couldn’t retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia despite Jasprit Bumrah’s dazzling brilliance. The captain’s age, fitness, and form was under fire; Kohli’s hunger for runs were questioned, the coach Gautam Gambhir’s acumen and his choice of personnel was trolled, selectors’ visions were ridiculed, and the passion and commitment of the youngsters were mocked.
The present and the future of this team was under threat. The Indian team needed this victory not for bragging rights but for their sustenance. That mood overflowed in the dressing room as the Indian team celebrated for more than an hour inside what has been their sanctum for the last three exciting weeks.
The celebrations then moved on to the team hotel, where they were given a rousing reception before they reassembled for an official party. It wasn’t as big as the one at Barbados last year when they won the T20 World Cup, but the celebrations went into the wee hours of Monday morning.
In Australia, as reported by this newspaper, they had appeared a disjointed unit but as they say, nothing brings the team together like victories and these five well-earned ones against varied opponents who offered different challenges must have tasted sweetly-satisfying. They had buried the ghosts of Ahmedabad in Barbados, but this one in Dubai coming in the 50-over format would remain special for this lot of players.
Rohit encapsulated the mood after triumph: “There is a lot of hunger, even for the guys who have played a lot of cricket. It rubs down to younger players. If they see some of their other senior members showing that hunger … it shows this is how we want to play our cricket,” Rohit said.
Kohli also spoke about the necessity to leave the team in a strong place. “We wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour, and we wanted to win a big tournament. So much talent in the changeroom, they’re taking Indian cricket forward in the right direction,” Kohli said with Gill by his side. “We’re happy to share our experience but these guys are stepping up in a massive way and that’s why we’re such a strong team.”
Gill talked about how Kohli has inspired him. “Watching him (Kohli) on the TV and now seeing the intensity with which he plays is just phenomenal. It tells us what the game is all about. That’s the only thing that he talks about even off the field as well,” Gill said.
After winning the T20 World Cup, Rohit, Kohli and Jadeja sidestepped, passing the baton to the youngsters. In Tests, there is definitely some new direction needed. Now what this win does to the future of the ODI side only time will tell. If anything, the desire to lift the ODI World Cup has flowered again in the desert city.

The talismanic Virat Kohli was the biggest name among six Indian players picked in the 12-member ‘Team of the Tournament’ for the Champions Trophy.
India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the final here on Sunday to win the tournament for the third time after 2002 (joint winners) and 2013. India have been runners-up twice in 2000 and 2017.
Besides Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul, mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy and pacer Mohammed Shami featured in the playing XI, while all-rounder Axar Patel was named the 12th man.
The Black Caps have four members of their squad making the team, including Player of the Tournament Rachin Ravindra, with Mitchell Santner being named captain.
The much-awaited Champions Trophy Team of the Tournament is here 🤩

Two players from Afghanistan also made the cut after the Asian nation won their first-ever ICC Men’s Champions Trophy match in their debut appearance.
At the top of the order, Ravindra was an expected selection after he scored two centuries and topped the run-scoring charts with 263.
His knock of 112 against Bangladesh was instrumental in seeing New Zealand over the line and his 108 in the semi-final against South Africa showed he is dangerous wherever he bats.
Ravindra was joined by Ibrahim Zadran at the top of the order. The 23-year-old Afghan more than left his mark on the tournament, playing a brilliant knock of 177 — the highest-ever Champions Trophy score — against England in the group stage.
India’s Kohli slots in at number three after he finished fifth in the run-scoring charts with 218 at an average of 54.50.
Kohli made a memorable unbeaten century in his side’s group-stage win over Pakistan and a crucial 84 in the semi-final win over world champions Australia.
Teammates Shreyas and Rahul join him in the middle-order after impressive tournaments.
Iyer was India’s top run-scorer in the tournament, with two half-centuries helping him to 243 runs in total, while Rahul finished with an average of 140 thanks to unbeaten knocks of 42 and 34 in the semi-final and final respectively.
New Zealand’s Glenn Phillips is selected at number six after a brilliant performance with the bat and in the field.
Phillips’ diving one-handed catch to dismiss Shubman Gill in the final was one of three iconic takes across the tournament, while the 28-year-old scored one half century against Pakistan and took two wickets against South Africa in the semi-final to go alongside an unbeaten 49.
Azmatullah Omarzai is the second Afghan named in the team. The fast-bowling all-rounder had a fantastic tournament with both bat and ball, finishing with seven wickets at 20 and 126 runs at 42.00.
Santner is named as team captain after finishing the tournament with nine wickets – the joint second – but more importantly picked them at crucial times.
His knack of taking potential game-changing wickets was evident in the final. With the help of a sublime Phillips catch, he removed Gill and followed it up with the wicket of Iyer.
India’s Shami capped a successful return from injury by being selected after finishing with nine wickets.
Matt Henry, unfortunately, missed the final due to a shoulder injury he picked up during New Zealand’s semi-final win over South Africa but still finished as the tournament’s leading wicket-taker with 10 scalps at 16.70.

The team is completed by Chakravarthy, who took nine wickets in just three matches.
He bowled his full allocation in all the three matches he played

Title: Gautam Gambhir stamps authority with Varun Chakravarthy masterstroke but needs to be more open-minded
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gautam-gambhir-varun-chakravarthy-masterstroke-champions-trophy-9879332/
Content:
Late last year during the Australia tour, head coach Gautam Gambhir’s patience finally ran out that Melbourne evening when he had a strong spray at his players in the dressing room for losing the Boxing Day Test that seemed eminently draw-able with a couple of hours left to go on the final day.
“Bahut ho gaya, I have had enough” – Gambhir, as reported by this newspaper then, had told the team. He said he had allowed the team to do what it wanted for the “last six months” but now he would “decide” how they play. There was also a warning – it will be ‘thank you’ to those who don’t abide by his pre-decided team strategy plan.
Since that Melbourne Test, the coach has been stamping his authority more and more.
The ICC Champions Trophy was his first real big event after the Australia tour. The new beginning, under the more proactive Gambhir, would start with team selection. It’s learnt that it was him who pushed hard for the inclusion of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy; not many were as sure, but Gambhir knew what he wanted. He also pressed for pacer Harshit Rana over Mohammed Siraj. Also, like his captain, he was certain that they needed five slow bowlers in Dubai.
Congratulations to 1.4 billion Indians! Jai Hind 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 pic.twitter.com/fhIxRjKtkH
— Gautam Gambhir (@GautamGambhir) March 9, 2025
The Australia tour had embellished his confidence in the kind of players he wanted: A Nitish Kumar Reddy, who would talk about “taking a bullet for the country”; Rana, whose aggression was right down Gambhir’s gully, Washington Sundar’s allrounded-ness over Ravichandran Ashwin’s specialist expertise. Certain kinds of players found themselves edging through the cracks: Ashwin went first, Rishabh Pant too began to hover there, Shubman Gill was dropped.
It’s learnt that Gambhir wasn’t too chuffed by the performance of Ashwin and Jadeja in the home series against New Zealand, and it took Rohit’s intervention to persuade Ashwin to stay and play in the pink-ball Test. To be reduced to being an option in a ‘horses for courses’ policy perhaps didn’t sit too well with Ashwin, but Gambhir was slowly tightening his grip on the team. Jadeja, too, was out of favour for the first few games during the Australia tour.
The higher-ups in the cricket board don’t quite mind Gambhir’s approach as they see him as a man with the strength of character who could put up his views strongly even to seniors like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, if needed. At least, not fret about speaking his mind. There were a couple of players at the start of that Australia tour with captaincy aspirations, but they were cut down to size by the end.
Rohit’s inclusivity and penchant to do what’s needed for the team have allowed Gambhir’s punts and plans to go through smoothly.
Like the left-right combo through the batting line-up, even if that means KL Rahul had to be pushed down or Axar Patel pushed up. Its success emboldened Gambhir; in fact, that move was one of the earliest of his theories he had put into action after taking over as coach.
A particular fallout of that Rahul move was also the sidelining of Pant from the ODI team. Certain murmurs did swell up about the two’s past, dating to the time when both played in the Delhi Ranji Trophy team (Pant was Gambhir’s captain at one point). But in the current context, it’s more due to Pant’s ordinary ODI record (he averages 33 but has publicly said that it was an unfair assessment of his potential in that format), and more importantly, him not fitting in as the kind of player Gambhir was looking for lower down the order.
Rahul’s performances in the Champions Trophy, including in the final, have vindicated the management and selectors. Incidentally, chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and his panel’s contributions deserve a lot of credit too. They haven’t blindly gone along with all requests, stayed firm when needed but have also been open enough to let Gambhir’s theories take root.
Just like the left-right combination, Gambhir was also clear on how he wanted more players who could bowl. As he said in the post-game chat with the broadcasters, he started it right from the series against Sri Lanka, making Riyan Parag bowl. The absence of batting-allrounders has been a concern in the white-ball team for a while, and he actively sought to redress that.
It’s not all rosy of course; it remains to be seen if he creases out certain character traits.His reported ‘take it or leave it’ communication style has certainly jarred more than a few in the camp.This isn’t surprising as his style might not go down smoothly in the team, especially used to the more overtly warm and inclusive atmosphere created by Rahul Dravid. But while it must have been clear from the get-go that Gambhir’s character is different, it still might take time to get used to. However, there’s nothing like success to ensure that compatibility.
The case of Shreyas Iyer’s exclusion from the ODIs against England at home did prompt some speculation. It was only an injury to Kohli that got Iyer a spot in the first game, where he dazzled and cemented his spot. By the end of that England series, Gambhir talked about how Iyer wouldn’t have been dropped for the entire series and that he was a major player in this format. Maybe. But did Iyer know that, for his chat with the broadcasters at the end of the first game suggested otherwise.
Gambhir’s stint as a coach is at a rather delicate stage right now. After the whitewash at home against New Zealand and the defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia – though it must be said that a two-hour mad implosion in Melbourne and the absence of Jasprit Bumrah on the final day at Sydney could have made all the difference despite everything that was simmering in the camp. And now he has tasted his first success at the Champions Trophy though with the conditions and the strength of the opposition teams, it would have been a shock if India hadn’t won.
But the main takeaway from that tournament was how well the tactical thinking held up – from the careful selection decisions to the style of play, to the personalities chosen as well as the ones discarded. Now that he has got some breathing space with this win, time will tell whether Gambhir adds a touch of warmth to his style within the camp.

Inculcating insecurity or apprehension in the ranks usually doesn’t work for a long period in cricket teams; Gambhir will have to play his cards smartly to bring a football style iron-hand to cricket even if he feels that’s the need of the hour in professionalising men with the propensity to wander in the garden.

Title: ‘We went undefeated despite losing all five tosses’: Rohit Sharma reacts to India’s unbeaten run in Champions Trophy

Content:
The Indian team on Sunday went the whole mile in the Champions Trophy as an undefeated unit after they defeated New Zealand in the final in Dubai. Reacting to the unbeaten streak, skipper Rohit Sharma lauded the team and said it was a pretty special feat to boast of an unblemished record in such an important tournament.
“We went undefeated despite losing all five tosses. Yet, we still won the trophy. Across the five matches we played, we didn’t lose a single one. Winning a tournament without a single defeat is a massive achievement in itself, and it gives me immense satisfaction. To be honest, until we won the trophy, no one really thought about it. But after the victory, it hit us—we had gone through the entire tournament undefeated. That realization made it even more special. It’s difficult to put into words how that feels right now,” the captain said in an exclusive interaction with JioHotstar.
“We have an incredibly solid team, and it’s a joy to play alongside such committed individuals. Everyone knows their role and responsibilities. Of course, emotions run high on the field. Sometimes, I get a bit carried away, but it’s all in the spirit of the game. The words exchanged on the ground aren’t meant to hurt anyone or show off—they are just an expression of our passion. At the end of the day, our main goal is to win, and we are ready to do whatever it takes to achieve that,” he added.

Sunday’s Champions Trophy triumph helped India break the tie with Australia with a record third Champions Trophy title, adding onto the wins in 2002 (shared with Sri Lanka) and 2013. The win comes only eight months after Rohit led the Men in Blue to their second T20 World Cup title in Barbados. Starting with the 2023 ODI World Cup, India have now played 23 matches in three successive ICC limited-overs events, bearing a solitary loss in the CWC final against Australia.

Title: Varun Chakravarthy makes ‘distance’ joke as he poses with Champions Trophy silverware

Content:
Varun Chakravarthy, who played a vital part in India’s triumphant Champions Trophy campaign by taking 2 wickets in the final against New Zealand, posted some photos with the silverware with an interesting caption. “A lot of distance was travelled to get a taste of this Cup !!,” he posted on Instagram with two winking emojis.
The caption appeared to take a cheeky dig at the people who suggested that India had an unfair advantage in the Champions Trophy, having all their matches in Dubai while other teams had to travel from Pakistan to the UAE.
After the second semifinal, South Africa’s David Miller, lashed out at the ICC over scheduling after the Proteas were knocked out of the tournament following a 50-run loss to New Zealand on Wednesday.

A post shared by Varun Chakaravarthy (@chakaravarthyvarun)
The schedule of the Champions Trophy led both Australia and South Africa to travel to Dubai from Pakistan after the group stage to prepare for the potential semi-final clash against India.
But when the Rohit Sharma men beat the Kiwis in their last group game, setting up a semi-final clash with Australia, the South African team had to fly back to Pakistan for their semi-final match against New Zealand.
“It’s only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,” Miller had said after South Africa’s exit from the tournament. The South African team left for Dubai from Karachi on Sunday afternoon and was back in Lahore on Monday.

South African top-order batter Rassie van der Dussen and former Australia skipper Pat Cummins, had also said India are in an advantageous position as they have played all their games at one venue while other teams have had to travel to different venues in Pakistan.

Title: Why did Team India wear white jackets after winning Champions Trophy?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-white-jackets-winning-champions-trophy-significance-9879079/
Content:
The Indian team clinched their third Champions Trophy when they defeated New Zealand in the final of the tournament in Dubai on Sunday. At the trophy presentation, each team member had to wear a white jacket before holding the prize aloft. So why do teams who have won the Champions Trophy since 2009 have to adorn a white blazer? We explain:
The white jackets symbolize the ultimate measure of greatness and determination, according to the International Cricket Council. It is a badge of honour adorned by champions and embody the relentless pursuit for tactical brilliance, and a legacy that inspires generations. Winning the white jacket signifies the journey of putting it all on the line for victory, ICC stated.
“The ICC Men’s Champions Trophy represents the best of the best and the unveiling of the white jacket, which symbolizes greatness, will now build the excitement of the event across the global cricket community,” Pakistan great Wasim Akram had revealed in the promo video of the Champions Trophy.
In the match on Sunday, skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front with an excellent half-century as a resolute India held their nerve to win an unprecedented third Champions Trophy title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand.
Bowling first after Rohit lost his 12th straight toss, India’s spinners restricted New Zealand to 251 for seven in the allotted 50 overs, with Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/45) making significant contributions with the ball.
India completed the chase of 252 with six balls to spare after Rohit (76 off 83 balls) and Shreyas Iyer (48 off 62 balls) shone with the bat.

For New Zealand, Daryl Mitchell (63 off 101 balls), Michael Bracewell (53 not out off 40 balls), and Rachin Ravindra (37 off 29 balls) were the main contributors with the willow.

Title: Kuldeep Yadav on Rohit Sharma’s captaincy: ‘It’s very difficult to manage four spinners and the way he managed was amazing’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kuldeep-yadav-on-rohit-sharmas-captaincy-its-very-difficult-to-manage-four-spinners-and-the-way-he-managed-was-amazing-9878932/
Content:
Kuldeep Yadav on Sunday showered praise on Rohit Sharma’s captaincy for the way he managed all the four spinners in the Champions Trophy. India’s spin quartet of Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel played a pivotal role in India’s triumph in Champions Trophy in Dubai.
“It’s very difficult to manage four spinners and the way he managed, it was amazing to see,” Kuldeep told Sky Sports Cricket.
“When four spinners are playing together, it is very hard to rotate any of them. Obviously the planning was going on, we played our last game in Dubai on March 4 and we got plenty, like four or five days of break and then we had a chat how we go about this game.
“The plan for me and Varun was to bowl to the new batter. We wanted to finish Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel’s over before Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell come to bat,” he said.
Varun Chakravarthy (2/45) provided the breakthrough for India by trapping Young lbw in the eighth over. Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) bowled Rachin Ravindra with a googly in the 11th over. Kuldeep then accepted an easy return catch off Kane Williamson (11), a prized wicket for India.
Kuldeep explained how bowling in tandem with the fellow spinners has helped him during the tournament.
“I’ve been bowling with Varun from last five or six years, you know, we were part of KKR. He had a fantastic domestic season and then he played T20Is for India, he has been brilliant,” he said.
Kuldeep also revealed the role he was given by captain Rohit Sharma. He said: “In the last game when Head was batting, he (Rohit Sharma) thought probably I was the better option against him and he wanted me to bowl and get him out. If he could have hit for a couple of sixes, he was fine with it. Today obviously Varun got the first wicket of Will Young and I bowled in the 11th over. I mean, Rachin was batting really well. It was the planning, to be very honest.”
When coaxed about does Rohit ever say it’s okay if he go for runs just get me wickets, Kuldeep said:  “100 per cent, because he believes that I’m an attacking spinner and he wants me to create some magic on the field. He wants me to take wickets in the middle overs.”

Title: ‘I just wish Rohit Sharma had won this in Lahore’: Ajay Jadeja on India’s Champions Trophy 2025 triumph
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/just-wish-india-had-won-this-in-lahore-ajay-jadeja-champions-trophy-triumph-9878706/
Content:
Former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja said had India won the Champions Trophy in Pakistan, it would have been an even more special win, beyond just the sports for the Men in Blue.
India beat New Zealand in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 at the Dubai International Ground on Sunday night and speaking on the Dressing Room show, the former India captain, Jadeja said, “I was just wishing that if India had won this in Lahore, it would’ve been even better. It would’ve been a victory beyond just the sport.”
He also praised all the fans around the world for turning up for the global tournament.
“Shoutout to the fans as well because every player that I’ve talked to who’s been there, they’ve enjoyed being there. The people of Pakistan have also come out in numbers. Their team didn’t do as well as they would’ve liked, but they’ve still kept that thing, and it’s been a happy moment and a great tournament,” he added.
Meanwhile, swing king Wasim Akram also heaped praises on the Indian team and said this ‘team would have won anywhere in the world’.
“This Indian team would have won it anywhere in the world. Yes, there were a lot of talks, but once decided that India would play all of their matches in Dubai and had they played in Pakistan, they would have won there as well. They won the 2024 T20 World Cup without losing a game, they went on to win the Champions Trophy without losing even one game which shows the depth in their cricket, that shows the leadership,” Akram said.
“If you remember they lost to New Zealand 3-0 in Test series at home, lost the Border-Gavaskar trophy and lost the series in Sri Lanka so they were under pressure to remove the captain, the coach… but sanity prevailed. BCCI backed them, said this is our captain, this is our coach and now they are the champions of the champion,” he added.

Content:
Axar Patel has lauded Hardik Pandya’s confidence after India’s Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai on Sunday. India registered a four-wicket victory over New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Stadium.
“Jab hum sabki fatt jati hain, tab Hardik Pandya sabse jyada confident hota hain (When we’re all under pressure, Hardik Pandya is the most confident guy),” Axar told Star Sports.
Axar Patel also lauded the coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma for their decision making throughout the tournament.
“I believe that the decision taken by the captain (Rohit Sharma) and the coach (Gautam Gambhir) was made after a lot of thought, and today, when the results are in, it is truly a cause for celebration,” he said.
“Aur kaptani ki baat kare to obviously unko pata hai ke kis player ko kahan pe use krna hai aur wo hi ek ache kaptaan ki khaasiyat hoti hai. Haat me trophy hai usse zyada kaptaani ki kya tareef kare. 2 baar ICC me lagatar champion bana diya hai (And when it comes to captaincy, he (Rohit) knows exactly where to use each player – that is the hallmark of a great captain. With the trophy in hand, what more can one say about his captaincy? He has led the team to become ICC champions consecutively),” he added.
Axar has also explained the reason why India picked five spinners for the Champions Trophy.
“When we were coming to the tournament, everyone felt that we had too many spinners, and there was even talk that we had 4-5 spinners, why do we need so many spinners.
“But today, when you look at the results, and even after the first two matches, everyone must have realized how important that decision was.”

Title: Hardik Pandya on India not travelling to Pakistan: ‘This is way above my pay grade’

Content:
Hardik Pandya has revealed the reason behind the success of the current Indian team and also explained how tough times have made him battle-ready.
“This team enjoys each other’s company and success. It is not an individually driven team. It’s Team India,” he told reporters.
“We all believe that everyone can finish the game or do something magical. We have all come together for one goal; if you score zero, it doesn’t matter as long as the team is winning.”
The Indian all-rounder also thanked the fans in Pakistan and addressed the query about India not traveling to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. He said, “I am sure Pakistani people living in Dubai must have enjoyed our performance. The question of why we didn’t go is way above my pay grade.”
On his playing style, Hardik said he only plays to win.
“I have always played cricket to win. This is not just a dialogue.
“I have always put the team above myself. It doesn’t matter if Hardik Pandya does well or not, but the team must do well. This mindset has helped me face hardships and taught me not to run away from challenges.
“If challenges are tough, throw punches. Keep fighting. Don’t leave the battlefield. If you give up, you won’t learn and grow.
“It’s like fielding; if you dive, you will be able to stop the ball. If you don’t, you will never understand the outcome.”
Hardik has played the role of India’s second seam bowler in the tournament. On his bowling, Pandya said, “Lately, bowling has become very close to my heart. If Hardik Pandya is bowling, then I don’t have to worry about my batting. My bowling takes care of my batting.”
When asked about his six-hitting prowess, he said, “I have liked hitting sixes since I was 14 years old. But back then, I didn’t have the strength. Now I have the power. The years of hard work are paying off at the right time.”
Pandya also reflected on the 2017 Champions Trophy loss against arch-rivals Pakistan in the final. He said, “Now that we have won, I can say that I have avenged that 2017 final loss. But eight years is a long time; a lot has happened. For me, India’s win is important. Fans back home are happy; this is the best we can offer from our side.”

Title: ‘I’m either a hero or a zero’: Ravindra Jadeja after hitting the winning runs in Champions Trophy final vs New Zealand

Team India star all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja said that he bats at a position in One-Day cricket where he gets a chance to become ‘either a hero or a zero’ after Men In Blue’s emphatic win over New Zealand on Sunday.
India thumped the Kiwis by four wickets in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium to lift their second ICC trophy in as many years. India also won the T20 World Cup 2024 in the USA and the West Indies and this cup is India’s first ODI major trophy in the last 12 years after the 2013 Champions Trophy win.
“Mera number aisa hai ki kabhi hero ya kabhi zero banane ka chance hota hai (My batting number is such that I’m either a hero or a zero at the end of the game). Luckily, Hardik and KL batted really well in the last 10 overs and stitched a crucial partnership. It was not easy to score runs in the middle but credit goes to both of them as they took a lot of pressure from us,” said Jadeja to broadcasters after the win.
A moment of pure joy for #RavindraJadeja! 🏆💙
He expresses his pride in the team and what it feels like to win the tournament! 🙏🔥#ChampionsTrophyOnJioStar #Cricket pic.twitter.com/Jp0Xx0Do7b

On being asked what this title means to him, Jadeja responded, “this is a massive moment for me. It takes a lot of pride to win a big tournament for India. Luckily, we have won two back to back ICC Trophies and we are really happy with it.”
Chasing 251, India got off to a strong start but New Zealand fought back valiantly, taking the contest deep. It was the combined effort from the middle order consisting of Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya, which helped India close the game. Jadeja hit the winning runs as India lifted their second Champions Trophy.

Content:
Harry Brook has pulled out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the second season running, citing the need to prepare for his commitments with the national team. Harry Brook was bought by Delhi Capitals for Rs 6.25 Crore in the mega auction in November.
“I have made the very difficult decision to pull out of the upcoming IPL,” Brook said in a statement.
“I apologise unreservedly to the Delhi Capitals and their supporters. I love cricket. Ever since I was a young boy, I have dreamt of playing for my country, and I am extremely thankful to have the opportunity to play the game I love at this level.
“With the guidance of people I trust, I have taken the time to seriously consider this decision. It is a really important time for England cricket, and I want to fully commit to preparing for the upcoming series. In order to do this, I need time to recharge after the busiest period in my career to date.
“I know not everyone will understand, and I don’t expect them to, but I have to do what I believe is right, and playing for my country remains my priority and focus. I remain hugely grateful for the opportunities I have been given and the support I receive.”
Brook’s decision might not sit well with the Delhi Capitals, who had re-signed him after he pulled out last year, following the death of his grandmother.
The England middle-order batter is set to face a two-year ban from the IPL.
According to a new rule introduced by the IPL, “Any player who registers in the player auction and after getting picked at the auction, makes himself unavailable before the start of the season, will get banned from participating in the tournament and player auction for 2 Seasons.”
The competition’s only exception is for “an injury/medical condition, which will have to be confirmed by the player’s home board”.

Content:
Former Pakistan cricketers Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar expressed their disappointment due to the absence of Pakistani representation in the presentation ceremony of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final in Dubai.
On Sunday, Rohit Sharma-led team India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the final to lift their first 50-over ICC title in 12 years at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
There was no one from PCB or Pakistan’s cricket official presence in any form for the Champions Trophy final despite Pakistan being the host.
“As far as I know, Chairman Saab (PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi) wasn’t well but the people that came from there (PCB) were Sumair Ahmad Syed (Chief Operating Officer of PCB) and Usman Wahla (Director of International for PCB) but no one was there on the stage,” said a fairly disappointed Akram on the Dressing Room show after the event.
“We were the host, weren’t we right? How come even the COO of PCB or whoever it may be who was representing Chairman Saab, why weren’t they on stage? Were they not invited? I don’t know what is the story. It definitely looked odd to me while sitting here. Pakistani, koi na koi stage par khada hona bahot jaruri tha. Chahe wo cup na de, chahe wo medal na de but somebody should’ve been there. (It was imperative that Pakistan should have had representation in any form.),” added Akram.
This is literally beyond my understanding.
How can this be done???#championstrophy2025 pic.twitter.com/CPIUgevFj9
— Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) March 9, 2025
Akhtar, meanwhile took to X, formerly Twitter to show his dismay. He said, “India have won the ICC Champions Trophy. There was one odd thing: no one from the Pakistan Cricket Board during the presentation ceremony. Pakistan were the host of the Champions Trophy, but there was no representative of Pakistan who was standing. No one was there to present the trophy. It is beyond me. Think about it. The tournament was hosted by us, but there was nobody there. Feeling very down to see that.”
Jay Shah, the chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC), gave the Champions Trophy to the victorious captain, Rohit. Roger Binny, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief, presented the champions’ white blazers. Devajit Saikia, BCCI secretary, was among the other dignitaries on stage.
India did not travel to the host country Pakistan, citing security reasons and played all its group games, the semi-final and the final, in Dubai.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy – How Shreyas Iyer & KL Rahul, played their contrasting roles to perfection in landmark Indian triumph
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-how-shreyas-iyer-kl-rahul-played-their-contrasting-roles-to-perfection-in-landmark-indian-triumph-9878140/
Content:
KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer are two cricketers, in absolute contrast to each other, who have been immensely vital to India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph. Both have their detractors, but without them this win wouldn’t have been possible.
Even in the final, their contrasting approaches stood out but entirely in character – Shreyas taking a couple of risks that would have got him out, and Rahul going the other way by eschewing risks altogether. But the truth is that both played their roles to perfection.
Shreyas, who doesn’t take risks and doesn’t counterattack, is of no use to this Indian team; else he would be Rahul. Rahul who doesn’t avoid risks is of no use to this Indian team; else he would be Shreyas.
When Shreyas charged out and nearly holed out to deep midwicket – it just about crept over the rope for six with a desperate Will Young trying his best to haul it back – that exactly was his job description. Stun the opponents with chutzpah. When Rahul looked aghast at Axar Patel, who had thrown his wicket away, with such utter disappointment – almost betrayal – that suggested ‘why?!’, it was entirely in character.
That’s the best thing about both players – they stay in character and rarely stray from that.
And to think Shreyas once nearly gave up cricket in his teenage days because he wasn’t selected for a Mumbai under-age tournament. A few years back, we were at his parents’ home in a Mumbai suburb where he grew up, and it was his mother Rohini who brought that moment up, dragging her husband Santosh in the conversation.
“You remember Santosh, he came and sat on that same couch (pointing at the one we’re sitting on). He was about to cry,” Rohini said. The father couldn’t help himself but carry on with the theme, and said he even suggested to Shreyas that he can stop playing cricket.
“But he got angry and said, ‘Papa, how can you even say that?’” Santosh recalled. It was then that Santosh took matters into his own hands, opting to take him to a sports psychologist, Mugdha Bavare. The teenager stabilised, got back his love for the game and plunged himself back into cricket.
Similarly, Rahul had his moment at a television show hosted by director Karan Johar, where he became the collateral damage along with Hardik Pandya. When Pandya’s childhood coach Jitender Singh had reached Hardik’s home at 7.30 am after he was sent back from Australia post the controversy, he found Hardik sitting on a sofa with his sunglasses on.
“He hadn’t slept the whole night, na?,” the coach asked another person in the room. “Tension nahin lena hai (Don’t take tension). You will get back to playing for India very soon. Jo ho gaya, voh ho gaya (what’s done is done), no use worrying about it. Come tomorrow to Reliance Stadium. Now, smile.” His life turned around the next day.
Rahul, meanwhile, handled it differently. His friend – a former Karnataka teammate David Matthias – once told this newspaper about his meeting with Rahul after he was banned by the BCCI for that Johar show. “I remember I met him the day after that. We didn’t chat about it at all. We have an unfiltered relationship – share everything really that upsets or excites us. That didn’t feature much. Mothers of our friends did say, ‘Oh Rahul, was such a good boy in that!’ I like Hardik too. He is a good human, a genuine guy. The only thing KL told me is from now on, if anyone asks you to recount any funny stories about me, tell them you have plenty but none to share!”
Thus far in this tournament, just as he had done in the 2023 ODI World Cup, Shreyas kept counterattacking. Unlike that tournament where he failed in the final, he had his moment of redemption in this final. He attacked, counterattacked, and also once he realised he was perilously close to combusting, he adjusted.
Once Rohit fell, especially in the manner he did, the pressure fell on Shreyas. A phase of tuk-tuk followed but it would have been apparent to anyone who watched it that it was against his character, his game.
He tried. Until he couldn’t hold himself back and charged out to nearly hole out to deep midwicket. The difference is the fans would have fretted and even abused him for that shot that nearly wasn’t a six- but in his mind he played it because he thought it could be the six that turned the game.
Where does the truth lie? Did he undersell himself? Didn’t he value his own wicket? Did he misread the situation? All those questions are valid but it could only be answered in affirmative a year from now. By then, his wicket would be so valuable that he can’t afford this discretion perhaps.
Right now, he has the license – in fact that’s his job. In fact, it can be argued that if he plays his cards well – and more importantly, he has the backing of the coach and the captain – he can even continue this for a short while yet. Soon, the responsibility will fall on his shoulders and it would be disappointing if he continues to take chances – but that’s in the future.
Similarly, it would be disappointing if Rahul tries to take undue risks to try and put pressure on the opponents. That’s not his game, as yet for India. In the IPL, yes, but not for India. The roles are clearly defined.
Rahul’s parents are stable individuals who presumably understand his career path. In real life, Rahul prefers to climb out of batting pits through calm and composure.
“That’s how he has been all his life. You should see his parents – solid, intelligent (both professors) and calmer than Rahul even. He gets it from them. Doesn’t get flustered much at all,” Mathais said to this newspaper.
Contrast this with Shreyas’s parents. Here is his father about watching him bat: “Aiyo, I can’t handle it. I think I need to see a doctor for this. I cannot even sit till he’s crossed three figures. And she’s worse, usko dekh ke mujhe aur darr lagta hai (pointing at his wife). Since she doesn’t drink, I ask her to always sit with a glass of water to combat her nerves,” says Santosh.
But in all that apparent pressure, there is humour in Shreyas’s household that presumably helps him hold his nerve. “He will walk into the kitchen and say, ‘Mummy, kya bigad rahe ho?‘ And once he brought home my favourite stray dog and said ‘lo aaj ka dinner, isko cook karo,’” recalls the parents.
Two characters who have been much criticised, even abused by general cricket fans, stayed true to their character – and did what the team demanded of them – to ensure India won the Champions Trophy.

Title: Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma confirms he’s not going anywhere, proud of India being a ‘bloody good team’

At the end of a 20-minute press conference where Rohit Sharma addressed the questions with the trophy by his side, he paused and made a final statement: “One more thing… I’m not going to retire from the format, just to make sure that no rumours are spread moving forward. Thank you so much.” India defeated New Zealand in a nervy Champions Trophy final, and Rohit’s side made it back-to-back ICC titles.
The Champions Trophy came on the back of an international season that saw India lose the Test series to New Zealand at home and then in Australia, where Rohit dropped himself for the last Test. Speculations have been rife about his future since then. But through the course of this unbeaten Champions Trophy campaign, Rohit has gone about showing he still has enough gas in the tank. And in the final, he finished with a match-winning knock of 76 that wonderfully set up the chase for India.
His future in the ODIs aside, as Rohit sat down for the press conference, he appeared every bit a proud captain. He attributed it to the collective effort of the side, where everyone has put their hand up and has ticked their roles to perfection. “If you want to win a tournament championship, it is very important for everyone to contribute. There are some matches where individuals win, but to win a tournament, everyone needs to perform together. In this tournament, we have seen that from the first match till now, all the boys have contributed. If you see from number 1 to 11, the boys who have got the chance to bat or bowl, they have contributed in their own way.”
Coming into the tournament, India took the big decision to demote KL Rahul from No 5 to 6 and the wicketkeeper responded by staying unbeaten in three of the tricky chases to guide them home including the final against New Zealand on Sunday. “When we discussed about KL’s batting position, we discussed quite deeply how calm he is when he is batting. The pressure doesn’t get to him. We wanted that calmness in the middle somewhere. Also, we wanted to use a left-hander in the middle. That actually worked out both ways for us. KL has been doing a lot of challenging work for the team for so many years now. I am very happy with how he managed to pull this tournament and bat it in the pressure situation, both in the semifinals and this game as well. The contribution may not be 70-80, but those 30-40s are very important,” Rohit added.
On Sunday when Rahul walked in, India were once again in a spot of bother. But like he did against Australia, he took the calculative risks by attacking the spinners, which he again did here to keep the required run rate in check. “When you are chasing, running the ball at the back end, it can get tough, it can get difficult. But with KL being there, we know that he has got that mind where he keeps himself calm and keeps the dressing room also very calm. So, I am very happy with how he managed in this tournament and really happy for the contributions that he made for the team,” Rohit said.
Since their defeat to England in the semifinals of the T20 World Cup in 2022, India have gone about with a different approach in white-ball cricket. With Rohit leading the way at the top with his aggressive intent, India’s high-risk approach has paid off in each of the last three ICC tournaments where they have made it to as many finals. “Someone was telling me in these ICC tournaments, we have lost only one game in the last three ICC tournaments that we have played. So, it is a great milestone to have, honestly speaking. And that speaks about the kind of team this is. So, I know we did not win the World Cup. We lost that final. But then we went to World 20 and not lost a single game and went on to win the trophy and here as well. So, it shows a lot of quality in the team, a lot of depth, a lot of understanding within the group, a lot of enjoyment, a lot of excitement. And that is how we want to play our cricket. And that is what we had spoken before the tournament began. We wanted to enjoy,” he added.
Another statement stood during the press conference too, as he spoke about the recent successes of his team: “India is a bloody good team.”

Title: Rohit’s redemption: From sitting out in Sydney to standing tall in Dubai
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohits-redemption-from-sitting-out-in-sydney-to-standing-tall-in-dubai-9878103/
Content:
AS THE Indians got busy posing with the ICC Champions Trophy, skipper Rohit Sharma would quietly emerge out of the smog, walk to the middle of the pitch, uproot one of the stumps and have a short dandiya jig with Virat Kohli. Unlike in Barbados last year when India won the T20 World Cup, where he struggled to hold back tears, here he would hug his longtime teammate with a huge grin.
In a matter of months, Rohit’s fortunes have taken a dramatic turn. At the start of the year, when Rohit dropped himself for the Sydney Test after a string of low scores, his future in the team was in question. There were doubts whether he would even lead the team here. But here he was, putting the team once again on the podium holding a trophy aloft. A T20 World Cup title eight months ago in the Caribbean and now the Champions Trophy puts Rohit just one step below M S Dhoni as the most successful Indian captain in ICC events.
With speculation about his international future and the possibility of him walking away from the ODI format on a high, Rohit would end the press conference with a disclaimer for anyone who had doubts about his future. “One more thing, I am not going to retire from this format… just to make sure that no rumours are spread, moving forward. Ok guys? Thank you so much.”
After a lean recent patch, the triumph here has given him a shot in the arm. Rohit missed a chance to do it all by himself on the night and had to overcome a roller-coaster ride that would have definitely set some jitters in the dressing room. When he sat and watched Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel get out, he would have cursed himself and his dismissal would have kept playing endlessly in his mind.
Rohit got out going for a big shot against left-arm spinner Rachin Ravindra when the Kiwis had started getting a stranglehold on proceedings. He had taken his foot off the pedal a bit after a rollicking start. On another occasion, the manner of his dismissal would have disappointed the batsman, but not Rohit who has been taking on an aggressive role at the top of the order in the last few years.
“It is not natural to me but it is something I really wanted to do, when you are trying something different, you need the backing of the team and they were with me, Rahul (Dravid) bhai in the 2023 World Cup and now with Gauti (Gautam Gambhir) bhai. I have played all these years in a different style. I wanted to see if we can get results by playing differently. It makes it easier and gives you that freedom, that’s why I wanted that batting depth. Jadeja coming at 8 gives you that confidence to go hard. If it comes off it comes off. Most important thing is that I am clear in my mind,” Rohit said.
When Rohit trudged back with his head down in the 27th over, it felt Ahmedabad 2023 all over again. Like that afternoon on November 19, he was in the middle of something special before he brought about his own downfall, bringing New Zealand back into the game. However, this time it was a happy ending.
Up until that moment, the 76 he made was making India breathe easy. They had lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli in successive overs, but Rohit made them assured.
Chasing 252, he once again gave a typical, rapid start. Off the second ball of the night, he got off the mark by pulling Kyle Jamieson for a trademark six. Once he spotted the short length, he stood tall and picked the spot to deposit it over square-leg. The transfer of weight from front to back foot was smooth. That shot got Rohit going — he hit five boundaries and three sixes — as he made 49 of the 64 runs India got in the first Powerplay.
When New Zealand brought on the spinners, he put his daring approach to bed while still taking command of the situation. When Glenn Phillips brought out an acrobatic effort to send back his opening partner Shubman Gill, followed by the dismissal of Virat Kohli an over later, it didn’t seem to bother him much.
It is what Rohit, the opener before the start of 2022, was so good at — constructing an innings, asserting himself fully before breaking free in the end. It is what fetched him a record three double centuries. On Sunday, he didn’t even get a hundred but his match-winning innings was far more significant — it ended India’s 50-over ICC event jinx and gave his career a second wind.

Title: Rohit Sharma says he’s ‘not going to retire from this format’ after India win Champions Trophy

India captain Rohit Sharma cleared the air on his rumoured retirement plans by telling journalists at the post-match press conference that he has no plans to retire.
“One more thing: I’m not going to retire from this format. Just to make sure that no rumours are spread moving forward,” Rohit Sharma said at the end of the press conference on Sunday after he had guided India to its third Champions Trophy title. Thanks to a 76 from him at the top of the innings, India chased down New Zealand’s 252-run target with an over to spare and four wickets in hand.
In the previous games, Rohit Sharma had been losing his wicket after getting starts for India as he tried to bully the opening bowlers of opposition teams. That approach clicked on Sunday in the final, when India needed it to work the most.

“I did the same thing today (as I did in previous games). I wanted to score in powerplay and once the field spreads out it becomes difficult. So you have to take chances at the top. I pick the bowlers and the spots to hit. You may not see consistency in terms of scores, but I know what I’m doing. I changed my game after 10 overs. But when the team wins you feel happy. In 2019 World Cup I had a good run but we didn’t win the title. It didn’t make me happy,” Rohit said at the press conference.
Earlier at the post-match presentation, Rohit had also spoken about his approach.
“It’s not natural to me (batting aggressively in the last two ICC ODI events) but it’s something I wanted to do. When you’re trying something different, you need the team’s and management’s backing, which I had. During the ODI World Cup, I spoke to Rahul bhai about it, and he was supportive, as is Gauti bhai now. It’s about getting that backing from the team and management. Having the batting depth makes it much easier and gives me freedom. The results won’t always be consistent, but it’s fine as long as it serves the team’s purpose.”

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Redemption for KL Rahul as crucial innings eases pain of World Cup final

He appeared calm on the outside right through his innings, but in a lighter moment after India won the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, KL Rahul had time for a joke.
“I don’t think I should say this on camera, but I was sh***ng myself at the end there,” Rahul told Simon Doull. The wicketkeeper-batsman, however, was solid once again in a run-chase, finishing unbeaten on 34 off 33 balls as India won back-to-back ICC titles in Dubai on Sunday.
“I was confident we could win. In moments like these, in big games, it’s about holding your composure. We all know that’s not easy, but I’m happy we won and got over the line this time. I have batted in situations like this in three of the five games. The games have given me good time in the middle and good preparation for big moments like this,” Rahul said.
His tally of 136 runs in the tournament won’t win him many awards but his importance to India in the middle order was immense. “He has a very solid mind and never gets overwhelmed by pressure. That’s one reason we wanted him in the middle phase to finish the game for us. His experience and calmness while batting allow others, like Hardik, to play freely,” captain Rohit Sharma said after the match.
It’s not easy being KL Rahul, mind you. As he said after the semifinal, every time India take a break from ODIs and return to play, there seems to be a question mark around his place despite delivering what he has been asked to do. He had added that skipper Rohit Sharma and the management understand what he brings to the team, and that was evident in his two unbeaten knocks in the knockout matches of the tournament.
“It’s never easy for anyone in the team to be moving in different places. But that’s how the game goes. Whatever the team thinks is the best possible combination and what they feel is the best entry point for a player, you leave it up to the team to decide and just try and do your job. That’s what I’m focusing on,” Rahul had said in a press conference earlier.
In the semifinal against Australia, he finished unbeaten on 42 but more than that, was ready to take on the role of the aggressor to take pressure off Virat Kohli who was approaching a century. Even in the final, just as the catch was taken, just like he did when Kohli fell on Tuesday, Rahul turned towards Axar Patel and mumbled out some words with an expression that said: why?
But Rahul once again ensured he was in the middle when Ravindra Jadeja hit the winning runs.
“KL Rahul has immense talent, I don’t think anyone can hit the ball as well as he can,” his friend Hardik Pandya said at the end.
November 19, 2023 was a difficult night for the entire Indian squad as Australia clinched the World Cup. But it was especially tough for Rahul, who himself was left wondering – as he revealed to R Ashwin later – whether he made an error with his innings that day in Ahmedabad, in two minds about taking down Mitchell Starc. March 9, 2025 will go some way in easing his heartache.

Title: Virat Kohli, the master sculptor who shaped India’s Champions Trophy triumph — and earned redemption
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-master-sculptor-india-champions-trophy-triumph-9877768/
Content:
Virat Kohli had just sought a review. But, his eyes hollow, he knew the irrevocable fate of his. Kohli grimaced, shook his head in angst and stared ruefully at the twilight skies. The day was not to be his, yet in a larger sense, the day was his too.
After 12 years, he felt the lustre of the Champions Trophy. In this span, he had endured several nearly moments, teary nights when he left the stadium with a heavy heart of losses and spent the night sleepless on his bed. But this night in Dubai, he would sleep peacefully, probably cuddling the trophy’s replica. The aberration in the final, this was a tournament the master sculptor has helped chiselling.
Donning a titular role in winning an ICC trophy has been like a revolver pointed at his head. He has conquered everything a cricketer could possibly do — love and adulation, respect and riches, countless trophies and individual milestones. In fact, he has won too much; everything cricketing-kind could offer him, the WTC mace aside. But an immensely proud cricketer, he doesn’t want to be seen wilting under pressure in big matches, as someone bereft of the mysterious inner quality that separates winners from losers, in a format he loves the most.
Even if he were to lose, it would not tarnish his greatness. It’s a stretch to read one failure as an emblem of his entire international career. It would not be seen as his destiny or duty. He has won cricket’s equivalent of a Nobel and Oscar. So what would missing out on a Goldsmiths Prize or Filmfare mean to him? But sport is full of paradoxes. Sometimes its most irrelevant moments are also its most eloquent.
Long, he had suffered the Sachin Tendulkar syndrome. In their time, both reigned as the undisputed monarchs in this format. The hundreds, the runs, reward cheques and statistical nuggets piled, a halo blazed, records tumbled, yet their careers felt incomplete, missing that one step that could make them the game’s immortal.
A pang lurked inside them for all the individual glory, that they couldn’t influence knockouts as much as they would have desired, as much as their outsized talents would have deserved. Something went awry in clutch games. Before the final, his scores in knockout read thus: 24, 9, 35, 58 not out, 43, 3, 1, 5, 1, 117, 54. Not utterly trivial numbers for most cricketers, but irrefutably for Kohli.
His impact and numbers, non-knockouts aside, have been incredible.
Only Tendulkar is ahead of him, by a meagre margin of 178 runs. But the knockout anomaly could have haunted him. In 2024, he finally kissed the T20 crown after stacking a load of runs in every edition. In 2025, he was thirsting for the Champions Trophy. Unlike Tendulkar who waited for a lifetime, 22 years, to finally touch the World Cup, Kohli achieved it in his second year. Two years later, he caressed the Champions Trophy.
But this was before Kohli became Kohli, before he began conquering batting peaks. There was Tendulkar and Dhoni. There is Rohit now too. But Kohli would always be the figurehead. He is stoked by such vaulting ambition that he would have wanted to win one of his own. The wait seemed interminable, and often, cursed. He tasted the sting of defeats in five finals across formats. Thrice, he left fuming after exits in the semifinal stage. The reunion with trophies seemed an impossible dream when he plummeted to depths of depression during the pandemic years.
Maybe, it was the vision of winning trophies that fuelled him to compose a stirring comeback. There have been times when the weight of a nation’s febrile hopes and dreams appeared too great a burden for him. It made him anxious and sick with nerves. It made the fear of failure unbearable and the pain of defeat even worse. This time, perhaps, he wanted to win it for himself, unhindered by the crushing weight of the nation’s expectations.
He has reached that elevated stage of his career when the records, judgement and perceptions have stopped disturbing him. But Kohli loathes to lose. It’s the spirit that has blazed in the toughest times of his life, from breaking to the domestic side with the whimsy selection discretion to attending a Ranji match soon after setting his father’s funeral, from shedding junk to chisel out a flab-free physique and dousing the demons of England and the dervishes that inhabited his head in the pandemic years.
It could be a magic elixir that could give wings to his career. Perhaps it would resurrect his Test career, definitely give him another shot at the 2027 ODI World Cup, and add more streaks of light to his halo and more pages to the Kohli Myth.
It is a tournament he refused to lose. Throughout the series, he seemed to run on something extra — extra desire, resolve, and motivation.
He always wears emotions on his sleeves, the eyes are vivid, the facial muscles as relaxed and flexible as a character actor and the body language evocative. But even by his instinct for the dramatic, he has not shed so many variegated emotions in a single tournament. Against Australia, he thick-edged an aerial cover-drive, inside out, to third man. He slapped his right pad in anguish, hurled a cuss word at the skies, and shook his head. In the game against Pakistan, he stood on sunken knees and bent head after failing to clear the fine-leg fielder on the sweep. He rolled his eyes, because he could have nudged the ball a little squarer so that he could have fetched a four rather than a single.
There was the same bloody-mindedness and a fully embodied determination that he was not going to accept anything less from his time in the middle than a three-figure mark, that had symbolised his peak years.
He was brutal on himself when he edged or missed something outside the off-stump, the tragic flaw of his marvellous career that resurfaces and spooks him intermittently. The vulnerability is less pronounced in white-ball formats, but Kohli was livid with himself whenever an indiscretion or intemperance passed by.
It could be distinct formats, climes and bowlers, but the difference in his movements at the crease was discernible. The forward stride was definite, the transfer of weight smooth, the feet glided rather than moved, the judgement outside the off-stump precise and those travelled legs rediscovered its spark and zest.
He is no longer the captain; but on the field, he remains the leader. His energy remains unbridled, his involvement unfettered. He was at the core of every tactic. He was in the bowlers’ ears, or the fielders’ eye-line when they erred. A growl, a stare, he spoke a thousand words with his expressions alone.
It was, fundamentally, the conquest of his will. Physically, he is still an exemplary athletic specimen, capable of long hauls under the crushing sun, and his energy inexhaustible, neutralising the inevitable waning of reflexes as he ages.
But something in his mind seemed to have snapped that it restricted his freedom, distorted his judgement and pierced his impregnable strength of mind. Perhaps, the outside chatter of his waning form disturbed him, perhaps he could not reconcile with a less prolific phase of his career. Perhaps, the recurring susceptibility outside the off-stump was haranguing him; or that now he is a walking red-ball wicket, so much so a journeyman seamer could uproot his stumps in his Ranji comeback. Whatever the mental ghosts that spooked him, he has slain them in the tournament.

Each innings was the optimal response to the circumstances, the match situation and the attack. A master in his zen, with a supernatural awareness of angles and space, the mind processing the variables like a supercomputer. Perhaps, the tournament would resuscitate his red-ball career. But this much is certain: No one ever would bat like this again in this format, or even have the chance to be great like this, as the 50-over dissolves into irrelevance and inconsequential bilateral series. He is one of those extreme talents in every sport, those who seem to be operating within a bespoke little pocket of time and space. It’s only a curious fate he had to wait this long to define an ICC 50-over tournament.

Title: ‘When you leave, you want to leave the team in a better place’: Virat Kohli after Champions Trophy triumph

Content:
With a lot of speculations going around on his future, Virat Kohli indicated that he is going to stick around a little bit longer after India won a record 3rd Champions Trophy title defeating New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday.
“It’s been amazing, we wanted to bounce back after a tough Australian tour, and wanted to win a big tournament, so to win the Champions Trophy is amazing. So much talent in the dressing room, they’re trying to take their game further and we’re just happy to be of help. Sharing our experience and that’s what makes this Indian team so strong,” Kohli said.
With 218 runs in five innings, including a century against Pakistan and a match-winning fifty in semi-final against Australia, Kohli finished fifth on the batting charts of the tournament.
He also said that the squad India have currently are ready to take on the world for the next 8 years.
“Everyone has put up impactful performances, we’ve been part of an amazing team, the amount of work we’ve done in the practice sessions, it feels great (to win). When you leave, you want to leave the team in a better place, I feel we’ve a squad that’s ready to take on the world for the next 8 years,” Kohli said.
In the match, skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front with an excellent half-century as a resolute India held their nerve to win an unprecedented third Champions Trophy title with a four-wicket victory over New Zealand.
Bowling first after Rohit lost his 12th straight toss, India’s spinners restricted New Zealand to 251 for seven in the allotted 50 overs, with Kuldeep Yadav (2/40) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/45) making significant contributions with the ball.

India completed the chase of 252 with six balls to spare after Rohit (76 off 83 balls) and Shreyas Iyer (48 off 62 balls) shone with the bat.

Title: ‘I was s****ing myself’: KL Rahul after leading India’s Champions Trophy final chase

Content:
After sealing a second knockout chase within a week, India wicket-keeper KL Rahul admitted the pressure of a Champions Trophy final eventually got to him. After seeing out New Zealand in a 252-run chase with his unbeaten 34 off 33 deliveries, Rahul said that he “s*****g” himself out in the middle.
India went from a position of 183 for three to 203 for five before Rahul stepped up to quell the nerves and help India record their third Champions Trophy title.
“Not sure I can say this on air but I was s**** myself. As confident as I could be that I could get over the line. Keeping composure is all that matters, happy to have done it this time. I’ve batted in times like this in three out of the five games,” Rahul said in a post-match chat after India secured a four-wicket win.
Rahul was at the fore of India’s semi-final chase against Australia earlier this week. Chasing a record 265-run total, India had similarly slipped to 178 for four before Rahul’s nerveless unbeaten 42 helped India go past the world champions. Rahul then secured the victory with a six off Glenn Maxwell in the penultimate over.
“Hard to put in words, but the team has pure skill. The way we’ve all had to play cricket growing up, we faced pressure from the time we became professional cricketers. The BCCI have groomed all of them and we’ve challenging ourselves to get better,” Rahul said after being a part of an ICC title win for the first time in his career.
The 32-year-old Rahul had previously found himself under pressure and scrutiny to maintain his spot, especially after being demoted from his regular No. 5 spot to accomodate the left-handed Axar Patel.
“Honestly, I mean it’s since 2020 I’ve batted at No.5 and a lot of times people forget that that’s where I’ve been batting,” Rahul had said after the semi-final win. “And every time I perform in a series and then there’s a break from ODI series, ODI cricket and then we come back after four or five months there’s a question mark again about, ‘oh well will he play in the XI, where does he fit?’ and sometimes I’m sitting there thinking what more can I do. Everywhere that I’ve been asked to play I’ve played and I feel like I have performed my role,” remarked Rahul.

Title: Unbeaten and unputdownable: India win Champions Trophy

It would not be as iconic a parting shot as MS Dhoni’s six over midwicket on that famous night in Mumbai. But Ravindra Jadeja’s slap through square leg that wrapped up the Champions Trophy in Dubai, India’s first 50-over ICC title in 12 years, would long be remembered.
Emotions poured out—Jadeja plucked a stump and began shaking his legs, KL Rahul let out a shriek of joy and the euphoric teammates bounded out—as they surpassed the target of 252 with four wickets and six balls to spare, ending a long and frustrating wait for winning a global tournament in this format.
The end was frenetic, but there was little doubt that India would leave the city in tears. Even when they lost wickets in clusters—18 for three after the century-stand between Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma and later 20 for 2—there was never a fear that India would panic and crumble. When they lost Gill, Virat Kohli and Rohit in a trice, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel stitched 61 runs. When Shreyas and Axar departed, KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya guided the ship, when Hardik exited, Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja calmly dragged them ashore.
It would not dissolve the pain of losing the World Cup final, 15 months ago, but it reasserted that India is an indomitable proposition in the white-ball forms. India won the final as they won the tournament as a whole, with emphatic inevitability. The skills they demonstrated were high-class (barring catches), the depth is envious, stressed by the fact that every member in the final eleven produced at least one match-influencing performance over the course of the tournament
India not only beat every opponent, but did so with a ruthlessness reminiscent of Australia in the 2000s. The conditions favoured them, slow and sluggish surfaces, but they harnessed those with clinical efficiency. The spinners were at the heart of the victory, but seamers performed their duties admirably too. Mohammed Shami was the joint-highest wicket-taker with Varun Chakaravarthy. Harshit Rana starred in his two outings and Hardik Pandya produced probing spells upfront, in the middle overs and at the death.
Similarly, batting heroes sprung from everywhere. From Rohit to Pandya, contributions came from every one. Virat Kohli anchored chases with his usual relish; Rohit offered breakneck starts, Gill offered solidity; Shreyas enterprise; Rahul reeled out knocks that suited specific situations; and Axar exhibited clean-hitting instincts.
The golden boys, though, were the unique spin quartet. Two left-arm spinners, a left-arm wrist spinner and an unorthodox leg-spinner combined to produce a blockbuster performance. The magnificent four of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar, Varun and Kuldeep Yadav nabbed 26 wickets, most of them at critical junctures of the game, maintained a staggering economy rate of 4.5 runs an overs.
Even by India’s rich heritage of spinners and their reliance on them in the subcontinent, they have never fielded a more diverse group in limited-over history. Varun is a leg-spinner who relies on his dexterous fingers to make the ball behave differently. His basket of tricks—the leg-break, googly, the slider and carrom ball—are delivered with surgical precision in line and length. Whenever the match had seemed drifting from India’s grasp, Rohit would SOS him, and he would vindicate the captain’s faith. On Sunday, he made India’s first breakthrough, removing opener Will Young after a breezy stand with Rachin Ravindra. He returned to eject Glenn Phillips, just when New Zealand were looking to accelerate.

In variations, only Kuldeep matches him. Long touted as the future leader of India’s spin pack, his career had passed through ups and downs. But he has fully emerged, and made his variety even more dangerous with his discipline, relentlessness and clever change of pace. He exhibited his big-match temperament with the scalps of Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra, thus breaking the backbone of the Kiwis.
The left-arm orthodox pair inject control and thrift. Jadeja is always the batsmen, strangling them with his mastery of length, flat trajectory and stump-to-stump line. He hurries through his overs, giving little time for batsmen to size him up. Axar is not exactly a clone, he uses the angles cleverly and extracts skid odd the surface, ensuring that he is not a bowler batsmen release their pressure. New Zealand batsmen, like Bedouins caught in a desert storm, stood clueless, letting the storm pass by. In all, they conceded a lone six and four boundaries and accounted for a staggering 125 dot balls. So proficient they were that they masked a shoddy day on the field, where India dropped four catches.
The base set, the batsmen cruised past the target to assert India’s absolute mastery of the format.

India on Sunday ended a 12-year wait to clinch a record-extending third Champions Trophy title, beating New Zealand by 4 wickets in the CT 2025 final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
FOLLOW LIVE: IND vs NZ Champions Trophy Live Blog
Chasing a tricky 252-run target after being forced to field first by Mitchell Santner, India got off to a flying start on the back of captain Rohit Sharma’s turbo-charged half-century. The skipper smashed his fifty of the tournament in 41 balls, waltzing his way to the mark with three sixes and a string of fours after India got to their fastest team fifty of the tournament in only 7.1 overs. After the dismissals of  Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma’s departure on 76 helped New Zealand claw back into the game before crucial stands from Shreyas Iyer-Axar Patel and KL Rahul-Hardik Pandya put India back ahead.
India eventually sealed the nervy chase with Ravindra Jadeja hitting the winning runs in the penultimate over off pacer Will O’Rourke.
India’s CT, white-ball dominance
The win helped India break the tie with Australia with a record third Champions Trophy title, adding onto the wins in 2002 (shared with Sri Lanka) and 2013. The win comes only eight months after Rohit led the Men in Blue to their second T20 World Cup title in Barbados, continuing a superb run in ICC white-ball events. Starting with the 2023 ODI World Cup, India have now played 23 matches in three successive ICC limited-overs events, bearing a solitary loss in the CWC final againt Australia.
The Champions Trophy victory is also India’s seventh ICC title win since Kapil Dev’s ‘Devils’ clinched the 1983 World Cup at Lord’s. The team have now won two CWCs, three CTs and two T20 World Cups, following Australia’s record 10 titles. Rohit also became only the second Indian skipper after MS Dhoni to win multiple ICC trophies.

India won the event while playing all their matches in Dubai. They were the only unbeaten team in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Previously, India had won the Champions Trophy title twice: sharing it with Sri Lanka in 2002 and then winning the 2013 edition. India has also lost the final twice: to New Zealand in 2000 and then to arch-rivals Pakistan in 2017, which was the last time the event was held before this year.

Title: Three times Glenn Phillips flew in ICC Champions Trophy to take stunning catches – Rizwan, Kohli and Gill

IND vs NZ Final Champions Trophy 2025: “We kind of expect that from Glenn.” That was New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner reaction in the post-match presentation when he was asked about Glenn Phillips’ ability to take sensational catches on the cricket field. That sure maybe the case, but every time he pulled off a stunner during the ICC Champions Trophy, Phillips made jaws drop, even though it’s become habitual for him. If there is a cricketer in the world at the moment who can make it to a playing XI purely on his athleticism in the outfield, it is Phillips. The 28-year-old, who did gymnastics at school growing up, is also training to be a pilot. “I’ll probably fly for close to four or five hours most days,” Phillips, who has a flight simulator in his room, told BBC Sport. “The other day I did Bahrain to Dubai.Sometimes I’ll do Heathrow to Manchester, other days Auckland to Christchurch. It really depends on what is floating in my boat for the day.”
And boy can he fly. Here are three catches the flying Kiwi took during the tournament.

A chase that was placed well and going at brisk pace was halted and it was halted by a flying beauty from none other than the superman Phillips. As Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill moved along swiftly in the chase, NZ needed something special and Phillips did exactly that. He plucked a catch out of thin air, from behind his head, to dismiss Gill off Mitchell Santner. It was a flighted ball which was drilled towards cover by Gill but Phillips’ jump in the air came as divine intervention. His reaction time was 0.78 seconds.
The catch was a photographer’s delight, an acrobat’s arch as  Phillips was like a silk ribbon caught in breeze, absolutely fluid. The 28-year-old has made it a habit now, displaying acrobatic skills on the field, day in and day out. His celebration was pretty down-to-earth though: crossing his hands and feet, while still sitting on the ground, and a happy smile pasted on his face. Not smug. Just content.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
Before the match last Sunday against India, Phillips was asked in the press conference about his incredible catching skills. A reporter wondered: ‘Any particular glue stick you use?’ Philllips’ response was typically understated: “I think a great deal of luck comes involved. I wish I could say that I’ve got a special little glue tag that I use, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. If anything, my palms are more sweaty than anything else. Obviously comes down to a lot of hard work and doing the basics as much as I can and then sometimes luck just plays a good part in it.” There was no luck here, just pure skill as Phillips flung himself to his right and completed a catch that left Virat Kohli standing in disbelief.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
In the tournament opener in Karachi, Phillips had already made his impact lower down the order with the bat. He is a handy bowler too (and has kept wickets in the past as well).  But he showed his importance on the field with an extraordinary catch to dismiss Pakistan’s most dangerous batter at the moment, Mohammad Rizwan. The Pakistan captain cut the ball hard, and much like Kohli, would have expected a four for that shot. This time, Phillips threw himself to his left at point, and completed another catch for the ages. Given it was to his wrong side, and the ball was quite high up in the air, this might just be the best one of the three spectacular catches that Phillips took in the tournament.

Eight years on since a three-ball duck in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan, India captain Rohit Sharma made amends by scoring his first half-century in an ICC tournament final during the 2025 Champions Trophy summit clash against New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday.
The 37-year-old Rohit waltzed to his half-century in only 41 balls as India motored past 50 within eight overs of a 253-run chase against New Zealand.
FOLLOW LIVE: IND vs NZ Champions Trophy Live Blog
Playing in his 9th ICC tournament final across formats and 18 years, Rohit went past the half-century mark for the first time, bettering a 31-ball 47 against Australia during the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia in Ahmedabad.
Rohit, who went past the 11,000-run mark in ODIs recently and smashed his 32nd ODI century against England last month, has had an iffy run in the tournament in the four previous outings. Despite his starts, Rohit fell for scores of 41, 20, 15 and 28 in the league stage and the semi-final against Australia.
Rohit’s first ICC final appearance came in his debut international season in 2007 during the T20 World Cup in South Africa. The Mumbaikar chipped in with a valuable unbeaten 30 against Pakistan in a match India won by 5 runs.

Title: India’s chokeslam: How Varun, Kuldeep, Axar and Jadeja strangled New Zealand’s scoring in Champions Trophy final

IND vs NZ Final Champions Trophy 2025: This was a chokeslam, like how Undertaker would grab the scruff of his opponents’ neck and slam them down. But India’s new spin quartet – Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Varun Chakaravarthy – did it in the most non-violent way possible on a hot afternoon in Dubai. That the four spinners, ever since they came together during the group fixture against New Zealand a week back, were going to weave their magic seemed like a given even before Sunday’s Champions Trophy final. By the end of the first innings – where NZ managed 25/17 – they had every bit lived up to that billing.
But to do so, they had to overcome the most challenging of tasks that confronted them on this trip. Except Steve Smith in the semi-finals, none of their opponents in the tournament have tried to go hard against India’s spin attack. So once their seamers – Mohammed Shami and Hardik Pandya – gave way to the spinners, they have effortlessly tightened the screws.
IND vs NZ Final LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
On Sunday, they didn’t have that luxury. This may be a used pitch – the first such instance in this tournament – but it was still dry, all hinting at more turn. When they played Pakistan on the same pitch, there was 2.8 degrees turn, but in the final there was just 2.0 degrees turn – the lowest in the Dubai leg of the Champions Trophy. India didn’t fret. They accepted the challenge and went about overcoming it by mixing up their pace, trajectory and using the variations to chokeslam the Kiwis.
As Will Young and, in particular, Rachin Ravindra wasted no time to hit top gear and put India under early pressure, Rohit Sharma had to bring on Varun as early as the sixth over with 37 runs already on board. Off his second over, Varun got rid of Young, but with 69 runs already scored by the end of the first powerplay – the most India have conceded here – New Zealand had the momentum. That India by then had already dropped two catches (there were a few more later) and were ordinary on the field didn’t help either. Even Varun had gone for 21 runs in his first three overs. For the first time, Rohit Sharma was forced into giving a spread-out field. Even the fielders inside the ring were sparsely populated, enabling easy singles through the gap.
So when Kuldeep and Axar came on to bowl in tandem, India needed them to not just stream the run-flow but get the wickets as well. They had already strangled Pakistan here once between overs 11-20, but this is a New Zealand side that plays them better than most other teams. The pressure was telling on India. Two of New Zealand’s best players of spin – Rachin and Kane – were in the middle.
Then off the first ball, Kuldeep played a bluff straight-up, getting one to straighten from the middle stump. Rachin had lined up to cut it, but once the ball straightened, he had no chance as it clipped his front pad and then the stumps. When Kuldeep gets a wicket straight-away he is a different bowler. So far in this tournament, he had blown hot and cold, often struggling for rhythm. But as soon as he got Rachin, Kuldeep was at home, bowling between 78-86 kmph. Those pace variations brought him Williamson’s wicket in his second over.

Through those two wickets, the spinners got down to choke New Zealand’s run-scoring. The huge gaps inside the ring began to narrow as Kuldeep went on the attack from one end, Axar holding the other end. The dot balls piled up and when Jadeja came on in the 20th over, there was no respite either as New Zealand would go 81 deliveries without scoring a boundary.
The four spinners bowled through the middle overs as Rohit rotated them to good effect. He attacked with Kuldeep and Varun from one end and used Axar and Jadeja to strangle from the other as New Zealand scored only 103 runs in the 30 overs, losing four wickets on a pitch that didn’t offer much help. Latham tried to sweep Jadeja and was trapped in front, Glenn Phillips played a cameo before Varun cut short his stay with a googly.
The dominance of the spinners continued in the final powerplay as well. Like he did against Pakistan, Kuldeep bowled three overs here (41, 43 & 47) and conceded just 13 runs. Varun bowled a couple too, giving away only 8 runs. In all the four spinners, bowled 38 overs between them (Axar not completing his quota), and conceded 144 runs while accounting for 5 wickets. The dot ball count of 125 again stood out which means out of the 38 overs, New Zealand didn’t score for nearly 21 of those.
Most of those came off the bat of Daryl Mitchell who consumed 51 dot balls in his innings of 63 that came off 103 deliveries. With wickets falling around him, he took the game deep, in the hope one from the lower order could give them the final flourish. After Phillips, Michael Bracewell took over, scoring an unbeaten 53 to take New Zealand to 251/7. At the halfway stage, India once again would be the happier side.

Title: Champions Trophy final: Why Kane Williamson won’t field in the IND vs NZ match in Dubai?

Content:
In a big blow for New Zealand, Kane Williamson, one of their best fielders could not take part in defending their 251-run target against India in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai due to an injury. New Zealand cricket informed about the development just before the second innings in the match commenced.
“Kane Williamson will not field in the second innings of the Champions Trophy final after picking up a quad strain while batting. Mark Chapman has taken his place in the field,” New Zealand Cricket stated. Williamson couldn’t contribute much with the bat in the match, scoring just 11 runs before he was caught and bowled by Kuldeep Yadav in the 13th over.
In the match, shepherded by a brilliant Yadav (2/40), Indian spinners aced the conditions but well-timed fifties by Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell steered New Zealand to a competitive 251 for seven.
Daryl Mitchell (63, 101 balls) and Bracewell (53 off 40 balls) navigated the Blackcaps through a turbulent middle phase after they opted to bat first.
However, the start made by New Zealand did not justify the total that they eventually managed.
They raced to 69 for 1 in 10 overs despite losing Will Young to Varun Chakravarthy (2/45), who came to bowl as early as the sixth over. The introduction of Kuldeep 11th over changed the complexion of the game.
With his first ball, Kuldeep consumed Rachin Ravindra, who failed to read a wonderfully concealed googly that disturbed his stumps.
It also ended a good 57-run opening stand, in which Ravindra, who punished Hardik Pandya for a six and two fours in row, was dropped on 28 by Mohammed Shami off his own bowling.

In the very next over, Williamson’s forward prod off the left-arm wrist spinner eventuated in a return catch as the Kiwis slipped to 75 for three in 12.2 overs.

Aamir Khan is celebrating his 60th birthday on Friday, and in a press meet held a day before his birthday, the actor opened up about his girlfriend Gauri Spratt. He requested photographers to not take pictures as the two shared an informal interaction with the media. Aamir shared that he first met Gauri 25 years ago, and reconnected with her through his cousin, Nuzhat Khan. The two started dating over a year ago.
“Bhuvan ko uski Gauri mil hi gayi (Bhuvan finally met his Gauri),” Aamir joked at the press meet, making a reference to his film Lagaan. The actor shared that Gauri isn’t a huge fan of Hindi films, and just recently watched three of his movies – Dil Chahta Hai, Lagaan and Dangal. Aamir added that he is keen for her to watch Taare Zameen Par as it was his directorial debut. Currently, Gauri is working with Aamir Khan Productions.
Gauri lives in Bengaluru and was married previously. She has a six-year-old son and is part-Irish, part-Tamil. Aamir and Gauri described themselves as “committed,” and Aamir laughed about successfully keeping their relationship a secret for over a year. “Dekha kuch bhi pata nahi chalne diya maine tum logo ko (See, I did not let you get a wind of this),” he said.

He shared during the press meet that his family members are very happy for them, and his children get along with Gauri, and are fond of her. He also revealed that Gauri has met his friends and contemporaries Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan as well. “I thought it would be a nice occasion for you all to meet her, besides we won’t have to keep hiding. She met Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan last night,” he said.
But, when asked about the question of getting married again, Aamir said he feels “settled” with Gauri. “I don’t know… at the age of 60, mujhe shaadi shobha deti hai ki nahi (if it appears alright to get married),” he shared.
Aamir has been married twice before. He first married Reena Dutta in 1986 and the two were married until 2002. They share two children – Ira and Junaid. He then married Kiran Rao in 2005; they split up in 2021. They share a son – Azad.  Talking about his ex-wives, Aamir said he feels “fortunate” to have great relationships with them, and added, “I’ve been fortunate to be in a strong relationship. Like, Reena and I spent 16 years together, and then Kiran and I spent 16 years together, and in many ways we are still together. I’ve learnt so much, and it’s been very enriching. With Gauri, I feel settled.”
Aamir is now looking forward to the release of Sitaare Zameen Par.

Title: The Electric State movie review: The Russo Brothers deliver the worst film of their career; even The Gray Man wasn’t this grim
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/the-electric-state-movie-review-the-russo-brothers-deliver-the-worst-film-of-their-careers-netflix-9884601/
Content:
Someone on social media the other day posted that each of the last 15 Best Picture winners at the Oscars could’ve been funded for the amount that Netflix spent on The Electric State, the astronomically expensive new movie from directors Joe and Anthony Russo. We’re talking about films like Oppenheimer, which itself would’ve taken up $100 million of this cash pool, leaving the remaining $220 million to be spent on landmark films such as Parasite, 12 Years a Slave, and this year’s Anora.
Starring Chris Pratt and Millie Bobby Brown, The Electric State is the kind of movie that seems to get longer while you’re watching it. No matter how deep into it you are — it could be the end of the first act or the second — it always feels like there’s an hour still left. On the face of it, The Electric State isn’t a particularly long movie. It taps out at around 120 minutes, which is positively merciful of the Russos, whose first gig after the global success of the three-hour-long Avengers: Endgame was Cherry, a 141-minute drama about a drug addict who robs banks to fund his habit.
Also read – Damsel movie review: A dismal drag of a fantasy film from Millie Bobby Brown and Netflix
Compared to The Electric State, Cherry seems like a work of startling originality. Heck, The Electric State falls short of even the low benchmark that the Russos set for themselves with their previous big-budget Netflix offering, the espionage thriller The Gray Man. Ayushmann Khurrana can complain all he wants about his career becoming collateral damage during the pandemic — as tastes changed, so did the audience’s interest in watching his films on the big screen — but it’s the Russos who’ve completely lost their mojo in the last five years.
Having developed a reputation for being spendthrifts — they’ve spent a grand total of nearly $1 billion on their last four projects, which also includes the disastrous Prime Video series Citadel — the Russos appear to be operating on autopilot. It’s content born out of a sense of contentment. Their post-pandemic projects have a certain algorithmic quality to them. The Russos’ primary objective isn’t to produce populist entertainment, but to build franchises. The Electric State has the same muddy aesthetic as each of their most recent projects — it’s a hodgepodge of hastily rendered CGI and half-baked lore.
The movie begins on a threatening note, with an elaborate (and clumsily executed) torrent of exposition. We flash back to an alternate mid-90s, where retro-futuristic robots programmed to do humanity’s bidding rose up in arms. A war ensued; the robots were eventually defeated and sent into exile in a cordoned-off corner of America. During the conflict, our heroine Michelle’s genius brother Christopher was kidnapped for having the special ability to mentally bond with machines (don’t ask). Some years later, Michelle is paid a visit by a Dobby-lite droid named Cosmo, who appears to have been possessed by the consciousness of Chris. Michelle resolves to go on an epic cross-country mission into the exclusion zone to reunite with her long-lost brother.
Along the way, she joins hands with a military veteran named Keats, played by Pratt. It’s yet another approximation of the Han Solo archetype that Pratt previously played in the Jurassic World films, as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. Keats was a soldier during the war, but now works as some kind of smuggler along with his own robot companion, Herm, voiced by Anthony Mackie. You’d think that it would be beneath Captain America himself to voice a non-human comedy relief character in a film this poor, but that’s exactly what he does here. Spare a thought, however, for poor Colman Domingo, who ‘appears’ in a one-scene cameo as a security bot of some kind. He’s a two-time Academy Award nominee!

But that’s the thing with the Russos these days; they bring everyone around them, including the audience, to their level. Alan Silvestri, who produced such memorable music for Avengers: Endgame, appears to have rehashed some of his themes from that film. And there’s no way of proving this, but certain shots in the Electric State’s action-packed climax seem to have been created by re-skinning similar shots from Endgame’s climactic battle. If Michael Bay can do this, there’s no way that the Russos can’t.
In The Electric State, they aim for a Spielbergian sense of wonder, but accomplish only one feat: eroding the magic of the movies, one frame at a time. There are, of course, attempts at humour. But because they’re made either by robots or human beings with a robotic personality, they fall flat. This is a disappointingly lifeless film, which is ironic, because one of its many unoriginal ideas is to question whether sentient robots have feelings. The Electric State also makes tired observations about post-9/11 paranoia, class inequality, and artificial intelligence. But while there’s plenty of artifice on display, you’ll have a hard time spotting any intelligence.

Title: SpiceJet cabin crew’s Holi dance on flight goes viral; netizens call it ‘unprofessional’

Holi celebrations in India are never complete without some viral moments, and 2025 is no different. This time, a video of SpiceJet cabin crew members dancing to the popular Bollywood song Balam Pichkari from Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani has taken over social media. The clip captures air hostesses and flight stewards enthusiastically grooving to the beats, bringing a splash of festive energy inside the aircraft. Passengers were seen recording the performance, enjoying the unexpected in-flight entertainment.
The video was shared on Instagram by a user named Govind Roy (@govindroyicai), who captioned it, “SpiceJet entertaining their customers like this on the occasion of Holi.”


A post shared by Govind Roy (@govindroyicai)

While the video racked up over 3 lakh views, it sparked a debate online. Many social media users were not thrilled with the idea. Some criticised the move as unprofessional, while others linked it to delays and service issues. One person commented, “Many years ago, I traveled on SpiceJet, and that day I decided it would be my last time with them. I am so glad I took that decision, and I still do not travel with this airline.”
Another added, “No wonder the flight is delayed 5 hours.” A third questioned the airline’s priorities, saying, “Why are you forcing people to do a job out of their job description? Let them do better on what they signed up for.”
A few cabin crew professionals also weighed in, with one remarking, “As a cabin crew member, I don’t appreciate it. It’s not at all professional.”
However, SpiceJet stood by the tradition, sharing its own video highlighting that this Holi celebration by the crew has been a part of their festive spirit since 2014.

The festivities started the moment passengers boarded, as crew members welcomed them with a traditional chandan teeka before putting on their lively in-flight performance.

If you’ve got a smartphone, you probably spend too much time on it — checking Instagram, watching silly TikTok videos, messaging on WhatsApp or doomscrolling on X.
It can be hard to curb excessive use of smartphones and social media, which are addictive by design. Reducing your screen time is often more than just a matter of willpower, especially for younger people whose brains and impulse control are still developing.
If you’re a phone addict who wants to cut down on the hours a day spent looking at your device, here are some techniques you can try to free up more IRL time:
An easy first step is getting rid of any apps you’ve been wasting time on.
Over the past year, I’ve deleted Facebook, Instagram and Twitter from my phone because I wanted to use them less. Now and then I’ll have to go the app store and reinstall one because I need to do something like post a photo I took on my phone. (Sometimes I’ll transfer the photo to my laptop and then post it to the web from there, but usually, it’s too much hassle.)
The danger with this approach is that if you do reinstall the app, you won’t bother deleting it again.
Both iPhones and Android devices have onboard controls to help regulate screen time. They can also be used by parents to regulate children’s phone usage.
Apple’s Screen Time controls are found in the iPhone’s settings menu. Users can set overall Downtime, which shuts off all phone activity during a set period. If you want a phone-free evening, then you could set it to kick in from, say, 7 p.m. until 7 a.m.
The controls also let users put a blanket restriction on certain categories of apps, such as social, games or entertainment or zero in on a specific app, by limiting the time that can be spent on it. Too distracted by Instagram? Then set it so that you can only use it for a daily total of 20 minutes.
The downside is that the limits aren’t hard to get around. It’s more of a nudge than a red line that you can’t cross. If you try to open an app with a limit, you’ll get a screen menu offering one more minute, a reminder after 15 minutes, or to completely ignore it.
Android users can use turn to their Digital Wellbeing settings, which include widgets to remind users how much screen time they’ve had. There’s also the option to create separate work and personal profiles, so you can hide your social media apps and their notifications when you’re at the office.
There are other little tricks to make your phone less distracting. I use the Focus mode on my iPhone to silence notifications. For example, If I’m in a meeting somewhere, I mute it until I leave that location. Android also has a Focus mode to pause distracting apps.
Change your phone display to grayscale from color so that it doesn’t look so exciting. On iPhones, adjust the color filter in your settings. For Android, turn on Bedtime Mode, or tweak the color correction setting.
Android phones can also nag users not to look at their phones while walking, by activating the Heads Up feature in Digital Wellbeing.
If the built-in controls aren’t enough, there are many third-party apps, like Jomo, Opal, Forest, Roots and LockMeOut that are designed to cut down screen time.
Many of these apps have both free and premium versions with more features, and strongly push you toward signing up for a subscription by minimizing the option to “skip for now” on the payment screen. I tested out a few on my iPhone for this story.
To try out Opal, I reinstalled Facebook so I could block it. Whenever I tapped the Facebook icon, Opal intervened to give me various inspirational messages, like “Gain Wisdom, Lose Facebook,” and tallied how many times I tried to open it. To get around the block, I had to open Opal and wait through a six-second timeout before requesting up to 15 minutes to look at Facebook. There’s an option to up the difficulty by increasing the delay before you can look again.
Jomo, which I used to restrict my phone’s Reddit app, worked in a similar way: tap the Unlock button, which took me to the Jomo app, where I had to wait 20 seconds before I could tap the button to unlock Reddit for up to 10 minutes.
The OneSec app takes a different approach by reminding users to first take a pause. The installation, which involves setting up an automation on the iPhone’s Shortcuts, can be confusing. When I eventually installed it for my Bluesky app, it gave me a prompt to run a shortcut that wiped my screen with a soothing purple-blue and reminded me to take a deep breath before letting me choose to open the app — but in practice it was too easy to just skip the prompt.
The Android-only LockMeOut can freeze you out of designated apps based on criteria like your location, how many times you’ve opened an app, or how long you’ve used it.
The obvious way to defeat these apps is simply to delete them, although some advise users to follow the proper uninstall procedure or else apps could remain blocked.
Digital blockers might not be for everyone. Some startups, figuring that people might prefer a tangible barrier, offer hardware solutions that introduce physical friction between you and an app.
Unpluq is a yellow tag that you have to hold up to your phone in order to access blocked apps. Brick and Blok are two different products that work along the same lines — they’re squarish pieces of plastic that you have to tap or scan with your phone to unlock an app.
The makers of these devices say that software solutions are too easy to bypass, but a physical object that you can put somewhere out of reach or leave behind if you’re going somewhere is a more effective way to get rid of distractions.
What about stashing the phone away entirely? There are various phone lockboxes and cases available, some of them designed so parents can lock up their teenagers’ phones when they’re supposed to be sleeping. Yondr, which makes portable phone locking pouches used at concerts or in schools, also sells a home phone box.
Perhaps there are deeper reasons for your smartphone compulsion. Maybe it’s a symptom of underlying problems like anxiety, stress, loneliness, depression or low self-esteem. If you think that’s the case, it could be worth exploring therapy that is becoming more widely available.
One London hospital treats “technology addiction” with a plan that includes dealing with “discomfort in face-to-face time” with other people, and exploring your relationship with technology.
Another clinic boasts that its social media addiction treatment also includes working on a patient’s technology management skills, such as “setting boundaries for device usage, finding alternative activities to fill the void of reduced online interaction, and learning how to engage more with the physical world.”
Why not trade your smartphone for a more basic one? It’s an extreme option but there’s a thriving subculture of cellphones with only basic features, catering to both retro enthusiasts and people, including parents, worried about screen time. They range from cheap old-school brick-and-flip phones by faded brands like Nokia to stylish but pricier devices from boutique manufacturers like Punkt.
The tradeoff, of course, is that you’ll also have to do without essential apps like Google Maps or your bank.

Title: ‘Disturbing rise of anti-Muslim bigotry’: UN chief urges govts to protect religious freedom
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/world/un-chief-anti-muslim-bigotry-combat-islamophobia-day-9886973/
Content:
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres Saturday expressed concerns over increasing anti-Muslim sentiment worldwide, urging governments and online platforms to take action against xenophobia, discrimination and hate speech.
“We are witnessing a disturbing rise in anti-Muslim bigotry. From racial profiling and discriminatory policies that violate human rights and dignity, to outright violence against individuals and places of worship,” Guterres said in a video message marking International Day to Combat Islamophobia on Saturday.
Guterres did not mention any specific countries, but called on governments to foster social cohesion and protect religious freedom, and for online platforms to curb hate speech and harassment.
“When one group is attacked, the rights and freedoms of all are at risk. As a global community, we must reject and eradicate bigotry,” he added.
The UN chief also called on digital platforms to tackle online hate speech, stating, “Online platforms must curb hate speech and harassment. And we must all speak out against bigotry, xenophobia and discrimination.”
In 2022, the UN General Assembly agreed for March 15 to be marked as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia in the wake of the 2019 mass shootings in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand that had killed over 50 people.
The 193-member General Assembly adopted the resolution ‘Measures to combat Islamophobia’, introduced by Pakistan and co-sponsored by China. A total of 115 nations voted in favour, none against and 44 countried abstained including India, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Ukraine and the UK.
“On this International Day to Combat Islamophobia, let us work together to uphold equality, human rights, and dignity, and build inclusive societies where everyone, regardless of their faith, can live in peace and harmony,” Guterres said.

Title: Ted Lasso Season 4 is coming: Jason Sudeikis hints at AFC Richmond’s next big move; details inside
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/ted-lasso-season-4-is-coming-jason-sudeikis-hints-at-afc-richmonds-next-big-move-details-inside-9887047/

Ted Lasso Season 4 update: If you’ve been missing Jason Sudeikis’ iconic moustache and Coach Lasso’s energy, here’s some great news. The Emmy-winning comedy series is officially coming back for a fourth season. Apple TV+ made the big announcement on Friday, and Sudeikis even dropped a hint about where the story is heading next.
Before season 3 aired, Sudeikis had made it clear they always planned Ted Lasso as a three-season arc. “This is the end of this story we wanted to tell,” he told Deadline back in 2023. But never say never. Sudeikis admitted it has been flattering to see how much fans wanted more. And now, they are getting it. As for what’s next, Sudeikis teased in a press release (via PEOPLE), “In season four, the folks at AFC Richmond learn to ‘leap before they look,’ discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.”
Also read: How the world fell under the spell of Ted Lasso
“Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut,” said Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+. “We’re thrilled to keep working with Jason and the amazing creative team behind this show.” So far, there is no official cast lineup confirmed apart from Sudeikis reprising his role as Coach Lasso. But according to The Hollywood Reporter, Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins) have all been approached.
Jack Burditt, best known for Nobody Wants This, Modern Family, and 30 Rock, has been brought on board as the executive producer for the upcoming installment. Jason Sudeikis will not only reprise his role but also return as an executive producer.
Earlier, while speaking on Travis Kelce and his brother Jason’s New Heights podcast, Sudeikis revealed that in the upcoming season, he’ll be coaching a women’s team. “We’re writing Season 4 now, that’s the official word,” Sudeikis said. “Ted’s coaching a women’s team.”
At the Banff World Media Festival in June 2024, Warner Bros. TV boss Channing Dungey shared that they are not rushing into anything, whether a spinoff or a next season, when it comes to Ted Lasso. “It’s not about making more just for the sake of it,” she said. “It’s about having a story we actually want to tell.” Bill Lawrence, the show’s co-creator, shared with Collider in August 2024 that the cast and crew genuinely loved making the show and are excited about continuing, but any decision hinges on Sudeikis. “Not only is he the star, he’s the head writer. His life has to be totally moved around if we do more—especially with young kids,” Lawrence explained.
The season tied up a lot of loose ends but also left a few doors open for more stories. Ted returned to the US to spend more time with his son, Henry, which meant an emotional farewell with his players. We saw Roy Kent (played by Brett Goldstein) stepping in as the club’s new manager, ready to lead AFC Richmond into its next chapter. Meanwhile, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) thought about selling the team but ultimately held on to it, realising how much it means to her and the community. Keeley (Juno Temple) focused on building her own PR firm, and there was even a hint about her starting a women’s team. The love triangle between Keeley, Roy, and Jamie (Phil Dunster)? Still up in the air.
Developed by Sudeikis, Brendan Hunt, Bill Lawrence, and Joe Kelly, Ted Lasso is based on a preexisting NBC Sports format. Since its debut, the show has racked up an impressive 61 Emmy nominations and has taken home 14 wins so far.

Title: Indian Wells: Teen sensation Andreeva blows away defending champion Swiatek to set up final clash vs Sabalenka
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/indian-wells-mirra-andreeva-beat-iga-swiatek-final-vs-sabalenka-result-news-9887050/
Content:
Russian teen sensation Mirra Andreeva blew away defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6(1), 1-6, 6-3 to reach the Indian Wells final on Saturday where she will meet top seed Aryna Sabalenka, who avenged her Australian Open final loss to Madison Keys with a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing.
“Really tough match, tough conditions,” said the 17-year-old who is gunning for her second straight WTA 1000 title following her win in Dubai last month.
“I tried to really hang in there. It was not easy, but I’m super happy with the win today and I can’t wait to play finals on Sunday,” added Andreeva.
After a tight first set, Andreeva was flawless in the tiebreak, leaning over and letting out a roar when she enticed a forehand error from Swiatek on set point.
The Polish second seed stormed back in the second set, breaking in the first game and levelling the contest when Andreeva’s backhand went wide.
Andreeva, who was studying handwritten notes during the changeovers, grabbed the momentum back by breaking to open the third set as temperatures in the California desert plummeted and the wind picked up.
The loss ends five-time major champion Swiatek’s bid to become the first woman to win the tournament in the Southern California desert three times.
In the other semi-final, a ruthless Sabalenka needed just 52 minutes to get payback for her loss to Keys in the Melbourne Park final in January.
A Keys double fault handed Sabalenka a 4-0 lead in the opener and the Belarusian rolled through the set with ease despite windy conditions.
The crowd erupted when Keys won her first game of the match to cut Sabalenka’s lead to 5-1 in the second but that would be it for the American, who hit a backhand into the net on match point.
“I didn’t expect that match to be that fast but I’m super happy,” Sabalenka said. “Much needed revenge.”
Three-time Grand Slam champion Sabalenka, who reached the Indian Wells final in 2023, said she was looking forward to playing the teenager.
“It feels like old mama playing against the kid,” said 26-year-old Sabalenka. “I’m like what, nine years older than her? She is two years younger than my sister and I look at my sister as a kid. It’s crazy.”
In the men’s semi-final, Danish Holger Rune will face Russia’s Daniil Medvedev while Spanish superstar Carlos Alcaraz will be up against English Jack Draper on Sunday (March). The women’s final will be played on the same day.

Title: Republican legislation seeks to ban Chinese nationals from studying in US
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/news-today/republican-legislation-ban-chinese-nationals-studying-us-9887029/
Content:
A group of House Republicans on Friday put forward legislation seeking to prevent Chinese students from studying in American schools, as some US lawmakers are targeting China over national security concerns.
Rep. Riley Moore, R-W.Va., introduced the bill that could bar Chinese nationals from receiving visas that allow foreigners to travel to the US to study or participate in exchange visitor programmes. Five other Republicans co-sponsored the measure.
By granting Chinese nationals such visas, the US has “invited” the Chinese Communist Party “to spy on our military, steal our intellectual property, and threaten national security”, Moore said in a statement. “It’s time we turn off the spigot and immediately ban all student visas going to Chinese nationals.” The measure is unlikely to pass, and it has drawn criticism from organisations and scholars over concerns that hostile policies and rhetoric toward Chinese students could hurt US interests.
“No policy should target individuals solely on the basis of their national origin,” Fanta Aw, executive director and CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators, said in a statement.
“Making international students — the most vetted and tracked nonimmigrants in the United States — a scapegoat for xenophobic and anti-Chinese sentiment is misguided and antithetical to our national interest,” Aw said.
Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China “expresses strong concern and firmly opposes such practices”. He said education exchange and cooperation has long served as a pillar for the stable development of China-US relations.
The Asian American Scholars Forum said such legislation would harm the talent pipeline of Asian American scientists, scholars and researchers, undermining US leadership in science and innovation.
Despite the bill’s slim chance of getting approved, Yangyang Cheng, research scholar at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Centre, said the bill “should be seen as part of a broader effort to restrict academic freedom and hurt higher education in this country, to control what can be taught, which research projects can be pursued, and who have access to the classrooms and laboratories”.
In the 2023-24 school year, more than 2.77 lakh Chinese students were studying in US universities, or a quarter of the total number of international students, according to an annual report on international students from the Institute of International Education. The number of Chinese students in the US, however, has been declining for years. Last year, China lost its status to India as the top feeder country of international students.
In 2023, Florida passed a law prohibiting state universities from hiring students from China and six other countries for graduate assistant and postdoc positions and it has been challenged in court. Several US universities have ended academic partnerships with Chinese schools amid mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers over national security concerns.
Reactions on China’s social media to the new legislation were varied. Some who said they had recently received offers from American schools expressed concerns, some dismissed it as “a political show” and some called it “another Chinese Exclusion Act”.

Title: Vadodara accident case: Law student who killed woman, left 7 injured sent to police custody

Content:
A Vadodara court on Saturday granted police custody of Rakshit Chaurasiya, a law student accused of killing one person and injuring seven others in a car accident on Thursday night. The court sent Chaurasiya to one day in custody following a late-night hearing on Friday, according to the city’s police commissioner, Narsimha Komar.
In their request for the remand, the Vadodara police told the court that further investigation was required to establish the events leading up to the crash and to determine whether Chaurasiya was intentionally driving under the influence of intoxicants. The police are also investigating the relationship between Chaurasiya and Praanshu Chauhan, the son of the vehicle’s owner, who was in the car during the incident.
The court was informed that an inquiry was necessary to understand why Chaurasiya, rather than Chauhan, was driving the car at the time of the accident. The police are also looking into Chaurasiya’s past and his associations with others present before the crash.
On Friday, police arrested Chauhan and identified a third individual, Suresh, who was reportedly with Chaurasiya and Chauhan in the hours leading up to the accident but was not in the vehicle when it occurred. Blood samples from all three have been sent for forensic examination to determine whether they had consumed any intoxicants together.
The police aim to clarify the details of the incident and any potential connections between the individuals involved as part of their ongoing investigation.

Title: The Diplomat box office collection day 1: John Abraham’s political thriller delivers Rs 4 crore debut, falls short of Madras Cafe 12 years ago
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/the-diplomat-box-office-collection-day-1-john-abraham-political-thriller-delivers-rs-4-crore-debut-9887043/
Content:
Actor John Abraham’s new film, The Diplomat, opened in theatres on the Holi holiday. The movie delivered a solid start, earning Rs 4 crore, according to industry tracker Sacnilk. This is par for the course for John, falling in the same range as his last release, Vedaa, as well as Satyameva Jayate 2 and the pre-pandemic release Pagalpanti. Directed by Shivam Nair, Vedaa features John playing against type, marking a major deviation from his usual action-heavy roles. The actor has acknowledged that his fans might have certain expectations from him, but he has also been praised for pushing his boundaries with intelligent choices.
Vedaa’s Rs 4 crore debut is higher than the Rs 3.2 crore made by Satyameva Jayate 2, the Rs 3.8 crore opening of Attack – Part 1, and the Rs 2.8 crore opening of Mumbai Saga. But it is lower than the Rs 6 crore debut of Vedaa and the Rs 7 crore opening of Ek Villain Returns. Despite bigger debuts, both those films were seen as under-performers at the box office. Between them, John also played the primary antagonist in the Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Pathaan, which made Rs 57 crore on day one.
Also read – Anurag Kashyap on The Diplomat: ‘After a long time, I am seeing John Abraham being a very a good actor’
His last major solo release was Satyameva Jayate, which made Rs 19 crore on opening day in 2018. Among John’s more grounded efforts, Romeo Akbar Walter made Rs 5.3 crore on day one, Batla House made Rs 14 crore, Parmanu – The Story of Pokhran made Rs 4.8 crore and Madras Cafe made Rs 5.2 crore. The Diplomat’s opening should’ve been higher, considering that 12 years have passed since Madras Cafe’s release.
The movie saw a total occupancy of 20% on day one, with evening shows and night shows contributing to 28% and 26% occupancy, respectively. Since it was Holi on Friday, family audiences were likely busy during the first half of the day, which suggests that the movie might witness an uptick in collections on Saturday and Sunday. The Diplomat earned mixed-to-positive response, which should help it in the first week of release. It is challenging the Vicky Kaushal-starrer Chhaava, and will have to maximise its potential until Salman Khan’s Sikandar rolls around by Eid.

Title: ‘I send Raha emails’: Alia Bhatt on creating a digital memory book for her daughter; how documenting childhood moments shapes emotional bonds

Alia Bhatt is balancing her career while being a devoted mother to her two-year-old daughter, Raha.
In a recent episode of On Purpose with Jay Shetty, Alia revealed that she has been creating a digital memory book for her daughter Raha, a practice that she hopes will be a cherished gift in the future. She said, “I have been doing this thing where I send Raha emails. I’ve been doing it since she was born, every month. And, just like an amalgamation of photos, videos, and moments, just telling her what happened, thoughts, and feelings.” She further added, “It’s like a life memory book. When maybe she’s 15, I’ll give this to her and say, ‘Listen, these are all the memories we collected for you over the years.’”
Capturing childhood moments through letters, journals, or emails is a unique way of preserving memories and emotions that might otherwise fade over time.
Psychologist Anjali Gursahaney tells indianexpress.com, “When a child receives a collection of personal letters or emails documenting their early years, it helps shape their identity, emotional well-being, and relationships. Knowing their story, origins, and family experiences fosters a strong sense of self and connection to their roots. These written memories also provide emotional security, reinforcing feelings of love and self-worth.”
Since young children may not recall early experiences, she adds that reading about them later aids in memory consolidation, helping them reconstruct their personal history. Additionally, even if they don’t read the messages until years later, simply knowing their parents took the time to reflect on their journey strengthens the parent-child bond, building trust and a lasting connection.


A post shared by alia bhatt fanpage (@stanaliaa)
For both parents and children, Gursahaney notes that this practice offers profound emotional and relational benefits. Writing provides emotional catharsis for parents, helping them process their feelings, track personal growth, and reflect on their parenting journey. It also strengthens attachment bonds by keeping parents deeply engaged in their child’s life beyond daily routines, fostering a lasting emotional connection. “Revisiting happy moments through these letters enhances gratitude and mindfulness, amplifying positive emotions for both the parent and, eventually, the child. Moreover, these letters can become cherished keepsakes, creating a meaningful legacy that connects generations and preserves family history,” she explains.
To make this process sustainable, Gursahaney says that parents can:

Title: Champions Trophy final: Despite fielding disaster class, India strangle NZ who are restricted for 251/7

Champions Trophy final: Usually a decent fielding side, India has been uncharacteristically poor in the field during the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy 2025.
In the final against New Zealand, Indian fielders dropped four catches and missed couple of run outs. Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer, Shubman Gill, Mohammed Shami, and Kuldeep Yadav were the fielders responsible for missed chances.
India vs New Zealand CT Final LIVE Cricket Score, Streaming Online: Watch Here
Shubman Gill is considered a safe fielder in the deep region but the Indian vice captain let go off a simple chance in the 36th over. Glenn Phillips pulled a flat delivery from Ravindra Jadeja and despite getting in a comfortable position early on, Gill failed to hold on to the catch. The ball was dropping and dipping on him and Gill could only get his fingers to the ball.
There was a viral video of Kuldeep Yadav getting an earful from both Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma after he didn’t grab a throw on the bowler’s end against Australia. Something similar happened in the 41st over when Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell got in each other’s way while running a single. Jadeja tried a direct hit from backward point but it wasn’t on target. Had Kuldeep been near the stumps, it was an easy run-out chance. Both Kohli and Jadeja didn’t seem happy with him.
Shreyas is a gun fielder and turned the game against Australia when he ran out Alex Carey with a direct-hit. However, he didn’t look at his best today and dropped the dangerous Rachin Ravindra at mid-wicket. In the 8th over, Rachin decided to take on Varun only to top edge the ball. Shreyas ran and covered a distance of 21m but failed to hold on to the catch as the ball popped out after hitting his hand.
Indian pacer Mohammed Shami has dropped as many as three follow-up caught and bowled chances in the tournament. In the semi-final against Australia, he dropped both Travis Head and Steve Smith off his own bowling. Similarly in the final, he dropped Rachin in the 7th over. The batter chipped back to the bowler and what looked like a fairly easy chance was dropped by Shami.
Indian skipper Rohit Sharma also got a chance in the 35th over when Mitchell pulled one and Rohit leapt only to throw it further in the air. It was a tough chance but added to another catch drop during the match.
Despite the fielding mishaps, Indian spinners did a brilliant job in keeping the Kiwi batters at bay as New Zealand finished with 251/7 in the 50 overs. Bracewell (53*) and Mitchell (63) scored 50s while Kuldeep and Varun took two wickets each for India.

Title: ‘It was not turning much’: Varun Chakravarthy opens up about Champions Trophy final pitch

India’s mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy also played an important role in keeping New Zealand in check in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai when he snapped up 2 wickets for 45 runs in his allotted 10 overs. With the pitch not offering much assistance, Chakravarthy still managed to snap up Will Young and Glenn Phillips.
“It was a good wicket compared to the last wicket. It was not turning much. All I could do was stick it into the stump line and wait for the batter to make some mistake. I like bowling in the death and the powerplay, it is more challenging and gives me more opportunity to pick wickets,” Varun said in he post-innings chat.
He also talked about his bond with his teammates and his injury during fielding, adding that the score put up by the Kiwis was gettable.
“I like talking to Kuldeep, even Jaddu bhai and Axar, I am pretty new to this set up and am looking to build some nice bonds. It (the right foot) is a little sore. It is a gettable score if we bat well initially,” he added.
In the match, India were set a target of 252 by New Zealand to win the Champions Trophy on Sunday.
Opting to bat, New Zealand were restricted to 251 for 7 with the Indian bowlers, especially the spinners, producing a clinical performance in the summit clash.
Daryl Mitchell top-scored for New Zealand with 63 from 101 balls, while Michael Bracewell, Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Phillips contributed 53 not out, 37 and 34 respectively.

For India, Kuldeep Yadav and Chakravarthy took two wickets apiece while Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami got one each.

Title: IND vs NZ final: Mohammed Shami records second-most expensive figures by an Indian in Champions Trophy history

Seamer Mohammed Shami had a forgettable outing in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday as he recorded the second-most expensive bowling figures by an Indian bowler in the history of the tournament.
FOLLOW LIVE: IND vs NZ Champions Trophy Live Blog
Bowling only nine overs for a solitary wicket, Shami leaked 74 runs with an economy of 8.22 runs per over as New Zealand posted a competitive 252 runs on board after Mitchell Santner won the toss and opted to bat first.
Shami’s figures follow Umesh Yadav’s analysis of 1/75 in 10 overs against South Africa from the 2013 Champions Trophy that India went onto win. Former off-spinners Harbhajan Singh and R Ashwin are the only other Indian to concede over 70 runs in a Champions Trophy match among Indian bowlers.
Overall, Pakistan pacer Wahab Riaz bears the unwanted record of conceding most runs in a match, having leaked 87 runs in 8.4 runs against India in 2017. Shami’s figures are not the worst of the ongoing campaign, with as many five bowlers conceding more runs in a game. Pakistan’s Haris Rauf had a rough outing against New Zealand in Karachi during the tournament opener, conceding 83 runs in 10 overs.
Despite making his debut over a decade ago, the ongoing tournament was Shami’s first Champions Trophy appearance and a first ICC event since a spell-binding ODI World Cup in 2023 where he rewrote numerous records, including a seven-wicket haul against the Kiwis in the semi-final.
Shami opened the tournament with a five-for against Bangladesh and also led the bowling charts with three wickets in the semi-final against Australia. Shami’s tournament ended as India’s joint-highest wicket-taker with nine scalps in five outings.
Most expensive figures by Indians in Champions Trophy history
1/75 – Umesh Yadav v South Africa, 2013
1/74 – Mohammed Shami v New Zealand, 2025

Title: Champions Trophy: Why Kuldeep Yadav, a dream bowler, a dazed fielder, amazes and aggravates team-mates in equal measure

There are a couple of players slower than him on the field, there are players who drop more catches than him, but it’s Kuldeep Yadav who is the target of the most fierce gestures from the captain Rohit Sharma or the senior Virat Kohli. Not without a reason, as Kuldeep can inexplicably slip into a state of laxity – be it not collecting a throw (which prompted both Rohit and Kohli to have a go at him during the game against Australia and Kohli and Jadeja to have a spray in the final against New Zealand), or bowling flatter, and not looking for wickets. “Aisa daalega toh, main bowling nahi doonga,” Rohit had once yelled from the slips in a Test.
What makes Kuldeep Yadav the target for such ire? Because Rohit knows the value of Kuldeep the strike-bowler and the player when not wandering in the garden.
Last May, months after he made his comeback from a knee injury that had threatened to derail him, Kuldeep would talk about his relationship with the captain: “Rohit bhai has always supported me. When I was injured, he was continuously in touch with me, and specifically told me about what he wanted from me. After the injury, he picked me directly in the team. Now he is after me to improve my batting.”
Rohit was ‘after him’ at the end of the Powerplay on Sunday at Dubai.

Kuldeep was just walking away from mid-off when Rohit called out to him and gestured that he was to bowl now. Kuldeep nodded and by the time he reached the stumps to hand the cap to the umpire, Kohli was with him, patting his back and throwing in a word.
The game was supremely balanced, it could perhaps be even said that New Zealand had the advantage at that point as they were cruising at 69 for 2 in 10 overs. They had even begun to attack India’s trump card Varun Chakaravarthy.
Kuldeep ripped a googly first ball at nearly 85 kmph that hurried on to the left-handed Rachin. Either its direction or the pace seemed to surprise Rachin who couldn’t get his bat in time, and was hit on the pad-flap before it castled the stumps – lbw and bowled in one ball. Kohli leapt at his position with a raised fist, and stood yelling in joy as Rachin walked past him; and was soon at the huddle, messing Kuldeep’s wild hair even as he let loose an celebratory expletive.
New Zealand still had Kane, fresh from a superb hundred where he had outwitted their best spinner Keshav Maharaj, by alternating between moving outside leg and outside off to throw the left-armer off his rhythm. In Kuldeep’s first over, Kane had shown no signs of trouble, wristing the legspinner down to long-on.
In Kuldeep’s second, the 13th of the innings, he leaned forward for a repeat of that single to long-on. But on a bone-dry pitch, Kuldeep had slowed up this one (slower than 82 kmph) and also released it from the front of the stumps on the bowling end. So, from almost a direct straight line and a lot slower. Kane stretched forward but the ball wasn’t quite there and it also perhaps slowed up a touch on landing, beating his wrist-snap. And the ball lobbed back to Kuldeep, who swallowed it.
Ironically, it was that injury to the knee that had threatened his career that also brought him back to his best. He was out of the team, a touch rudderless, seeking tips from one former bowler to another, when he was told in no uncertain terms by the NCA physical trainer Ashish Kaushik that he has to first sort out his action. That he cannot put weight on his right knee as it’s not going to take it.
During this tournament, broadcasters have been showing his jump prior to the release – it seems to have increased marginally from before, the front leg too bends more than before as a result, taking the load better.
Kuldeep missed the opportunity of run out..

Kuldeep’s childhood coach Kapil Pandey had explained the work done on Kuldeep in that phase. “After having a closer look at his medical report, I understood what Ashish ji meant. He wanted to protect his knee. We made a few adjustments in his run-up, I asked him to be aggressive. The results were not sudden. I made him bowl three hours in the morning and then a couple of hours in the evening at the nets but he needed match practice,” said Pandey.
He asked Kuldeep to play in a local T20 tournament in Kanpur. “Sir wanted me to get a taste of a match,” Kuldeep told this newspaper. “It was frustrating to start with. I was not getting my length right, I was losing the trajectory. I did work a lot and my leg would swell up but I would say, ‘Sir, don’t worry, I will apply ice’. He was with me through that journey. With the new run-up, I increased my pace but was bowling flat. After a couple of matches, I realised that batsmen were not getting more time with this new action and run-up. That was the first ray of hope I saw after a long time.”

Despite the presence of Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, Rohit Sharma still has a lot of belief in Kuldeep. And he has rewarded the trust with 7 wickets thus far. But one thing is certain; the moment he slips up on the field with his lack of awareness or laxity, both Kohli and Rohit would be after him – and that perhaps is a good thing for him as he immediately revs up his intensity.

Mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy leads the table for India with nine wickets in only three appearances in the tournament. Mohammed Shami followed the Tamil Nadu spinner with his ninth scalp in his fifth match. Chakaravarthy and Henry had picked up identical figures of 5/42 each during India and New Zealand’s league-stage clash at the same venue last Sunday. Meanwhile, Shami opened his Champions Trophy campaign with a five-wicket haul against Bangladesh and backed it up with impressive performances against the Kiwis and Australia in the semi-final.
Overall, Pakistan’s Hasan Ali (2017) and West Indies’ Jerome Taylor (2006) hold the record for most wickets in a Champions Trophy edition, with 13 scalps in their respective seasons.

IND vs NZ Final Champions Trophy 2025: Rohit Sharma, with his 12th straight toss loss, equalled former West Indies captain Brian Lara for losing the toss the most consecutive matches in men’s One Day Internationals. Rohit equalled the unwanted record as Mitchell Santner called it right and said New Zealand will bat first in the ICC Champions Trophy final. As the call fell in favour of Santner, Rohit had a wry smile on his face as he stepped aside for the NZ captain’s chat with Ravi Shastri.
The last time India won a toss in men’s ODIs was in the semifinal of the 2023 World Cup against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The toss-loss streak of 15 for India is already the longest in this format for countries, with the second worst streak among teams belonging to the Netherlands at 11.

“We’ve been here enough, batted first and bowled first, don’t really mind batting second,” Rohit said at the toss. “It hasn’t changed much, we’ve chased and won as well. It does give you a lot of confidence, takes the toss away from the game. At the end of the day, what matters is how well you want to play. That’s what we’ve spoken about in the dressing room, not to worry about the toss and to just play well, that’s what we’ve done and we have to do today as well.”
New Zealand were dealt a blow ahead of the final as Matt Henry didn’t come through a fitness test for his shoulder injury that he picked up while taking a catch during the semifinal against South Africa in Lahore. Nathan Smith came in as his replacement.

Title: ‘Whether it’s Ronaldo, Messi or Djokovic…’: What Ravi Shastri said about Virat Kohli ahead of Champions Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/whether-its-ronaldo-messi-or-djokovic-what-ravi-shastri-said-about-virat-kohli-ahead-of-champions-trophy-final-9877032/
Content:
Former India coach Ravi Shastri hailed Virat Kohli’s energy ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy final against New Zealand, saying that the Indian batsman had the kind of energy that was comparable to some of the top sportspeople in the world.
Kohli has 217 runs in this ICC Champions Trophy but Shastri said that it was also his energy on the ground while fielding and his demeanour that was very sport friendly.
“You know people (like to) watch sport when they watch a sportsman with energy,” Shastri said to the ICC Review. “Whether his name is (Cristiano) Ronaldo or it’s (Lionel) Messi or whether it’s a (Novak) Djokovic or whether it’s (Rafael) Nadal, that energy that they bring in – there’s a certain kind of charisma and it rubs off on other people. They want to watch this guy play.”
Shastri also spoke about what set Kohli apart in ODIs and how a return to what made him successful pushed aside the slump he had faced for a few years.
“I thought he tried to get ahead of himself in the last three or four years, where he was trying to outdo what he’s good at and sometimes, it can catch up on you. But he’s back to what he does best, which is take the singles, hit the ball along the ground, if necessary, go for the big one. Some of the greatest players who played the one-day game, especially in the chase, are guys who can do that,” said Shastri.
He then added, “When you pick up singles with ease, there’s no pressure. And then when you have another guy at the other end, someone like Shreyas (Iyer) who comes and smacks it, it takes the pressure off, it becomes easier.”

Title: Champions Trophy Final: Which Indian Top Cat can bell Kane Williamson who has 50+ in every ICC ODI outing against India?

“…They know this place, don’t they? They are everywhere”
This was Kane Williamson talking about cats that snuck into the press conference room after New Zealand’s semifinal against South Africa and walked right across to stop at his feet. But felines aside, the statement could well apply to Indian spinners in Dubai.
So who can bell the Kiwi talisman – Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav or Axar Patel? Or will it be Md Shami early on?
The cats in Pakistan had sure distracted Williamson. Here’s how his presser went:
“Conditions changed little bit throughout…<pause, chuckle, pointing to back of the room&gt; Somebody’s cat there… <head shake> For us you know, it was nice to have the last match, and India are an outstanding team, and for us to have…. <pause, chuckle deep breath> …so for us, it’s important we just…. <looks at cat that’s arrived at his feet> They know this place well don’t they, they are everywhere!
“And yea, so…it’s important we take lessons from that last game (vs India). It’s a final, anything can happen. There was a great atmosphere I’m sure it should be good again,” he said.
Earlier in Dubai, where NZ lost to India, Williamson’s 81 had made him the NZ batter with the most fifty-plus scores against India in ODI cricket, according to stats sourced by newsbytesapp.com. They quoted ESPN as Williamson breaking “the tie with Ross Taylor, who had retired with 11 such scores against India.”
As per the website, Nathan Astle is the only other New Zealand batter to have scored 10 or more 50-plus scores against India in this format.
Williamson currently boasts (or humble brags) 11 fifties besides a ton. He tallies  1,228 runs from 30 ODIs against India at an average of 45.48. His strike rate of 75.56 and points to his anchoring duties and is clearly low. He also averages lower 34.80 in Asia against India, compared to 58.09 at home (639 runs).
While he had a match-winning 67 in the 2019 World Cup semi-final, the star batter scored 69 in a losing cause in the 2023 WC semi-final, following it with 81 in the first CT league game. He is pretty consistent against India in high-profile games, and 655 of his have come in victories over India, cranking up his average to a stunning 59.54.
In losing causes versus India, he has 508 runs at 33.86 and is equally potent in both innings – averaging 46.46 batting first, and leading run chases with 44.25, as per stats by newsbytesapp.com.
After the semifinals, with the cat purring post-match, Williamson joined an exclusive club en route to his 15th ODI ton, as per Stuff.com.  “It’s more significant than becoming the first player to score a hat-trick of centuries against South Africa. Williamson became the 16th player, and first Kiwi, to score 19,000 runs in international cricket, a list topped by Indian great Sachin Tendulkar (34,357). The former Black Caps skipper was the fourth fastest (440 innings) to join the list of run-scoring machines, with only Indians Virat Kohli (399) and Tendulkar (432) and West Indian Brian Lara (433) ahead of him,” Stuff wrote.

India vs New Zealand Today Match, Champions Trophy Final 2025 Detailed Analysis: New Zealand got off to a strong start with the bat after winning the toss before Rohit Sharma’s India bounced back with a string of wickets in the final of the Champions Trophy in Dubai.
Total dominance
After going a decade without a major ICC trophy, India has now gone three tournaments losing just one game. After going for years being maligned for faltering in big games, India has of late truly become a big-game outfit. The defeat in the 2023 50-over World Cup, painful as it was for the team and the players involved, seems to have spurred something in them as they haven’t lost a match in an ICC event since then. Not even losing all five tosses in the tournament could prevent their utter dominance, as India always found someone for every occasion. Judging by the swagger with which Hardik Pandya went about dealing with a potentially tricky situation, when the team is on a long winning streak, they don’t even countenance the possibility that they could lose. India is prevailing not just in ICC boardrooms and stands, but now also on the field.

Tide-changer
After a whirlwind start that made the chase seem almost like a cakewalk, three quick wickets and a succession of tight overs had brought the final on more of an even keel. The four-pronged Kiwi spin attack was threatening to do an India on India, as the asking rate reached almost a run a ball. Something needed to be done to change the tempo of the game, and Shreyas Iyer took the mantle upon himself. With off-spinner Glenn Phillips turning the ball into him, he went for a hoick over mid-wicket. At most grounds it would have been a sure six, but the bigger Dubai field kept the boundary fielder, Will Young interested. He got his hand to the ball as he was toppling over the fence. He chucked the ball inside, but not before his feet touched the skirting. What could have been a wicket became a six, and the tide turned. Iyer and Axar Patel got entrenched, got their regular singles and the required boundaries. Another catch dropped off Iyer, a much easier one by Kyle Jamieson signalled the tilt in the balance of power in the game as the largely India supporters in the crowd found their voice again.
No surprise then that when Rachin Ravindran finally held onto a Shreyas catch for 48, a few sweet nothings escaped his indecipherable lips.
– Tushar Bhaduri
Change in mood
The way the Indian chase started, it seemed as the result was a foregone conclusion. The flurry of early boundaries, mostly from Rohit Sharma’s bat, prompted frenzy and excitement in the stands. It appeared to be a question of how quickly, and not if, India would get to the target. There was speculation over whether the skipper would get to a hundred in the final. Even when Virat Kohli came to the middle after Shubman Gill’s dismissal, with the total already past 100, some wondered whether there was an opportunity for him to get a ton as well. But it doesn’t take much for the mood to change in a game of cricket. Three relatively quick wickets induced tension in the proceedings and the anxiety among the India supporters could be ascertained from the fact that they were now cheering singles walked by Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel, as the Kiwi spinners and fielders made them earn every run.
Tushar Bhaduri
Dot… dot… dot… and gone
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that’ll never stop… goes the lyric of a song in Encanto. In India’s case, it went like dot, dot, dot… and more dots. In the 25th over, Rachin Ravindra conceded a single off the first ball. That was followed by five dots as Rohit struggled to put him away, one attempted sweep in that over nearly squeezed through for a LBW. It was the first sign of Rohit not being in a comfortable space. In the next over, Shreyas Iyer nearly lobbed one back to Michael Bracewell as the ball stopped on him. It was a maiden over. 11 straight dot balls. At the start of the 27th over NZ reaped the reward. Rohit danced down against Rachin and was well beaten by the length, the ball turning past him and the Indian captain was stumped. 12th straight dot, and set batter gone. That was followed by 7 more dots… and nearly another wicket as Shreyas Iyer tried to break the shackles. He was nearly caught at deep midwicket, but it ended up being a six despite Will Young’s super effort.

His Airness, neo No 23 or Jonty sequel of 2025?
A chase that was placed well and going at brisk pace was halted and it was halted by a flying beauty from none other than the superman Glenn Phillips.
As Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill moved along swiftly in the chase against New Zealand, they needed something special and Glenn Phillips did exactly that. He plucked a catch out of thin air, from behind his head, to dismiss Gill off Mitchell Santner.
It was a flighted ball which was drilled towards cover by Gill but Glenn Phillips’ jump in the air and came as divine intervention. His reaction time was 0.78 seconds.
The catch was a photographer’s delight, an acrobat’s arch as  Phillips was like a silk ribbon caught in breeze, absolutely fluid. The 28-year-old has made it a habit now. Displaying acrobatic skills on the field, day in and day out.
Be it the catch of Rizwan in the opening game of the tournament or the catch to dismiss Virat Kohli in the group game, he glides and flows on the field much like a paintbrush painting a picture.
If Kohli’s catch was from another world, it looked like he plucked Gill’s catch from another realm.
His celebration was pretty down-to-earth though: crossing his hands and feet, while still sitting on the ground, and a happy smile pasted on his face. Not smug. Just content.

Gill dances down
It is not often you see Shubman Gill bat out the entire first powerplay and not score a boundary. With the Rohit Sharma Show well and truly on in Dubai, Gill could afford to take his time, the best seat in the house being the non-striker’s end. At the end of the first 10 overs, Rohit had hit five fours and three sixes in the 40 balls he had taken strike for. Gill on the other hand was on 10 off 20 balls. But when Gill decided to take charge, the wait was worth it, because it was arguably the cleanest strike of the day. He saw one flighted by Rachin Ravindra, decided to give the charge, and despite New Zealand having a fielder at long on in place, cleared the fence with effortless ease. The first of many straight, sweetly-timed sixes with the new MRF bat – one that has a special place in Indian cricket – that he started playing with from the semifinals, one imagines.

Rohit ‘Hitman’ Sharma takes the bounty on NZ bowlers
Indian skipper Rohit Sharma has embraced a style of playing with attacking intent irrespective of the situation.
Staying true to his moniker ‘Hitman’, Rohit came all guns blazing in the chase with a six on the second ball as he pulled Kyle Jamieson to the backward of square leg. He continued with the blitzkrieg as he hit two fours to William O’Rourke in the next over.
Rohit took a liking for Nathan Smith, replacement of Matt Henry, scoring two sixes and two fours against him in the powerplay.
The first six against Smith in the 6th over when Rohit charged down, flew 92m, his immaculate ability of hitting sixes on display.
Charging down to the pacers has been one of the regular weapons in Rohit’s arsenal of attacking cricket. Since January 2022, Rohit has scored 119 runs charging down the track to the pacers in just 39 balls with a gigantic strike rate of 305. While attempting the shot, he has got out just thrice showing the perfect execution from him. India scored 64/0 in the ten overs of the first powerplay. Sharma reached his 50 in just 41 balls just after the powerplay ended.

Bracewell goes well
At one point, after five wickets fell, India looked well and truly on top in the final against New Zealand. And then there was a recovery. That was the story in 2000 in Nairobi. Twenty five years back, it was Chris Cairns who scored an unbeaten century to break Indian hearts in the ICC Knock Out, as it was called back then. It wasn’t quite that sort of innings but Michael Bracewell is cut from the same cloth as generations of New Zealand cricketers who are equally effective with the bat and ball. Coming in at No 7, the spin-bowling-hard-hitting utility cricketer scored a smart 53 off 40 balls, to revive New Zealand’s batting effort that was heading nowhere for a large part of the afternoon in Dubai. Only Bracewell – and to a lesser extent Glenn Phillips – were able to break the shackles that were firmly in place after the early onslaught from Rachin Ravindra. Bracewell’s two sixes were especially sweetly timed, clearing the boundary comfortably, as he took a heavy toll on the last few overs of pace from India’s seamers. Thanks to him, 79/2 in the last 10 overs pushed New Zealand past the 250-mark. Fighters, aren’t they?

Sweep, reverse or otherwise, fails Latham
Tom Latham’s reputation as a solid middle-over batter was built on his ability to play spin, especially use the sweep and reverse sweep to great effect. But in back-to-back matches, he found the going tough against Ravindra Jadeja, a notoriously hard bowler to sweep because of his metronomic accuracy. In the league-stage match last week, Latham attempted the reverse sweep against the left-arm spinner, and cramped himself for room, missed the turning ball and was out LBW. Fast forward to the final, the batter opted for the conventional sweep, missed one that slid on straight, and was again trapped plumb in front. Jadeja knew immediately he had his man, and brought out his version of the ‘celebrappeal’ and umpire Paul Reiffel – who had correctly ruled out another LBW appeal in the previous Jadeja over against Latham – agreed. The former Australian pacer is nicknamed ‘Pistol’ and wasted no time in raising his hand. The review didn’t save Latham. “Latham generally plays that shot well, but in Dubai it’s been tough going for him,” Dinesh Karthik said on air. India’s spin-choke continued.

All hugs for Kuldeep
A video did the rounds on social media during India vs Australia semifinal. Virat Kohli charged in from the deep to pick up a ball and fire in a throw to the non-striker’s end where Kuldeep Yadav was standing. As the ball got closer to him, Kuldeep took a step back and let it go, presumably because he wanted to protect his bowling hand. The ball then made its way to Rohit Sharma who was backing up on the other side of the wicket. The current Indian captain and former Indian captain were both left unhappy at Kuldeep’s decision and were caught on broadcast giving the spinner an earful, you didn’t have to be an expert lip-reader to understand the scolding. On Sunday in the final, it was all hugs and cheers for Kuldeep though. He hasn’t had the best of tournaments so far, but in his first two overs in the big clash, he removed the big wickets of Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson. And was promptly mobbed by his teammates on both occasions, plenty of affection in the air.

Cool-deep is the coolest of Indian wristies
Young Rachin Ravindra was on a roll against India in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. He took Hardik Pandya to the cleaners in the fourth over with one six and two fours. In the next over, he struck two fours against Shami.
Highest run scorer of the tournament, Rachin has been in supreme form with centuries in the group stage and in the semi-final. Him scoring runs meant that captain Rohit Sharma had a lot to worry. After his boundary spree, Rachin got two reprieves as Shami dropped his catch on follow through and Shreyas Iyer dropped a skier off Varun Chakaravarthy’s bowling.
Usually brought late into the attack, skipper Rohit Sharma brought in Kuldeep Yadav ahead of Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja. Enduring a tough tournament performance wise, Kuldeep made all the difference on the first ball as Rachin failed to read the googly and missed it as it flicked off his back leg before crashing on the stumps. The Indian team was ecstatic knowing the value of the wicket. Kuldeep didn’t stop there as he got the wicket of Kane Williamson in the next over. Williamson had scored a half century in the last match against India but got out for a meagre 11 this time as Kuldeep invited him to drive with a full ball on the middle and the Kiwi batter pushed it back to Kuldeep who made no mistake in taking the catch.

Varun’s deception of speed – from mid-80s to 99
Varun Chakaravarthy is not only about cryptic variations, but also about well-disguised change of pace and smart manoeuvring of the crease. The Will Young delivery—a non-turning leg-break—was all about his angle. He delivered it from a little away from the stumps, not quite from the edge of the crease, but at an arm’s length from the umpire. The angle deceived Young, who was already fretting about his variations, unable to read him off his wrists but reacting to deviations from the surface. So the moment he read the line was towards the stumps, he thrust his front foot, semi-forward and tried to work him across the stumps. The basic set-up meant that he would end up playing around the front-pad, which he did. Then kicked in Varun’s deception of speed. This one clocked 99kph, whereas most deliveries to him were in the mid 80s. The ball snuck past the bat and skidded straight onto the front pad. Usually, Young is an assured player of spin on his back-foot. But he had slashed a Varun ball onto the stumps in the previous game. So perhaps, his half-forward press this time.
– Sandip G
Virat’s fielding suggestion to Rohit
Virat Kohli shouted out, ‘Rohit Rohit’ just as the new batsman Daryl Mitchell walked past him to take guard, after the fall of Rachin Ravindra. Kohli then cupped his palms together to suggest a close-in catcher. Rohit must have been unmoved for Kohli once again gestured, this time after the iffy forward prods of a batsman. No luck, for now as the captain didn’t agree and Kohli went back to his spot. In the last over, he had signalled to Rohit to swap positions; Kohli was at midwicket and after Kane Williamson had tapped one past square-leg, he wanted to field there, and asked Rohit to come over. That time the captain had agreed.
– Sriram Veera
Pain for Shami and India
Rachin Ravindra was perhaps the big wicket India needed early in Dubai but the left-handed opener was off to a stylish start. But India offered their helping hands. In the 7th over, Rachin punched one straight back to Mohammed Shami who put both his hands up but the ball flicked his left little finger, causing him to flinch in pain. The pacer had dropped two chances in the semifinal against Australia too off his own bowling, including one off Travis Head in the first over. “One to his right, one to his left and now one through the middle,” former England captain Nasser Hussain described it on air as footage of the three dropped catches was played. It brought India’s catching efficiency in the tournament down to 72%. That would have gone down further as Shreyas Iyer dropped one at deep midwicket when Rachin mistimed a slog sweep in the next over. Having made good ground to his right, Shreyas misjudged the flight of the ball and found himself stretching for the final step, got both hands to it but couldn’t hold on. For the record, New Zealand sat pretty at the top with a 91% catching efficiency.

Rachin run-ka-ching starts ringing
Rachin Ravindra with 226 had the second-most number of runs in this ICC Champions Trophy coming into the final against India. In three balls against Hardik Pandya, he showed exactly what his ODI rise has been all about. The first came from a back of the length ball that Pandya directed towards him, one that he calmly stood and pulled away at. At 134 clicks, Pandya gave him the time to stand, deliver and look downright regal while doing all of it. Five centuries in ICC tournaments and an average of 67 across World Cup and CT matches (804 runs in 13 innings), is exactly the reason why New Zealand place so much faith in him. The next ball was dispatched to the boundary as well, this time a square drive that he attacked on the move. Pandya responded with a wide and then saw his last ball of the over pulled at again. The Kiwi southpaw didn’t get the same power from bat onto ball as he had earlier in the over but the ball bounced once before heading out of the boundary ropes. The customary camera pan to a worried Rohit Sharma ensued – one of many this innings possibly?

Title: ‘Varun Chakaravarthy is going to be the challenge’: Nasser Hussain warns New Zealand ahead of Champions Trophy final vs India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/varun-chakaravarthy-is-going-to-be-the-challenge-nasser-hussain-warns-new-zealand-ahead-of-champions-trophy-final-vs-india-9876707/
Content:
Former England skipper and cricket pundit Nasser Hussain has warned New Zealand to be wary of India’s mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy in the Champions Trophy 2025 final, which will be played in Dubai on Sunday.
Speaking with Michael Atherton and Ian Ward on Sky Sports, Hussain said, “Not many of the New Zealand line-up had seen Varun Chakaravarthy in that group stage. They have now. He is tricky when you’ve not seen him before, so that’s going to be a challenge for them.
India have been playing with four spinners — Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun — and this has seemed to be working in Rohit Sharma’s Men In Blue’s favour on a tacky surface of Dubai.
Hussain also heaped praise on India’s spin-bowling set-up and the variety they offer. He said, “They (India’s four spinners) are (all different), and two of them are genuine all-rounders. Before they set off out here, Rohit was asked why you need so many spinners. They’ve got Washington Sundar as well. They could play because New Zealand have got so many left-handers. India might want that extra off-spin option, but they may not change those four.
“They give you so much, but also it’s about the speed. I think in New Zealand, the flight and guile of someone like Mitchell Santner or Adil Rashid here in Dubai as the pitch being a bit slower and lower and turning, you want a slightly quicker spinner. So the likes of Varun, who got a fifer in the last group game against New Zealand, and Ravindra Jadeja are vital,” he added.
Varun registered exceptional figures of 10-0-42-5 against New Zealand during their group-stage match. His Player of the Match performance helped India beat the Kiwis by 44 runs.
The mystery spinner, who only played two matches so far in the eight-team tournament, has picked up seven wickets and is in third place in the most-wicket charts behind compatriot Mohammed Shami and New Zealand’s Matt Henry, whose participation in the final is doubtful after sustaining a shoulder injury during the semi-final against South Africa in Lahore.

Title: Michael Atherton on Champions Trophy 2025 Final: ‘India favourites, New Zealand are coming after playing in Pakistan’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-favourites-michael-atherton-champions-trophy-final-new-zealand-pakistan-9876582/
Content:
Former England captain Michael Atherton believes that team India are a clear ‘favourite’ to win the Champions Trophy 2025 final in Dubai against New Zealand who are coming after playing their semi-final in Pakistan.
Rohit Sharma-led team India will take on New Zealand, captained by Mitchell Santner in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
“India are favourites without question. They’re unbeaten in the tournament and playing at the ground (Dubai) where they’ve had lots of exposure, whereas New Zealand have gone to Pakistan for their semi-final and come back,” said Atherton to SkySports.
“India are a complete team. It is hard to look at that team and think of any weaknesses,” Atherton said about Men in Blue who will play their fourth final since 2023. “They’ve got an aggressive and good opening partnership. They’ve got the best ODI player in the history of the game at number three. They’ve got an in-form Shreyas Iyer at four. Then they’ve got a whole host of all-rounders that give them both variety with the ball and depth with the bat, and Mohamed Shami’s return means that they haven’t really missed Jasprit Bumrah that much, so it is a complete team,” he added.
India did not travel to the host country Pakistan for security reasons and played all its group games, the semi-final and now the final too, in Dubai. Pakistan and the ICC didn’t think it best to split India’s games across other venues in the UAE for financial reasons.
The square at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium has progressively slowed down. Australia’s 264 in the first semifinal was the highest first-innings total here in the Champions Trophy — chased down by India with 11 balls to spare.
When India and New Zealand clashed here in their group game last Sunday, the ball hardly bounced up more than the knee in the second innings. Spin, thus, will play a key role in determining the outcome of this final.

Title: Rashid Latif asks former England cricketers to stop whinging about Champions Trophy schedule: ‘Begaani shaadi mey abdullah deewana’

Content:
Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has launched a scathing attack on former England cricketers Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, and David Lloyd for their claims that India has an ‘undeniable advantage’ and that the ICC Champions Trophy schedule is ‘rigged’ to favor the Rohit Sharma-led team, which played all its matches in Dubai.
India did not travel to host country Pakistan for security reasons and played all its group games, the semifinal, and now the final, in Dubai. 1  Pakistan and the ICC deemed it best not to split India’s games across other venues in the UAE for financial reasons.
“If we (Pakistan) are talking about India having an advantage, you get it. But why are former England cricketers whinging about it now? Begaani shaadi mein abdullah deewana (They are trying to be overly involved in someone else’s affairs),’ Rashid Latif said on the show ‘Caught Behind.’
Latif then explained the scheduling problem for the ongoing Champions Trophy.
“Yes, there was a problem with scheduling. On Saturday, March 2nd, India played New Zealand in Dubai. If India had played that match a day earlier, when England played South Africa (on March 1st) in Karachi, then the semifinal lineup would have been decided easily.
“It was a blunder from the ICC and all the stakeholders. You have one job: to check the schedule, and you missed the mistake. Once you agreed, and now your team is out, you are whinging.
“All the representatives of the cricket boards are to blame. You should not go to the ICC meeting to have a good time. Do your job properly.
“If India is getting all the support, but you all agreed to it, let’s say we Pakistanis are making excuses because of jealousy, but the rest of the world should not moan about this issue. You all agreed to this schedule.
“They are trying to create an unnecessary controversy,” he said.

New Zealand playing a game prior to the final in Dubai will give some idea of the conditions on what to expect compared to Australia who had played their first game at the venue in the semifinal. However, to be fair New Zealand did play a good game against India though it was their first time compared to India already playing a couple of games before it. They were bamboozled by Varun Chakarvarthy’s willy wrist spin in that group game who played a pivotal role in India’s win.

How will the pitch play?
The Dubai wicket has been a low-scoring surface compared to the wickets in Pakistan. The pitch has been conducive to the spinners and once the ball gets older and softer in the final overs batting has become a lot harder when compared with the new ball in the powerplay. Hence regardless of the first innings or second innings teams would want to capitalize in the first 10 overs when the ball is new and hard.
How will the weather play?
The temperature is expected to be around 32 degrees centigrade for the game according to the Accuweather app. There has not been much dew in the second innings at this venue. With the temperature as high as it is and the pressure of the final the teams winning the toss might look to opt to bat first and put runs on the board.
Squads:
India Squad: Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh Pant

Title: Sluggish surfaces are not the only reason Rohit Sharma is struggling to score runs in the Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sluggish-surfaces-are-not-the-only-reason-rohit-sharma-is-struggling-to-score-runs-in-the-champions-trophy-9876514/
Content:
Two awkwardly tall fast bowlers, a hard-length merchant, a left-arm spinning master of drop and his utilitarian cronies present a compellingly stiff examination for Rohit Sharma, battling an uncharacteristic slump in an ICC tournament. It is not so much the lack of runs and hundreds that would annoy him, as his diminished capacity to set the tone with heavy riffs. The four outings have earned him only 104 runs at a strike rate of 107. The hitting rate is healthy, but his premature departure, floundering in the 20s (and a 40), has inflated the burden on Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli.
In the 50-over World Cup in 2023, he played the dual roles of both attacking and safeguarding his wicket with imperceptible comfort. He faced an average of 43 balls per game (and hit at 126), whereas in Dubai, the corresponding numbers are 24 and 107.
He had to counter diverse challenges in this tournament.
A) The surfaces have been a trifle sluggish for his attacking tastes. Even the new ball gets stuck on the deck, driving on the rise as well as unboxing the pick-up pull risky business. The inherent sluggishness girdles his turbocharged impulses.
B) Bowlers, gleaning lessons from the ODI World Cup, have devised methods to contain. In this tournament, they have probed him with back-of-length balls at stumps.
Plans to induce a nick behind had been long shelved, and unless one could bend late and big, fuller lengths were eschewed. Shaheen Shah Afridi did and cracked his stumps. Then it is Shaheen Shah Afridi. C) The battle with the self. He is so much intoxicated by the hyper-aggressive avatar that he has estranged himself from a steadier approach that marked his mid-career highs.
His approach in the final, thus, would produce a layered and fascinating watch.
Kyle Jamieson is six feet eight inches; his Canterbury colleague Will O’ Rourke six feet, six inches. The release points are unnervingly high, the ball descends from a height of roughly 2.5 metres. Extra bounce is a natural virtue. But extra bounce from hard and good lengths make them tougher to nullify. It’s the reason Rohit tried to work Jamieson through the square regions on the off-side, playing from the back-foot. He deserted his favourite method of sashaying down the track and cuffing through covers (or smearing through midwicket), because the ploy is counterproductive, for their height makes it onerously difficult to get on top of the bounce.
Maneuvering their pace and gliding them behind — as Rohit is splendidly capable of — could be a more practical route to the fence. The asset works on a practical and psychological level. Batsmen are wary of pulling and hooking them, because of the extra bounce they coax off the surface. They are careful of driving them because even when the ball is there to be driven they often fail to get fully forward, bringing the edge into play.
The pull, if employed smartly, could be an effective ploy. In the group fixture, Jamieson lured him into mistiming a pull. The slowness of the ball defeated him as much as the extra bounce. He staggered the ball to mid-wicket. Both elements threw his balance off-kilter, resulting in an uncontrolled pull. The favourite stroke of his has been undoing him frequently in recent times. A reason could be that he is trying to hit them in front of square, on the front foot, rather than swivelling and using the pace to target the arc behind square leg and fine leg (as he did to Naseem Shah in the Pakistan game). Against slower, shorter bowlers it could work, but not against a pair pelting leather from the skies.
To the gift of height add healthy pace, ability to seam both ways and accuracy, Jamieson and O’Rourke present a magnificently unique test.
The improbability of Matt Henry featuring in the final would relieve Rohit, but Jacob Duffy is more than a standard workhorse. The strapping seamer from Southland could plug away in mid-130kph, pounding the hard-length with a high degree of precision. Don’t be fooled by the speedometer. The ball comes faster at the batsmen than they think. He is not a one-length pony either. Sucking the batsmen to the back-foot, he hurls in a full and fiery out-swinger.
Against him, you could visualise Rohit bounding out of the crease and flaying through cover or flapping via mid-wicket. But beware of his heavy ball that thuds into the splice.
The Indian captain has faced just four balls of spin bowling this tournament. All came against Australia greenhorn Connor Connolly. He eked out just a run and got out sweeping the left-arm orthodox spinner. The Kiwis pack would pose tougher questions. Mitchell Santner is a wizard of drift and drop, creating the illusion that the ball is there but not there. He deceives with change of pace, angle of release and overs-spin. Glenn Phillips is irritatingly flat, difficult to cut and Michael Bracewell infuriatingly disciplined. Rohit, if he survives the height onslaught, would look to sweep them off the length or step out to loft down the ground. Whether his eyes and reflexes rebel against the brain’s wishes has to be seen. Either way, his score in the final has the capacity to both sustain and destroy his career.

Title: WPL 2025: Richa Ghosh, Sneh Rana shine but it’s the hope that kills as RCB’s playoff bid ends
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-2025-richa-ghosh-sneh-rana-rcb-playoff-hopes-end-upw-9876236/
Content:
Batting on 61 off 29, in the middle of the 16th over, Richa Ghosh took count of the fielding changes, then took a couple of deep breaths, calming herself down. Next ball, as Chinelle Henry strayed down the leg side, Ghosh just casually flicked the ball, and deposited it over the fence. RCB’s hopes of staying alive depended on her capable shoulders carrying the load of a mega run-chase.
Next over, however, when Deepti Sharma bowled one in her arc, her eyes lit up and she went for another big heave over midwicket. But, this time, Henry was waiting. In a tournament where their catching was forgettable for the most part, the West Indies allrounder grabbed the ball cleanly and fell on her back, arms spread across in joy – and relief. Even though Sneh Rana smashed the first five balls she faced for two fours and three sixes in a stunning cameo to give her side hope, RCB’s tournament effectively ended when Ghosh’s knock came to an end. UP Warriorz scored the highest Women’s Premier League total after being asked to bat first, posting 225/5 riding on Georgia Voll’s 99*. RCB gave it a good chase but fell short by 12 runs.
UPW were already out of the playoffs race, and this result finished off RCB’s chances too. Delhi Capitals, Mumbai Indians, and Gujarat Giants are confirmed to play in the knockouts, with the top spot – a direct entry to the final – still up for grabs for the three teams.
RCB’s night started off well as Smriti Mandhana finally won a toss after losing all four in Bengaluru (and ended up losing all those matches as well). But the smile she had at the toss vanished rather quickly as UPW were off to a flying start. Grace Harris and Georgia Voll found boundaries with an alarming frequency. If the first half of the powerplay was about Grace’s power, Voll soon stepped on the gas too. With a total of 11 fours and 2 sixes in the powerplay, UPW registered the best score of the season at the end of six overs (at that point) with 67/0.
UPW’s problem through the season, however, has been converting these starts into a substantial total. But in their final match, they found the right rhythm in their batting. After Harris’ run out, Kiran Navgire played her best innings of the tournament too, showing her big-hitting abilities with back-to-back sixes off Georgia Wareham. Not long after, came a 22-run over from Renuka Singh Thakur as Navgire showcased some easy power to smash a couple more sixes in her 16-ball 46.
Voll’s incredible ball-striking is not new for Indian fans, as she scored a century in only her second ODI for Australia. And it seemed she was on her way to scoring the first century of the WPL but the 90s curse struck again. Just in Lucknow this past week, Beth Mooney (96* for Gujarat Giants) and Meg Lanning (92 for Delhi Capitals) came close but Voll went even closer. But after finding the boundary with ease for the majority of her innings, she couldn’t do enough in the last couple of overs, and was left stranded on 99. What mattered, however, was the score UPW posted that was out of RCB’s reach.
For the defending champions, it brought the curtains down (effectively, as they still have one match to go) on a poor season. Their problems started even before a ball was bowled, as the top three wicket-takers of WPL 2024 in Shreyanka Patil, Asha Sobhana and Sophie Molineux were all ruled out. They started off alright despite those blows, winning two matches in Vadodara. But the season fully derailed once their home games began.
“We started believing it was going to be a good season, but in the last five matches, we couldn’t meet our own expectations,” a dejected Mandhana said later. “We played well in patches but lost key moments, losing matches we could have won. There’s definitely a lot to take back from the season. Losing the top three wicket-takers of last season was significant, especially after the auction.”

Her own form with the bat didn’t help RCB either. After the joy of 2024, it turned out to be a forgettable campaign. On UPW’s night in Lucknow, RCB would be left feeling it is the hope that kills.

Title: India vs New Zealand final preview: Why Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli had a intense meeting on field before the Champions Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-nz-champions-trophy-final-preview-rohit-kohli-gambhir-9876203/
Content:
On Saturday afternoon where India had a relaxed training session, a meeting involving head coach Gautam Gambhir, skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli near the pitch got everyone curious. Going by their gestures, the discussion seemed to be about the pitch for the final and whether India will have to make any switches as they seek to end their ICC title drought in the 50-over format.
Though India are totally familiar with the dry square here in Dubai, against Australia Rohit had admitted that they were confused whether to bat first or second as they were unsure how the fresh pitch would behave. For the final, there seems to be a similar confusion, particularly after how the conditions have changed here in Dubai. Right through the last three weeks, the temperature has remained pleasant with evenings being particularly chill and at times cold because of the strong breeze. However, since Thursday, the chillness has disappeared and instead the thermometer levels have been rising again upto 10 degrees.
What it is going to do on the surface now is the biggest intrigue that is confronting India. As was evident against Australia, the pitch showed signs of getting better and if it does remain hot, then there is also a strong chance of dew that could then aid the team that bats second. In such a case, India may have to go back to the drawing board to have a re-think around their four-spinner strategy which they have employed in the last two matches. When they do so, one question will definitely crop up. Why change something that isn’t broken? Playing four spinners not only strengthens their bowling, but also provides them with an edge over New Zealand.
Gearing 🆙 for the #Final ⏳#TeamIndia | #ChampionsTrophy2025 pic.twitter.com/gFovpyLGoy
— BCCI (@BCCI) March 8, 2025
So far in this campaign, India have played near flawless cricket, overcoming each of the challenges they have faced with aplomb. With each match, the level of their opponents has increased, but India have still managed to eclipse them on the back of a strong squad at their disposal. And as has been the story so far, for the final, they will face another unique challenge, with the match being played on the same strip that was used for India’s match against Pakistan two weeks back. And therein lies the puzzle to decode.
How much the pitch is playing in their minds was evident during their training session on the eve of the match. First up the spin trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav had a close look at the pitch. Then their head coach Gautam Gambhir followed suit. Shortly afterwards, Rohit who was having a net session at the ICC Academy would drop in and head straight to the pitch before he had that lengthy conversation with Gambhir. After about 20 minutes of animated conversation, Rohit called out to Kohli, who was playing foot-volley until then. For the next 10 minutes or so, the three remained in a huddle, with Rohit and Kohli seemingly looking to be on the same page. But that’s a guess from afar.
And winning the T20 World Cup last year also seems to have eased the pressure on the side. “Yes, definitely,” Gill would say whether the title freed up the pressure element.
“Sometimes once you get one title, that kind of breaks the jinx and gives you the momentum; you are also not very desperate about getting the title. It’s not good when desperation kicks in as then it’s hard to put the occasion out of the equation. In all these big matches, the players or the teams that can put aside the pressure and the occasion have a better chance of winning it. And I think winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry, but I think it kind of makes us more balanced. That yes, we have won an ICC title, and we’ll try to do our best to win this one,” Gill said.
Whatever it is, what is certain is India are in the final, fully prepared. Like the 2023 World Cup, they have brushed aside each and every opponent and have overcome all sorts of situations they have faced. And more importantly, unlike the World Cup where the team balance was certainly lacking in Hardik Pandya’s absence, here they have all bases covered. From No 1 to 11, they have players not only assigned for specific roles, but also match-winners in their own way. Of course, New Zealand will no doubt present a stiff challenge, for man for man they are no less and their fielding will be tough to match up.


A post shared by ICC (@icc)
No wonder R Ashwin in his YouTube channel would say, “I am still having nerves. I am not having the greatest of feelings. After New Zealand’s win against South Africa, I am feeling that once again they can hurt us”.
Having already played here, New Zealand are not in a blind spot as to what to expect. Though they are still concerned about the availability of their pacer Matt Henry, the presence of a strong spin attack and batsmen, who are equipped to ace these conditions, will ensure they won’t be any pushovers.

Last time they met, the match up of their batsmen against the Indian spin quartet is what settled the outcome and even on Sunday it may well be the case. “I think we have to kind of go in with an open mind of how the pitch will play, and then adjust accordingly,” New Zealand captain Mitchell Santer said. “We’ve seen throughout this tournament if you keep wickets in hand, and then you can really set up a death phase with the bat. So, I think there will be periods throughout this game on both sides where you’re under pressure for a period of time. But if you can kind of withstand that and get through it might get easier.” Easier said than done of course but the team that manages to do that – hold their nerve- will triumph.

Title: STAT ALERT: UP Warriorz break record for highest WPL total, Georgia Voll misses first ever century by a run
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-highest-total-up-warriorz-record-rcb-georgia-voll-9876100/
Content:
Royal Challengers Bengaluru were once again at the receiving end of a big total in the Women’s Premier League. Already, they held the record for conceding the highest total in the tournament history as well as in the third edition so far. And both those marks were beaten by a belligerent UP Warriorz side. Already eliminated from the playoff race, and playing their last match of the tournament in their backyard in Lucknow, UPW smashed 225/5, the highest score in WPL so far, breaking Delhi Capitals’ 223/2 against RCB at the Brabourne Stadium in 2023.
But another record fell just short at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow: the wait for the first WPL century continued. Georgia Voll slammed an unbeaten 99, equaling the highest individual score of Sophie Devine. Beth Mooney (Gujarat Giants, 96*) and Meg Lanning (Delhi Capitals, 92) were also close to the landmark in Lucknow this week.
Voll was in superb form, striking 17 fours and one six in her 56-ball knock, leading a stellar top-order performance. Kiran Navgire (46 off 16 balls), Grace Harris (39 off 22), and Chinelle Henry (19 off 15) were the other contributors after UPW were asked to bat first.

Georgia Wareham (2/43) took two wickets, but RCB failed to build any pressure.
RCB, who had lost their last four matches (all at home in Bengaluru), saw skipper Smriti Mandhana win the toss, but Voll and Harris took full advantage of it, posting the highest powerplay score of the season, reaching 67/0. UPW made the most of the short boundaries at the Ekana, targeting the right areas as RCB bowlers could barely exert any control from start tot finish.

RCB, along with UPW, will get knocked out of the tournament with a defeat on Saturday.

Title: All eyes on Virat Kohli: Why this Champions Trophy final is important for ODI’s king
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-final-virat-kohli-ind-vs-nz-odi-king-9876087/
Content:
Roughly around 4:40pm, after a two-hour net session at the Dubai cricket stadium, Virat Kohli stepped into the team bus that was parked right outside the dressing room. Not far from the bus, a kid perched on his father’s shoulders let out a desperate cry: “Kohli bhaiya…please ek ticket dedo,” (please give me a ticket) drawing chuckles.
Moments later, Kohli stepped out of the bus, headed towards that kid to pose for a photograph and put his signature on the kid’s cap. In a rare instance, for the next couple of minutes, Kohli would go about engaging with each of his fans before disappearing. Not just young kids, but adults have been losing their heads in admiration at his fabulous run in this tournament.
Last month in Pakistan, a photo of a couple had gone viral. They were clad in jerseys in Pakistan colours but with a twist: the name and the number on the back was Virat Kohli and 18. The sales and sightings of his No.18 jersey have been tremendous, unsurprisingly.
“In the past as well, when India came here, we always got a lot of takers for the merchandise. This time, thanks to Kohli, it has been even bigger. In the past three weeks, we have sold over 100 T-shirts here alone,” says Jamal, who runs a store.
The importance of this final for Kohli can’t be downplayed; the greatest ODI batsman has had a rather skewed relationship with the title clashes in ICC tournaments in the 50-over format, where he averages just 35 in four innings. The 54 he scored in the 2023 World Cup final remains his highest. But he has already started well in Dubai with a match-winning 84 in the semifinal against Australia; just one more game awaits.
The backdrop to the tournament too can’t be understated. He was part of the Indian team that went down tamely to New Zealand at home in a historic 0-3 Test series whitewash. Very soon, he faced more hurt and embarrassment in Australia where his touch and judgement deserted him, often getting dismissed chasing balls outside off stump. That tour would go down for a few unpleasant images: the infamous shoulder barge with a teenager Sam Konstas, his duels with the barracking Australian crowds, but his bat, the one thing that ought to have spoken, fell silent. He went to the Ranji Trophy but saw his stump cartwheeling. It’s with this heap of criticism that he walked into the Champions Trophy to take control of his own destiny.
Over their three-week stay in Dubai, where India have played outstanding cricket en route to their third straight final appearance in a major event, if anyone has stood out with his batting on these sluggish pitches, it is Kohli. A fortnight ago, when India played Pakistan, he played an innings to savour, scoring an unbeaten 100. Last Tuesday, when India played the semi-finals against Australia, for the major part of the first innings, nearly half the stadium remained empty. But when Kohli walked in, he did so to a full house, with the busy Sheik Mohammed Bin Zayed road that connects Dubai to Abu Dhabi coming to a standstill because of the heavy traffic inflow to the Sports City.
As the late writer Peter Roebuck wrote, if Sachin Tendulkar brought a train to halt at a station for a few minutes when he was nearing a century in the 90s, these days the same can be said of Kohli, particularly in the ODIs. The format may be losing its charm elsewhere, but through Kohli it continues to remain a big draw for India.
During the World Cup on home soil in 2023, Kohli shattered records to amass 765 runs in 11 innings, the most by any player. Here in the Champions Trophy, Kohli may not be in the top-three run getters, but with 217 runs (10 short of the highest run scorer) he has been India’s go-to batsman.
The unbeaten 100 against Pakistan and 84 against Australia had just 12 boundaries to show and some of those memories could fade, but the sight of him hustling between the wickets, stealing singles at every opportunity has been a sight to behold. Speaking on the show Dressing Room, former India coach Ravi Shastri rates such innings — getting the job done in singles and twos — as a sign of Kohli in good touch.
“He is at his best. It reminds me of some of the great one-day players of the past, like (former Pakistan player) Javed Miandad. If you look at Javed’s best innings — the match-winning knocks — few boundaries, but running between the wickets, ones, twos, the energy… takes the pressure off the non-striker and never allows the scoreboard to be stagnant. It is moving all the time and that’s Kohli for you. When he is at his best, it is very few boundaries and sixes, but fantastic running between the wickets. Then you know he is in complete control and has a game plan in place,” Shastri said.
But going into the final, Kohli knows he has one incomplete job at hand. Though he has scored a match-winning knock in T20I World Cup final, such a knock of substance has been missing in his favourite format. On Sunday, against New Zealand, Kohli has an opportunity to correct that and give India another tournament to remember.

Title: Rohit has always kept others in-front and let them grow: Suryakumar Yadav

Content:
Rohit Sharma is easily the most “honest and clean hearted man” who has always let others grow, feels India’s T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav as he expressed confidence that his skipper will lead the country to ICC Champions Trophy triumph against New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday. “He is very natural and instinctive. Whatever he does he keeps others in front and watches others grow. He is an easily approachable man. He always raises his hand and say I will do this for you. He is very natural on and off the field, clean-hearted, very honest,” Surya said at the ‘India Today Conclave’.
Surya believes that a calm dug-out means a happy dressing room and hence players who are fearless and expressive.
“The camaraderie and trust which is seen on the ground among the players, most importantly the dug out is relaxed. When you see the dug out is relaxed, that means something right is happening inside,” said the T20 superstar, who has had an amazing year as full-time skipper in shortest format.
On the Champions Trophy, Surya said that he won’t look beyond India to retain the trophy. “India is winning the final tomorrow, it’s simple. India has been playing an amazing brand of cricket for the last two years and they should just be themselves,” he stated.
He said his advice to his team-mates in the T20I team is to play “fearless” and aggressive cricket.
“In a match, say two batters score 75 runs each, then two or three other batters can have 12-ball 30 like that to post a big total. We have to be fearless, either we win or we learn.”.
Asked about his relationship with head coach Gautam Gambhir, Suryakumar said, “When I was with KKR, he always spoke to me about leadership, how to carry on the field, what to do off the field, may be a better captain. I have learnt a lot from him, he is a very smart man..
Asked if Gambhir is misunderstood by people, he said, “He is a normal guy. Off the field, he does not say anything, does not utter any single word, no reaction. He is a good man.”.
Five-time champions Mumbai Indians had a below-par IPL season last year but Suryakumar reckoned that this season could be a “special year” for the franchise.

“It’s odd year (2025), emotions are high, half of boys have reached there for training. I fee it will be a special year..
Interestingly, MI won four IPL titles in odd years — 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.

Title: Shubman Gill on winning trophies: It’s not good when desperation kicks in

Content:
India will meet New Zealand in the Champions Trophy 2025 final. India has broken the 13-year-trophy drought at the 2024 World T20 Cup co-hosted by West Indies and the USA. Shubman Gill believes that winning the first trophy after so long helps on big occasions like these he says, “it’s not good when desperation kicks.”
“It gives you the momentum, also you are not very desperate about getting the title. It’s not good when desperation kicks in. Then it becomes hard to put the occasion out of the equation,” he told reporters at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on the eve of the final.
“Sometimes once you get one title, I think that kind of breaks the jinx,” he would add. “In all these big matches, the players or the teams that can put aside the pressure and take the occasion out of the game have a better chance of winning.
Gill would also mention that winning the 2024 title has not made the Indian team less hungry. “I think winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry but I think it makes us more balanced that yes we’ve won an ICC title and we’ll try to do our best to win this one.”
Former India coach Ravi Shastri said India are the firm favourites to win the 2025 Champions Trophy but New Zealand won’t give them a walkover in the final “If there’s one team that can beat India, it’s New Zealand,” Shastri said in ‘The ICC Review’.  “So India start as favourites but only just,” he said.
Shastri also highlighted Virat Kohli’s current form as a potential game-changer, while also acknowledging Williamson’s ability to seize crucial moments.

Title: WPL playoff scenarios: Can Smriti Mandhana’s RCB make it out of the league stage? What are MI and GG’s chances?

Content:
It’s the business end of the Women’s Premier League (WPL), and the qualification scenarios are getting clearer. Finalists in 2023 and 2024, Delhi Capitals have once again been the team to beat in the league stage and became the first team to seal their qualification for the playoffs. The winners of 2024, Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s chances are hanging by a thread. The top-placed team directly enters the final, while No 2 and No 3 will play in the Eliminator.
Here’s a look at team-by-team scenarios:
The most consistent franchise in the WPL, Meg Lanning’s DC are guaranteed a spot in either the Eliminator or the Final. However, they are still not guaranteed the top spot as they have finished their league play on 10 points from 8 matches. They can just wait and watch if Mumbai Indians or Gujarat Giants get to 10 points at a better run rate.
GG, a much improved side this year, have hit form at the right time. They are in a great place to reach playoffs. If they beat MI in Mumbai, they will qualify and if they manage to do it by a decent margin, can gain the top spot too. If they lose against MI, they will hope to see UPW or MI beat RCB.
Their last two matches will be played against GG and RCB at home in Mumbai. Harmanpreet Kaur and Co are just one win away from playoff spot. And two solid wins will see them potentially take over top spot from DC. If MI lose both their matches, they will hope to keep the margins low enough so that RCB can stay behind their NRR.
After starting the season on fire with the highest successful run-chase followed by another win in Vadodara, RCB had a nightmare home leg that has put them on the brink after four defeats. Defeat against UPW on Saturday will knock them out. But their fate still remains in their own hands. They face UPW and MI in their last two matches, and must win both. Given MI and GG play each other before RCB’s last match, Mandhana’s side will know the exact margin they need to beat MI in their last match to achieve a better NRR than the loser of MI vs GG.

Already knocked out of the tournament, before playing their final match of the season in Lucknow on Saturday against RCB.

Title: Shubman Gill downplays speculations on Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma futures after Champions Trophy final: ‘No talk about retirement in dressing room’

Content:
With stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma hanging up their boots from T20Is after India’s T20 World Cup triumph last year, speculations about their future in the ODI format are doing the rounds ahead of India’s Champions Trophy final against New Zealand on Sunday. Vice captain Shubman Gill, however, downplayed these talks saying that Indian dressing room is not discussing retirement of the two modern-day greats.
“There is no talk about retirement in the dressing room, now,” Gill said during the pre-match press conference ahead of New Zealand match.
Both Kohli and Rohit have guided India to an unbeaten run to the final with Kohli scoring one century along the way. Rohit, meanwhile, hasn’t had a big score this tournament but has provided India with strong starts with his aggressive batting.
The Punjab batter also talked about India’s batting depth before the all important final in Dubai.
“This is the best batting line up I am part of. Rohit is one of the best openers (in the world) and Virat, we need not tell about him. But our team has depth in batting and that allows the top order to bat with bit more freedom,” he said.

“We are all excited for the final. Last time we could not win the 50 over World Cup but we are determined to win this time. There will be big match pressure. But whichever team deals with pressure will win the final. We just need to take it like any other match, and good teams will do that. We have played four matches here and done well, so there is no added pressure on us,” he added.

Title: ‘Varun Chakarvarthy reminds me of BS Chandrasekhar’: Farokh Engineer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/varun-chakarvarthy-reminds-me-of-bs-chandrasekhar-farokh-engineer-9875865/
Content:
Varun Chakarvarthy has been bowling superbly since coming back into the Indian side. Though there have been a few questions on him getting selected in the ODI side and for the Champions Trophy the wrist spinner would answer them with his performances. His five-wicket haul against New Zealand came in a winning cause earlier in the tournament in Dubai and he bowled tidly against Australia in the semifinal.
“I think so, yeah, because my T20 series went well, probably they thought that the pitches in Dubai might be slower and I might be of some use for the team and that was the thinking behind it and yeah, it has worked this match,” Chakarvarthy would analyze the probable reason behind his selection.
“India have class spinners like Kuldeep Yadav and Varun. You know what, Varun reminds me of BS Chandrasekhar. It is wonderful that India are playing to their strengths (by using four spinners). Horses for courses depending on the pitches they are playing.” former Indian cricketer Farokh Engineer said during a felicitation ceremony
Engineer would also speak on the debate between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant. While Rahul has been a keeper through the 2023 World Cup and did well, Pant has been in and out of the white-ball side. However, coming into the Champions Trophy 2025 there was debate over if Rahul should take the gloves for the team or Pant.
Eventually, it would be Rahul who gets the nod ahead. “For India, it is a very healthy position to be in. Rahul has not done much wrong. Rishabh is very good, a batter who is a destroyer. He is just unlucky that both of them are there at the same time,” Engineer said.
“There is an argument that Rishabh can come in as an additional batter, but India have got many all-rounders. There is no room in the playing XI. It is wonderful to see Indian cricket thrive and I am proud of it,” he added.

Content:
Days after cricketer Mohammed Shami was criticised for not observing roza (fast) in the month of Ramzan during the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final match against Australia, veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar voiced his support for the bowler asking him to pay no attention to “reactionary bigoted idiots”.
Shami, who is part of the Indian squad for the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy tour, was spotted consuming an energy drink as the match was underway in Dubai on Tuesday.
After the visual of the lead pacer went viral on social media, the national president of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, said Shami had committed a sin by not fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramzan.
Akhtar, known for openly voicing his opinions, advised the cricketer to ignore all the negativity and praised his performance in the game.
“Shami saheb, don’t give a damn to those reactionary bigoted idiots who have any problem with your drinking water in a burning afternoon at a cricket field in Dubai.
“It is none of their business. You are one of the great Indian team that is making us all proud My best wishes to you and our whole team (sic)” he wrote in an X post on Friday.
India emerged victorious in Tuesday’s match, becoming the first team to qualify for Sunday’s final. The Men in Blue will fight it out with New Zealand to claim the Champions Trophy for the third time (2002 and 2013).

Content:
India after winning all the games at the 2023 World Cup lost the final of the tournament against Australia in Ahemadabad. Shubman Gill who was in good form in the tournament fell for a low score of four runs in the final. However, it was Gill’s first ICC tournament and the game against Australia was his first ICC final at senior level. The 25-year-old would recall how he had “some nerves” for the game.
“Obviously some nerves in that match (2023 final). (I learned) a lot of things. It was my first ICC Final … I was very excited. (It felt like) I was losing time to dominate in that game. I think in big ICC knockout matches, you can give yourself a little bit more time than you think,” he said speaking to ICC.
Though India lost the final they made a comeback by lifting the T20 World Cup 2024 co-hosted in the West Indies and the USA. “We lost (the World Cup Final) in ‘23 and then won in the T20 World Cup (in 2024). So I think we have got good momentum going with us in this tournament. It’s going to be a really exciting game for us and definitely, if we are able to win this one, I think it would be a great way to end this format this year,” Gill said.
India will play the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 final on Sunday against New Zealand in Dubai. “It’s a very big opportunity for us and in general, in any ICC tournament or any ICC event that happens, we have a lot of responsibility, a lot of pressure from our fans. And the last two ICC tournaments that we have played, we went on to (make the Final),” Gill would say.
India has last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013 although they reached the final in 2017 they were thumped by Pakistan in the final.

The UP Warriorz who are in the bottom place in the WPL table and staring at elimination will look to make life difficult for defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru when they face off on Saturday. RCB are in the 4th position and a loss here will most definitely end their tournament as well.

The last time these two sides met, UP had prevailed after a thrilling Super Over contest.

They are also coming on the back of 4 defeats with captain Smriti Mandhana failing to fire wth the bat.
UP, meanwhile, are mathematically alive in the league but their repeated all-round failures have pushed them towards the brink. Their batting order has misfired, especially the top 3 with chopping and changing of players which ultimately led to heir middle-order to misfire.

However, New Zealand under the astute captaincy of Mitchell Santner did keep the Indian batting in check but they were bamboozled by the mystery spin of Varun Chakarvarthy in the second innings which caused their downfall in the game.

Predicted XIs
India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy
The player to watch out for: Though all eyes will be on Varun Chakarvarthy with the ball with the bat, Rohit Sharma needs to give the side a good start. Against Bangladesh in the opening game, the Indian skipper did give a blistering start but since then his performances have taken a dip, to put the well-rounded New Zealand attack on the backfoot his quick-fire begin at the top will be vital.
New Zealand: Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (wk), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William O’Rourke.
The player to watch out for: New Zealand skipper turned the match on its head against South Africa in the semifinal and he has bowled cracking spells against the Indian side in the past. On a Dubai surface which has assisted spin so far he will be the threat against the Indian middle-order batters.

India vs New Zealand pitch report
The Dubai pitch has been conducive for the spinners so far in the tournament. The best times to bat on these wickets have been in the Powerplay when the ball is new. Once the ball got older and softer hitting has been quite a diffuclt job for the batters who walk into the middle. Batters would need sometime to get acclimatized to the pace of the conditions.

Title: Kane Williamson vs Ravindra Jadeja contest can decide the outcome of the Champions Trophy final: R Ashwin
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kane-williamson-vs-ravindra-jadeja-contest-can-decide-the-outcome-of-the-champions-trophy-final-r-ashwin-9875440/

R Ashwin has highlighted the battle between Kane Williamson and Ravindra Jadeja, which could change the course of the 2025 Champions Trophy final on Sunday. India will take on New Zealand in the much-awaited title clash at the Dubai International Stadium.
“If you are a cricket connoisseur, then Kane Williamson vs. Ravindra Jadeja is the most fascinating battle,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“While facing Jadeja, Kane Williamson moves towards leg stump because he knows Jaddu is troubling him. Sometimes he steps out and plays the chip shot over the bowler or extra cover. He even tries to play the cut shot on the back foot. It’s a cat and mouse situation. Kane Williamson wants to get on top of Jadeja. On the other hand, Jaddu too varies his length and speed.
“They are like Tom and Jerry in the middle. This contest can decide the outcome of the game. It’s a fascinating contest between Kane Williamson and Ravindra Jadeja.
“Williamson batted well against Varun and Kuldeep, yes Axar got him out, but it was Jadeja who troubled him the most.
“Jaddu is quicker than a usual left-arm spinner. It is difficult to play the cut shot against Jaddu and literally impossible to sweep him. Yes, you can play the slog sweep, but you can’t play the traditional sweep against Jadeja.
“Jaddu’s advantage over Kane Williamson is that he never bowls slow against Kane Williamson and he also gets turn. It is because of his lovely release, high release point, and the revolution he puts on the ball.
“But Kane is a clever guy. That’s why he shows all his stumps, asks Jaddu to bowl into the stumps, and he plays those chip shots over the covers. In the last game, he did the same against Jadeja,” he said.

Title: Ravi Shastri: ‘If there’s one team that can beat India, it’s New Zealand’

Former India coach Ravi Shastri said India are the firm favourites to win the 2025 Champions Trophy but New Zealand won’t give them a walkover in the final. India will take on New Zealand in the final of the 2025 Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.
“If there’s one team that can beat India, it’s New Zealand,” Shastri said in ‘The ICC Review’.
“So India start as favourites but only just,” he said.
Shastri also highlighted Virat Kohli’s current form as a potential game-changer, while also acknowledging Williamson’s ability to seize crucial moments.
“Now (on) current form, Kohli. When these guys get hot and you let them get their first 10 runs, then they’re trouble. Whether it’s Williamson, whether it’s Kohli,” Shastri said.
“So from New Zealand, I would say Williamson. To an extent, Ravindra, he is a fabulous young player.
“But these guys when they smell the coffee and you let them, in a final, get to that 10-15, then they’re doubly dangerous.” Ravindra, at just 25, has already accumulated five centuries in ICC 50-over tournaments — the youngest to achieve the feat.
“I just like the way he moves in the crease,” Shastri said.
“There’s an element of fluency, which is fabulous to see. He’s either forward, he’s back, he’ll cut, he’ll sweep it, play the quicks well, and he’s got a very good temperament.
“You don’t get hundreds in big tournaments like this just like that. You’ve got to have something up your sleeve, and I think he’s immensely talented.”
“He’s (Williamson) very stable and there’s an element of calmness, a no-nonsense element about him the way he goes about his job,” Shastri said.
“He’s like a saint, a sage, just sitting, meditating. Lot of people look at the big shots, I look at the way he moves in the crease. There’s an element of fluency.
“Joe Root when he’s batting at his best. He’s forward, back. Kohli (as well). When people move in the crease, the footwork is sound.
“It’s a joy to watch. And then with their experience, their talent, the volume of runs they’ve got, doesn’t matter what format they play,” added Shastri.

Title: Will Young on Champions Trophy final vs India: ‘It is cool to be trying to achieve the same thing 25 years late’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/will-young-on-champions-trophy-final-vs-india-it-is-cool-to-be-trying-to-achieve-the-same-thing-25-years-late-9875311/
Content:
New Zealand opener Will Young said the Mitchell Santner-led team is eager to repeat what Stephen Fleming’s side has achieved 25-years-ago. In 2000, New Zealand had defeated India by four wickets to win their first ICC title.
“There were some iconic names in that squad and those are the ones plenty of guys in this squad looked up to back in the day,” Will Young told ICC.
“It is cool to be trying to achieve the same thing 25 years later.
“I was eight years old at the time and just starting to fall in love with the game.
“I am well aware of New Zealand’s exploits in that tournament and it was fantastic to see them win.
“I’m thinking back to before we boarded the plane to come over here, we had an unveiling of the Champions Trophy squad. Scott Styris was there that day and told a few stories about the team and their exploits in that tournament.
“It was cool to recognise the past and that New Zealand has done this before. It is just about passing the baton and hopefully we can emulate them in a couple of days.”
The 32-year-old opener set the tone for New Zealand’s campaign with a ton in his side’s first game of the tournament as they beat hosts Pakistan.
India, who have played all their matches here, stormed into the final with an all-win record, and defeated Australia in the semifinal.
New Zealand, who finished second behind India in Group A after losing their league match, secured their spot in the final with a one-sided win over South Africa in the second semifinal in Lahore.
“There’s been some great battles over India in recent history including the World Test Championship and the 2023 World Cup semi-final. We’ve had some great games against India.
“But to be honest, it is who will show up on the day, you can’t be too stuck in the past.
“We’ll look to be able to adjust and adapt to whatever challenges are in front of us on Sunday and hope the game we’ve got and the nerve that we hold will be enough,” he said.

Title: Virat Kohli is able to play the way he is playing because of Shreyas Iyer: R Ashwin
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-is-able-to-play-the-way-he-is-playing-because-of-shreyas-iyer-r-ashwin-9875222/
Content:
R Ashwin has showered praise on India’s No. 4 Shreyas Iyer. The former India cricketer credited Virat Kohli’s success to Shreyas Iyer’s dominance against the spinners in the middle overs in the ongoing Champions Trophy.
Shreyas Iyer might not have scored a century or claimed the Player-of-the-Match award so far, but he is marginally behind the leading run-getter against spin in the tournament, and easily the most prolific against spin in Dubai. Iyer has managed 195 runs in four outings so far in the tournament, and Ashwin said he could be the game-changer against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final.
“For me, the game-changer will be Shreyas Iyer. It is because of his recent form,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“He was doing a post-match with Robin Uthappa. Robin asked him, how he is so composed? Then he said, ‘I have worked on my breathing technique.’ This guy has had an excellent 2023 World Cup. He has batted well against New Zealand. He has played well at the Wankhede in Mumbai. And once again, in this tournament, he has looked crackerjack,” said Ashwin.
Ashwin also lauded Iyer for working on his game against short-pitched bowling.
“He has worked well on his short-ball game as well. Of course, he got out in the last game. But it shouldn’t matter. I think this is Shreyas Iyer’s biggest strength. He wants to get better at what he is not good at,” he said.
Against Pakistan, Iyer stitched a 114-run stand for the third wicket with Virat Kohli, who remained unbeaten on 100. Against New Zealand, Shreyas walked in with India reeling at 30 for 3, then he forged a match-changing 98-run stand with Axar Patel. Shreyas scored 79. Against Australia in the semifinal, India were again in a spot of bother at 42 for 2, but Iyer put together a 91-run stand with Virat Kohli to steer India out of trouble.
“The way he plays, it helps Virat Kohli,” said Ashwin.
“There was a question with Gauti in the press conference. What was the conversation with Virat? Because he got out against a leg-spinner. Gauti gave an amazing answer. A guy has played 300 games. Obviously, he will get out. But apart from that, there is one thing: Virat Kohli is able to play the way he is playing because Shreyas Iyer is playing this way against spin.
“So, the captains are in a catch-22 situation. There will be a partnership between Shreyas and Virat. When there is a partnership between Virat and Shreyas, the captains can’t enforce a spin choke. Shreyas is removing all the pressure from Virat. So, these two in the middle overs have forged a formidable pair.
“And for Virat’s success, Shreyas Iyer has played a part in it. And for Shreyas’s success, Virat has a part in it. Because this is what people call playing in partnerships.
“Because if fast bowlers attack Shreyas Iyer, Virat Kohli can easily score runs; he can even hit the odd boundary. So, this is a combination that is made possible by Shreyas Iyer’s batting against spin. In these conditions, you can’t enforce a spin choke against India because Shreyas is batting like this. If Shreyas gets out, then it is a problem.
“But I think Shreyas Iyer will once again be a game-changer.”

Title: R Ashwin on India having advantage of playing in Dubai: ‘Tournaments are won on the basis of performances not excuses’

Content:
R Ashwin has made a scathing attack on those who have said that India are having an advantage playing in Dubai in the ongoing Champions Trophy.
“Tournaments are won on the basis of performances, not excuses,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“I am laughing when people ask our captain and coach the same question about having an advantage playing in Dubai. In the 2009 Champions Trophy, South Africa played all their games at the same venue and even then they failed to qualify for the knockouts. It was not South Africa’s fault that they didn’t qualify then. Teams qualified only because they play good cricket,” he said.
India have won all their matches in Dubai, including against the eventual finalists, New Zealand.
“India is in the final because they have played solid cricket. No matter what happens in the final, they deserved to be finalists because of the kind of cricket they have played. Please don’t throw mud at our own cricketers because of someone else’s narrative.
“I know a Test team that travels to India, loses the series, and then blames it on the pitches. Imagine an Indian cricketer coming out and saying such things if we lost a series overseas. We never do that.
“If India wins this trophy, we will be winning the title back-to-back. Let’s celebrate them. Don’t buy into this narrative.”
In the 2023 ODI World Cup, India traveled 8400 km in their league stage alone.
“In the 2023 World Cup, we played at nine different venues. I was with the team, I traveled with the team. I agree with David Miller, a one and a half hour flight does increase lactic acid in your body. But you must understand it is not in the Indian team’s hands. The ICC has made the fixtures. This schedule was decided even before an Indian became ICC chief,” he said.

Title: Mohammad Amir eyes IPL contract in 2026

Content:
Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir said he will be eligible to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2026 and if opportunity will come, he would love to explore it.
“Next year tak meri opportunity ban rahi agar hua to kyu nahi (By next year, I will have the opportunity to play in the IPL and if given the chance then why not). I will play in the IPL,” Mohammad Amir said on show “Haarna Mana Hai.”
Amir whose wife Narjis is a UK citizen and the left-arm quick is hoping to get an UK passport, which will open the doors for him to play in the IPL.
When show’s host Tabish Hashmi asked Amir, “What will be his reactions when he will be criticise in Pakistan for playing in the IPL?”
Amir, who is now retired from international cricket, without taking names said: “Pakistani cricketers were banned in the IPL, but our former cricketers were doing commentary and were also coach of the franchise.”
Amir was talking about former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, who was coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team and Ramiz Raza, who was doing commentary.
Amir said he has a lot of respect for Virat Kohli and cherishes the bat that the Indian great gave him ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup match in Kolkata in 2016. “Virat is great and admires talent,” said Amir.
“Virat gifted me his bat and I was overwhelmed by his action,” Amir reminisced. “I have always been a great admirer of his batting and he is of my bowling. I played some good knocks with his bat.”
Mohammad Amir had also revealed that he would love to play for RCB.
Ahmed Shehzad, fellow guest of the show said that Amir can change RCB’s fortunes and lead them to their maiden IPL title.
“RCB need a bowler like Amir to fix their bowling woes. They have good batting unit but their problem has always been a problem. If Amir plays for RCB, they will win the title,” he said.

Title: Rohit & Co’s toughest challenge: How to hate the nice guys from New Zealand
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-cos-toughest-challenge-how-to-hate-the-nice-guys-from-new-zealand-9874981/
Content:
“You know what the biggest problem is when you play New Zealand?”
This was a shattered senior India player asking a rhetorical question to a friend just a few hours after suffering that unprecedented 3-0 Test series whitewash at home late last year.
“It is tough to hate them, be angry at them. Imagine, this was their historic win but the celebrations were so mild. No shouting or sledging, no fuss. They shook hands with us and just moved to their dressing room. Had it been Australia or England …”, the frustrated voice would trail and fade.
If killing with kindness was an art, the congenial cricketers from the earth’s extreme outpost have mastered it. Of late, India has gotten defanged by these silent, disarming, almost self-deprecating, opponents at important events – most painfully the ICC World Test Championship final in 2021 and the 50-over World Cup semi-final in 2019.
On Sunday, they meet again in the ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai. As conceded by the dejected India player, India would hope to get angry. Not that easy, as they need to hate a team that doesn’t instigate or insult. India needs to search for the devil in mild-mannered soft-spoken men with angelic faces. And anyone who vaguely knows the modest-to-a-fault captain Mitchell Santner or the equally self-effacing senior pro Kane Williamson will tell you it is tough to paint them as villains.
Not just the two, the Kiwis, in general, are among the most popular cricketers on the IPL circuit too – the truly global annual T20 jamboree. Owners find them the least problematic and most accommodative. Their teammates say they are the most giving.
It has taken New Zealand years to build this ‘nice guys’ reputation and for that, they need to thank the fine ambassadors that have visited these shores over the years.
Richard Hadlee was a friend and mentor to Kapil Dev, it didn’t matter if the two were involved in the race to be the highest Test wicket-taker. New Zealand’s most gifted batsman ever, Martin Crowe would talk fondly about the time he spent and the tips he got from batting legend Sunil Gavaskar during his county days.
However, it was at the start of this century when India got a chance to know a New Zealander much better. It so happened that a farmer’s son, an international cricketer with a modest record, was made India’s first-ever national coach. He was John Wright. This was the time when Indian cricket was limping back to normalcy after the body blow of the match-fixing scandal.
Wright was a simple man with a sharp mind. He too had that typical Kiwi disarming ‘bechara look’ that Santner and Williamson have. He was unlike the other ‘white men’ India had dealt with – the English and Australians.
He was firm but not authoritative. He didn’t behave like a superior being, didn’t consider himself as god’s gift air-dropped to the Third World for educating the natives. India’s archaic system did frustrate him but he was ready to work around it. Wright introduced India to modern cricket and made Sourav Ganguly’s boys world-beaters, but you would never hear that from him.
Wright’s integration into the Indian system was like that old story about the arrival of the Parsis. Like sugar in milk, Wright remained invisible but spread sweetness. In contrast, Aussie coach Greg Chappell’s Indian sojourn was like chocolate mixed with milk. It changed the colour of the team and left a bitter-sweet taste.
Wright would return as the Mumbai Indians talent scout and would do the country another massive favour. He mined a raw diamond, Jasprit Bumrah, who would get polished into a kohinoor.
Another silent cricketing Dronacharya would make Chennai Super Kings his home. Stephen Fleming, too, had the same ‘bechara’ disarming look. He too was a cool calculating feline, a predator in sheep’s clothing. Fleming continues to be MS Dhoni’s robust sounding board.
Like Wright didn’t mind Sourav Ganguly getting all the credit for the team’s success, Fleming is happy to be consigliere to the Godfather, the Thala.
It is their consistent civility that makes the Kiwis endearing. It’s what has made India sub-consciously develop a fondness for the cricketers from the peaceful paradise at the corner of the earth.
One cricket tour to New Zealand is enough to get introduced to the friendly community that, as a habit, downplays its achievements. The most famous Kiwi, Edmund Hillary, climbed Mt Everest but never failed to give credit to his sherpa, Tenzing Norgay. This gets reflected in everyday life. Even the famous New Zealand woollens come with a Ba-code – scan it to get a picture of the sheep responsible for the warmth you are getting. No one steals anybody’s thunder. Everyone’s effort gets acknowledged.
There is a distinct air of casualness on the streets where kids are encouraged to walk bare feet. Christchurch comes across as a quaint make-believe world. Kids playing frisbee in soft sunlight on neatly manicured lawns; a well-fed dog jumping around as his owner reads a book on an easy chair, old couples sitting in street-side cafes waving to tourists in flower-decked trams.
The world looks at the tiny Pacific island as a utopia. “Let’s move to New Zealand” – is now a pet phrase for those disgusted with their own country and looking for new beginnings. Reports say that when Donald Trump came to power, enquiries in the USA about migration to New Zealand in America went up by 2000 percent.
New Zealand’s appeal is its friendly people. It’s a chatty place where strangers indulge in small talk for hours. A plumber fixing a leaking tap at the prime minister’s residence can get asked to stay back for a cup of tea.
On the 2009 tour to New Zealand, one lazy afternoon, the team manager explained the Kiwi knack to innovation and being hands on. He said that when you have so few people and such large swathes of farmland, there will be isolation and thus innovation. For them, DIY isn’t a superstore but a way of life.
The manager went on to narrate his dressing room’s work distribution. Batsman Grant Elliott kept the dressing room litter-free, pacer Ian Butler was the team’s transport in-charge, Martin Guptill was given the duty of taking care of the national flag. Everyone had a non-cricketing responsibility. It was this upbringing that kept the cricketers grounded. Thankfully, the IPL riches have failed to corrupt the Kiwi DNA.
In this social media-obsessed world where once-scoffed human traits of self-promotion and bragging are getting increasingly legitimised, the Kiwis still stick to old human values. Rohit Sharma and his boys have their task cut out. There is so much to like about the Kiwis that it gets impossible to hate them.

Title: Two days before the Champions Trophy final, what’s the mood in the finalists’ camp
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/before-champions-trophy-final-whats-mood-in-finalists-camp-9874685/
Content:
Rawalpindi to Dubai. Dubai to Lahore. Lahore to Dubai. This has been New Zealand’s itinerary over the past week and having endured more travel than any other team in the Champions Trophy, the Black Caps chose to give their players a much needed rest on Friday ahead of their final against India this Sunday.
While most teams opt for optional or light training on the eve of the match these days, New Zealand have chosen to train under lights on Saturday with India scheduled to practice from 3 PM. While there have been a lot of criticisms directed at the ICC for making the schedule to the comfort of India, the New Zealand coach echoed similar sentiments even though his players downplayed the whole episode.
However, he did voice his concern about the hectic schedule. Apart from India who got to play all their matches, because of the inclement weather in Pakistan, most teams ended with just two matches. England, which lost all three, were the exception alongside New Zealand.
“There’s no doubt that coming here after Lahore – we had a full day of travel yesterday – takes it out of you a little bit. But we’ve got a couple of days now, a little bit of recovery and a little bit of planning and training towards the game. But I guess we’re deep into the tournament now and sometimes it’s not always a lot of training that you need. It’s just getting your body and your mind right to compete in the final. That will be our key focus over the next two days,” Stead said on Friday.
The juggle between Dubai and Pakistan means, New Zealand have to once again get acclimated to the conditions over here as quickly as possible. In flat decks of Pakistan, New Zealand have outplayed everyone, but in the slow conditions of Dubai their batsmen struggled to replicate the same touch. “I think that’s just about adapting and working out on your feet what you think that par score is for the day. I think the danger is you come from scoring 360-odd in a game and you think you’ll do that again immediately and you go a little bit too hard. So, for us, it’s just working out what are the right tactics on the day, who we are faced up against as well, and then adapting to that,” Stead said.
Coming into the final, New Zealand are already sweating over the availability of their premier pacer Matt Henry who hurt his shoulders while taking a catch to dismiss Rassie van der Dussen in the semi-finals. While he did return to the field and even bowl, Stead said Henry’s availability is not known at this stage.
“We’ve had some scans and stuff done on him, and we’re going to give him every chance to be playing in this match. Still a little bit unknown at this stage,” Stead said about Henry, who is leading the tournament’s wicket charts with 10 wickets at an average of 16.70.
Against India in the group game, Henry ended up with five wickets and has proved to be a headache for them in the past with his movement and pace. “He’s obviously pretty sore just from landing on the point of his shoulder. Hopefully he will be okay,” Stead said.
India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak stressed that having encountered all sorts of situations and come out on top, they are very well prepared for Sunday’s final. In the four matches, against as many opponents, India have been tested at different levels, including when batting first against New Zealand and chasing a tricky total against Australia.
“The wicket changes a little, obviously, but overall, the tendency of the wicket has not changed much. But the batting has been very good. Secondly, in four matches, batting first or second we got runs from openers and when they didn’t the middle-order gave some runs. Till now, there was not much need for power hitting and in the last match it also happened,” Kotak said.
After playing a turner against New Zealand, the pitch for the Australia game was the most batting friendly of the lot. While all four matches have been played on fresh surfaces, the final will be played on the centre pitch which was used for the match against Pakistan. Kotak said irrespective of the pitch, India’s batting group has the game to adjust to any condition.
“Our batters, to be very honest, can adjust on any surface. The planning, when you see the wickets like this, we take it stage by stage. In the powerplay, Rohit has his own plan, Shubman plays with his own plan. And they are playing to the team’s plan. And obviously if it is a 350 wicket, guys go a little harder. On this kind of a wicket, you try and rotate strike well, you try to take the game deep, and then try and finish the game if you are chasing or try to set the bigger possible target. So I think we have done that pretty well,” Kotak added.

Title: The incredible Varun Chakravarthy story: Movie cameo, architect, shy debutant, now Rohit Sharma’s trump card
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/varun-chakravarthy-story-movie-cameo-architect-india-trump-card-9874617/
Content:
Varun Chakravarthy played a cameo in the 2014 Tamil movie ‘Jeeva’, starring Vishnu Vishal in the lead role. Little Varun would have known then that he was playing a cameo in a movie almost resembling the story of his life. The movie revolves around a talented cricketer, who with his modest means struggles to keep his dream alive while fighting the system. The protagonist is seen as an outlier, an unwelcome guest in a local club until he wins the dressing room with his talent. Even as he climbs the ladder that outlier tag hangs around him, nearly pushing him to quit cricket before a phone call from an IPL scout changes his life for good. The movie ends with the Jeeva earning an India cap.
Like the titular character in Jeeva, Varun is an outlier in every sense. He is a throwback to the decades gone by, when Indian spinners were expected only to bowl. He isn’t a product of India’s fairly robust cricketing system. He didn’t feature in any age-group tournaments that took him to the Ranji Trophy, to then be brought into the national fold. Instead, his career began with tennis ball, then TNPL, fast-tracked to IPL and now it has taken him to the Indian dressing room. Now, playing his second ICC event – his first in four years – at the Champions Trophy, Varun is Rohit Sharma’s trump card. Despite having three quality spinners in Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, Varun’s mystery element compelled his inclusion, first in the squad, and then in the XI.
In 2021, despite having become a household name on the back of performances in the IPL, when he was picked in T20 World Cup which included familiar faces, it still felt overwhelming for Varun. He had gotten acquainted with most Indian players during the IPL, but in the dressing room, it felt different as he would keep mostly to himself. Former India bowling coach Bharat Arun recalls Varun’s India T20 debut. “He definitely looked a bit overawed. He was scared of even telling Virat Kohli what field setting he wanted. He ended up bowling to the field given to him,” Arun, who coaches him at the Kolkata Knight Riders, tells The Indian Express.
“But look at him now. He is a totally different cricketer. We say cricket at the elite level is 90% mental and Varun stands true for it. He went back to domestic cricket and IPL, got wickets and that is showing in his confidence. He now knows what to do when given the ball. He is setting his own field, because he believes in himself more.”
As Varun admitted recently on a YouTube channel Fries With Potate, he did feel out of place in those years. “Obviously, when I was 26, I didn’t have a history of hitting the gym because I was in a 9-5 job earlier. Then I directly got into a cricket team and first three years I kept failing the fitness tests. If someone says, ‘You have a yo-yo test slotted for tomorrow’, I never used to get sleep. Have got panic attacks. People who don’t know the process will panic more. Of course, even now I have anxiety and pressure, but I know how to handle them.”
***
Varun’s journey is similar to that of Jack Iverson, who played five Tests for Australia in 1950 and 1951. A jackaroo in the mallees of Victoria, he participated in World War II in the Middle East before moving to Papua New Guinea where he learned to spin the ball by gripping it between his thumb and middle finger. Having first played club cricket for Melbourne CC in 1948, he would play Test cricket in 1951. Varun’s arc too is similarly impromptu. The changeover from an architect in 2016 to a mystery spinner in 2018 who got the IPL cap in 2019 happened in just three years.
For someone who wants to make suspense-thriller movies once he finishes his cricketing career, a rewind of his career would provide him with all the unpredictable twists.
Before he became a professional cricketer in 2017, for a year Varun played local tournaments because, “those were matches when somebody was batting, a random person would come and say if you hit a six, you will get Rs 500. If you hit a boundary Rs 300. It was giving me money,” he would recall. If not that, he would go searching for opportunities to bowl in the nets to league-level players. At one stage, he was a net bowler to former India opener Kris Srikkanth’s son Anirudha in the nets, who used to pay him Rs 500 for a session.
With offers opening up in lower-division cricket, he would get a reality check when he knocked on the doors of the academies. “I was the odd one out because at every academy you will find only players below 20 years of age. I used to tell them, don’t teach me anything, just allow me to bowl for three hours. Because at that stage you can’t teach someone to how to play cricket so every day I would bowl 300 deliveries to prepare for the league cricket,” he says.
When an opportunity opened up in the second division, the team would stop pacer Varun from becoming a mystery spinner. “They didn’t take me, so I went to the fifth division (lowest in TNCA back then). Even there I started as a pacer and had just 8 wickets to show in 7 matches. But in the next game, in the middle of the game, I just ran in and started bowling spin and ended up with 28 wickets in 4 matches. And I was in the newspapers now,” Varun adds.
Starting to bowl mystery spin wasn’t a straightforward choice. In the time he spent recovering from a knee injury when he was still a pacer, Varun would sit and watch videos of Anil Kumble, Rashid Khan and Adam Zampa. By his own admission at one point, he had up to 18 variations before he cut them down to 4 sans any personal coaching.
While the mystery spin would land him a TNPL contract in 2017, what is little known to the world is he was picked as an opening batsman by Karaikudi Kalais. “I played only one match, but nobody gives me batting Sir,” he would rue to Srikkanth once. “After Impact Player rule came in, I don’t even get an opportunity. They just see me as a bowler. Hopefully I will have a chance soon.”
However, by next season with word spreading about the mystery element, Madurai Panthers picked him at the TNPL auction. By 2019, he was wearing Punjab Kings colours in the IPL, but as luck would have, just played one match. “Since I was over-excited, I didn’t handle myself well. I was struggling with shoulder pain, but kept bowling and ended up tearing my muscle. I’d no clue back then.”
Along the way, Varun had to deal with trolls. In 2022, when he picked up just 6 wickets in 11 IPL matches, he recalls getting a lot of taunts. “There have been matches where if I don’t bowl well and get hit, they used to tell me ‘I’m not mystery but maesthri (construction worker in Tamil)’ because I’m an architect. They have told I’m fit only for that. All of these messages used to be from Dream XI fans who used to put money on me performing.”
***
Varun’s move to KKR ahead of the 2020 season would be a game-changer. With Dinesh Karthik around, he had a familiar face as a mentor. More importantly, he also had Sunil Narine, mystery spinner extraordinaire. Though their styles are not similar – Narine is an off-spinner who bowls the one that goes away, Varun is a leg-spinner who bowls googlies – he would become the Trinidadian’s understudy before standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in the last two seasons.
“They are different bowlers, but they discuss a lot,” Arun says. “In the last two years, he has understood his bowling very well and knows when to use the variations. There are just three, but he is able to create illusions in the minds of the batsmen. More than the ones that spin, it is those deliveries that straighten that are getting him wickets,” he adds.
Over the past 12 months, Varun may have hardly got time to think about anything beyond his cricket. But when he wants to switch off from cricket, he goes back to architecture. Apart from being a good distraction, it has also helped him with his game. “When I look at an empty space of land, I visualise a building. Similarly, when a batsman is there, I get to visualise what is going to do with his stance and grip,” he says.
One cannot be sure where Varun’s career goes from here. Once he hangs up his boots, which is not anywhere close, one can expect him to pursue filmmaking. Word is that he has three bounded scripts, with screenplay and dialogues completed. As he revealed to R Ashwin, he is certain that if actor Vijay (who has quit acting after entering politics) listens to his story, he would commit to it. “I want to see the world through my lenses,” he says.
Few would bet against it.

Champions Trophy 2025 hosted by Pakistan came after 29 years amidst security concerns over the country. Pakistan’s leg of the tournament concluded with the semifinal between South Africa and New Zealand in Lahore. The ICC Safety and Security Manager Dave Musker praised the arrangements and professionalism of the security during the tournament.
“Just wanted to do a short video to thank all the Pakistani police. Police and the Army have been absolutely superb. Prior to the tournament, there were concerns by visiting teams over coming to Pakistan. I personally had no doubts, the professionalism of the people I have been involved with is exceptional. The cooperation and the respect I have been shown is amazing,”Musker said.
The country has organized comprehensive security team for the tournament and Punjab Police will take care of the security in Lahore and Rawalpindi. As reported by Pakistani news outlet Geo TV, over 12,000 officers and personnel were deployed to ensure the security during the matches.
A total of 18 senior officers, 54 DSPs, 135 inspectors, and 1,200 upper subordinates were on duty, while 10,556 constables and over 200 female police officers were also assigned security and checking duties.
Apart from the security measures, Pakistan’s national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) had announced special charter flights for the fans.
There were nine special charter flights that were operated between Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore during the event for the smooth transportation of both fans and teams. PIA also showcase the culture of Pakistan during these flights.

Title: I saw some comments from Sunil Gavaskar about the Indian B team or the Indian C team beating Pakistan’s top team… Absolute nonsense: Jason Gillespie
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-saw-some-comments-from-sunil-gavaskar-about-the-indian-b-team-or-the-indian-c-team-beating-pakistans-top-team-thats-nonsense-absolute-nonsense-jason-gillespie-9874220/
Content:
Former Pakistan coach Jason Gillespie slammed Sunil Gavaskar about his comments on Indian B team giving a tough run to Pakistan side in their current state. The Men in Green have been knocked out of the Champions Trophy 2025 without reaching the semifinals and they had a similarly poor run in 2024 T20 World Cup when they got knocked out in the group stage.
“I don’t buy this rhetoric. I saw some comments from Sunil Gavaskar about the Indian B team or the Indian C team beating Pakistan’s top team. That’s nonsense. Absolute nonsense. If Pakistan picks and stick with the right players and gives them time to shine, time to learn, and develop their games, they can beat anyone. I have got no doubt about that,” Gillespie would say.
“If the PCB, as a board, wants to change and get the right results, they need to get the right people, the right selection panel, and give players time to flourish and do their job. If you are hiring a new coach, give him the opportunity to do something meaningful, give him the time. Otherwise, the results are going to be the same,” he added.
Since winning the last edition of the Champions Trophy, apart from the T20 World Cups, where they reached one semi-final and a final in 2021 and 2022, their cricketing curve has been descending in ODIs and Tests. Since the World Test Championship came into effect, in three cycles their standing reads thus: 5th, 7th, 9th (bottom placed). In the 2019 and 2023 World Cup, they finished fifth, failing to even reach the semi-finals. And now in a 8-team Champions Trophy they have failed to get past the group stages.
Having gone about investing heavily on infrastructure for hosting the Champions Trophy, it appears Pakistan were never really ready for the tournament. Compared to their glory years, this is a team that is bereft of talent. Though they have historically relied on their pace pack, at different eras have had at least a couple of batsmen who were on par with the rest of the world, if not better.

Title: Champions Trophy: ‘I took the liberty of asking Virat Kohli to hit me a six but he never…’: Pakistan leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed opens up on his duel against Kohli
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-i-took-the-liberty-of-asking-virat-kohli-to-hit-me-a-six-but-he-never-pakistan-leg-spinner-abrar-ahmed-opens-up-on-his-duel-against-virat-kohli-9874280/
Content:
Pakistani leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed may have failed to take the wicket of Virat Kohli in the country’s opening match against arch rivals India in the Champions Trophy last month, but the 26-year-old bowled a major of his spell against Kohli in the match. While Ahmed picked up the wicket of Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill and received some flak for his celebrations, Kohli went on to hit a hundred in the match. Ahmed now has recalled his experience of bowling against Kohli and shared that Kohli told him ‘well bowled after the match.
“My childhood dream of bowling to Kohli has come true in Dubai. It was a great challenge and I took the liberty of teasing him, asking him to hit me a six but he never got angry. Kohli is a great batter, we all know that. But he is a great human being too. He said, ‘well bowled’ after the match, and that made my day,” Ahmed told Telecom Asia Sport.
The Pakistani spinner was playing in his tenth ODI and the group match against India was the first time that he was playing in a match against the arch rivals. The leg-spinner, who has 15 wickets in his ODI career so far, had bowled 30 balls during his ten overs in the match. Kohli, who played a knock of 100 runs off 111 balls to star in India’s win, managed to score 16 runs in those 30 balls. Ahmed showered praise on Kohli’s fitness. “I have grown up idolizing Kohli and used to tell Under-19 players that one day I will bowl to him. Kohli’s fitness is outstanding. The way he runs between the wicket is eye-catching and that’s what makes him a unique cricketer,” added Ahmed.
During India’s chase, Ahmed had gotten rid of Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill with a googly and gave the Indian vice-captain a send-off. India were placed 100 for 2 in 17.3 overs when Gill was dismissed. Ahmed downplayed the incident. “That’s my style and I see nothing wrong with it. No official told me that I did anything wrong but if it hurt anyone, I am sorry for that. It was not my intention to hurt anyone,” said Ahmed.
Earlier, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram had criticised Ahmed over his celebrations. “I was very impressed with the ball, I wasn’t impressed with the celebrations. Time aur jagah hoti hain na yaar (There is time and place for it, buddy). If you are winning, celebrate. When you know, the team is stuck, you get the wicket, be humble. Be Humble. But that’s not happening. There is no one to tell him that,” Akram had told The Pavillion on Ten Sports.

Title: India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy final: ‘New Zealand may lose but if..’ Nasser Hussain’s warning to Rohit Sharma led Indian team
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-champions-trophy-final-new-zealand-may-lose-but-if-nasser-hussains-warning-to-rohit-sharma-led-indian-team-9874224/
Content:
With India and New Zealand having met twice in the ICC tournaments finals with both occasions seeing New Zealand winning the title in the past, the Mitchell Santner led New Zealand side will be eying their third win in an ICC tournament final over India in the Champions Trophy final at Dubai on Sunday. New Zealand won the 2000 Champions Trophy apart from winning the ICC Test Championship in 2021 to keep their record to two wins in two ICC finals. Former England captain Nasser Hussain has backed a tough New Zealand to be capable of winning against India on Sunday.
“They also have that great mixture between senior pros that have been there year in, year out – like Kane Williamson, one of the all-time greats – and youth in the likes of Rachin Ravindra. They may well lose (New Zealand), but if they do, it will be because India beat them,” said Hussain while speaking with Sky Sports Cricket.
In recent years, both New Zealand and India have won a match each in the knockout stages of ICC tournaments with New Zealand winning the 2019 World Cup semi-final and India winning the 2023 World Cup semi-final. While New Zealand suffered a 44-run loss against India in the group match earlier in the tournament, the Mitchell Santner led side scored a 50- run win over South Africa in the semi-finals to set up the summit clash against India. Hussain recalled his conversation with former Australia captain Aaron Finch to talk about the island nation’s chances in the final. “They will not bottle it, they won’t choke. We were having dinner with Aaron Finch and he summed it up pretty well in saying New Zealand are never a side that beat themselves. And by that, he means that they will rock up and they will put in a performance,” added Hussain.
New Zealand have reached the semi-final or finals in the last three ODI World Cups with final appearances in the 2015 and 2019 World Cup and a semi-final appearance in the 2023 World Cup. Hussain touched upon the team’s ability to constantly reach the knockout stages in ICC tournaments. “All the way through the New Zealand lineup they have some very, very tough cricketers who turn up to every single game and give it their absolute best – that’s why they will always be there around semi-finals and finals.” said Hussain.

Title: The Sam Konstas post-script: Why Australians can’t make sense of the batting ‘wunderkid’, with each passing Sheffield Shield game
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/the-sam-konstas-post-script-why-australians-cant-make-sense-of-the-batting-wunderkid-with-each-passing-sheffield-shield-game-9874169/
Content:
While Sam Konstas was absolute box office during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, his outings in Sheffield Shield post that have left Aussie greats boggled about what to make of the batting wunderkid who ramped Jasprit Bumrah even.
His most recent failure with the bat during New South Wales’ Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia in Perth, drew a plethora of scrutiny and reactions. The 19-year-old opener was claimed by seamer Joel Paris during the evening session of day one after mistiming a lofted drive towards mid-off, trudging off for 6, reported Fox Cricket.
Ignored for the Sri Lanka tour, Konstas has hit a barren run – struggling to get a first-class 50 since his unforgettable Test debut at the MCG on Boxing Day. His subsequent scores read 6, 17, 10, 22, 3, 22, 23 and 8, even as he has one match left to get into contention for June’s World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord’s.
His high-risk, high-reward style, and bearing on the field, however have split opinion.
Victorian coach Chris Rogers, was quoted by Fox Last month saying he didn’t think Konstas himself was keen on playing the combative style. “It’s interesting because I know a couple of the boys who have been around him said he doesn’t particularly want to play like that. I wonder if it’s just he gets into the contest and his heart rate goes up and he makes these decisions a little bit on the fly. I really don’t know,” Rogers wondered.
While Pat Cummins had endorsed Konstas’ batting bravado in February, saying he’d rather that players err on the aggressive and overconfident side rather than sitting back and letting the game dictate them, older legends are scratching their heads.
Australian legend Allan Border believed his Bazball-adjacent approach isn’t sustainable, as per Fox.
“He’s 19, so he’s got that youthful exuberance. I don’t want to take that away from him. But can you play that way consistently, constantly? We’re seeing the future. Blokes don’t want to just play conservatively, they want to attack the bowling. Is it the right way? There’s room for it, maybe not for everyone. But for him, if he wants to play that way, (he needs to) get some consistency about his scoring. It’s no good getting 25 with ramps and the rest of it. It doesn’t help the side at all,” he was quoted by Fox Cricket.
Fox wrote that former Australian captain Steve Waugh had ‘questioned whether Konstas was suffering from dissociative identity disorder following his Boxing Day bash.’
“I just hope (his debut) hasn’t messed with his head. He is only 19. I look back to when I was 19 and I didn’t know what I was doing really,” Waugh told SEN last week, as per Fox.  “He has taken on a big risk the way he has played and he has almost probably suffered for it already, dropped after a couple of Test matches and didn’t play against Sri Lanka. (He then) goes back to Shield cricket and doesn’t really know what he is doing. I saw the match against Victoria where the first over of a Shield game he tried ramping shots, reverse sweep and charging Scott Boland who is one of the best bowlers in the world. You’ve got to have more respect for the game, the game will bite you pretty quickly if you don’t respect it.
“I’d like to see him play a traditional innings in the next couple of matches and get his head right and get him back in the zone.
“I’ve seen him play grade cricket for Sutherland and he is technically very correct and plays traditionally. He has to get back to that because if he keeps playing the way he is, he is not going to be successful,” Waugh urged.
Border’s other concern had been Konstas risking provoking the opposition and fuelling the fire if he didn’t rein in his behaviour, as per Fox.
“There’s a cockiness about the way he plays. I’m all for confidence and letting him do his thing … but that cockiness you’ve got to try and take out of the equation. I would have had a word by now, just to say, ‘Mate, as you’re finding out, it’s a slightly different ball game to Under 19s.’
“You want to be confident about your abilities … but that doesn’t mean just saying ridiculous things out in the field, just for the sake of chirping someone.
“You’ve got to earn your stripes. Him chirping them, I would feel really aggrieved by that; a 19-year-old brat having a crack. They’ll want to bring this guy back down to earth pretty quick.
“This game has a habit of biting you on the ass, so just calm the farm a little bit,” he was quoted by Fox.

Title: They are very big former players…requested to keep the choice of their words right: Babar Azam’s father slams his critics

Content:
Babar Azam has come under immense criticism for Pakistan’s recent performance in the Champions Trophy 2025. His knock against New Zealand in the tournament’s opener was lambasted by the former players because of Babar’s strike rate in a mammoth run chase, and amid the criticism Babar has been dropped from the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand.
Babar’s father, Azam Siddique took to Instagram to express his views. He would recall Babar was the member of the ICC T20 team of the year, “Member of ICC’s Twenty20 of the year team, and even after getting the cap, he dropped. It is okay. He will perform in National T20 and in PSL. Insha Allah, he will come back soon after performing in the team,” he said.
Siddique would also vent out his frustration on former Pakistan players. “They are very big former players. They are requested to keep the choice of their words right. If someone answers back, they may not be able to bear it. You are the past,” he would add.

A post shared by Muhammad Azam (@azamsiddique59)
In addition to Babar, Siddique himself too was criticized for backing his son. “Some others say that the father speaks more, so his first and last is in the Holy Prophet. Coach, spokesperson, mentor, and the best wisher and father in the world. Those who don’t have or are not capable of it should be patient and it is a request to cricket lovers who have been shouting day and night before listening to them,” he would say.

Title: ‘We’ll be putting our thinking caps on around how we nullify’: Gary Stead on New Zealand facing Varun Chakarvarthy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/well-be-putting-our-thinking-caps-on-around-how-we-nullify-gary-stead-on-new-zealand-facing-varun-chakarvarthy-9873998/
Content:
Wrist spinner Varun Chakarvarthy troubled the Kiwi batter on Sunday during the final group game of the Champions Trophy 2025. He ended up with a five-wicket haul, which helped India thrash New Zealand by 44 runs. The leg-spinner, since making his comeback into the India colours, has been a thorn in the flesh of the batters with his willy variations and deadly accuracy.
The Kiwi batters who did not have an answer to his tricks might have to face him in the final of the competition on Sunday yet again. New Zealand Head Coach Gary Stead would acknowledge that Chakarvarthy is a threat and the Blackcaps need to put on thinking caps to deal with him.
“We expect him to play after getting 5/42 against us in the last game. He’s a class bowler and showed his skills against us last time and he’s a big threat in the game,” Stead told reporters on Friday. “So we’ll be putting our thinking caps on around how we nullify that and how we can still score runs against him,” he added.
The scheduling for the tournament has sparked debate after South African player David Miller’s comments on travel when both South Africa and Australia had to travel to Dubai and wait to see who would face India and the other hand to travel back to Lahore for the second semifinal to face New Zealand.
“It’s only an hour and 40-minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,” Miller said speaking to ESPNcricinfo. “It’s early morning, it’s after a game, and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7:30 am, we had to come back. It doesn’t make it nice,” he added.
Stead admitted it was a bit hectic but said his side was good enough to adjust to such schedules.
“There’s no doubt that coming here off playing Lahore and we had a full day of travel yesterday, then it just takes it out of you a little bit, but we’ve got a couple of days now of a little bit of recovery and planning and training towards the game,” he would add.

Title: Mitchell Santner – ‘We ask bowlers to be aggressive always; taking wickets in middle overs hardest thing in one-day cricket’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mitchell-santner-we-ask-bowlers-to-be-aggressive-always-taking-wickets-in-middle-overs-hardest-thing-in-one-day-cricket-9873982/
Content:
Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson, the centurion batters, obviously were key to New Zealand defeating South Africa in the Champions Trophy semifinals. But captain Mitchell Santner reckoned it was the pressure exerted by the Kiwi bowlers like Glenn Phillips and Rachin in the middle overs, chipping away with wickets that’s the key to the Black Caps success.
Speaking to Cric-Mate Voice after landing in Dubai on Thursday to take on India in the finals on Sunday, Santner said they employed the run-strangulation in the middle overs that broke South Africa. “It was a used wicket but we thought it might break up or spin a little bit more than it did. But it held together and still was a pretty good track. Was just trying to fire on good length and pitch perfectly. One spun, which was nice,” he offered of his own tactics against Rassie van der Dussen and  Heinrich Klaasen.
The middle overs are key when New Zealand operate. “Partnerships were still there but we did a great job at the other end. When you throw the ball to GP (Glenn Phillips) and Chin (Rachin), there was kinda key wickets, to keep pressure on South Africa and chip away. We asked all bowlers to be aggressive. Even fast bowlers, short balls. Stuff like that. Keep being aggressive with the ball,” Santner explained adding how the invisible noose tightens in overs 11 to 40. “Trying to take wickets in the middle overs. That’s the toughest thing in one day cricket. If you can’t do that, teams get 500!” Santner said.
New Zealand have reached three ICC 50 over finals, losing two World Cups, one on boundary count, but they can be counted upon to never whinge and just go for it. “Finals cricket is different (for Rachin, O’Rourke),” Santner told Cric-Mate when asked about the first timers on Finals Sunday. “For us, whatever we’ve been doing to get to this point is good. We showed a lot of good stuff. The way we operate as a unit. Obviously we come up against a good side, who’ve played all their games in Dubai, know their surface. We’ll be better for the run we had against them the other day. It’s about keeping up with recent form. It’s just another game. It’s obviously not. But how you go about it, it’s just another game. Things we’ve been doing, we don’t need to change too much. The surface will dictate a little bit about how we operate. Might be a little slower than what we got in Lahore. But if it’s gonna be a scrap, we’ve done scrap,” he added.
He waved aside concerns of having to travel to and from Pakistan. “Travel is all part of the challenge – Dubai and Pakistan. The guys understand it’s a part of the game these days. As long as you are ready to go, the triseries before the event was handy to get guys in form. This tournament is quite short. Three games and you’re in semis. So we had a bit of a roll on. And hopefully we get there,” he told Cric-Mate Voice.
Ferrying and unloading their own baggage from the conveyor belt at the airport, the team posed for pictures with Indian fans, as was visible in the video.
He was impressed with his batting unit though, adding the whole unit had fired at different times, setting up a good final. “Kane and Rachin were special to watch. Both go about it differently. Kane just does his thing. I thought he played an extremely great knock. Together they made 6 runs an over look extremely easy. And then getting the ramps and scoops. The way they took down Maharaj who was a big threat in their side for sure. Rachin just played with freedom. That’s pretty cool to watch. Made our job as bowlers easy,” Santner told Cric-Mate.
“SA bowled well at the start. (We) Kinda weathered the storm. Young, Kane and Rachin. From there they just showed great teeth throughout innings and took down the balls they thought they could. Soaked up some tough spells and then increased their run rate from 30th. From there they took us from 320 to 360 which was probably slightly above par,” he said.
Fielding to back up the bowlers was crucial. “A team like South Africa with the power they’ve got in their line up, we knew we weren’t safe. Knew we had to keep going well. Even 1 for 50 was still good in powerplay on that wicket and our spinners were able to tie them up a little bit. Keep chipping wickets away and back up in the field so great all round team performance. Different guys stepped up and firing at different times throughout the tournament,” he added.

Title: ‘If Kane Williamson hadn’t been slightly unfit… Ravindra might not have gotten his chance’: Tim Southee
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/if-kane-williamson-hadnt-been-slightly-unfit-ravindra-might-not-have-gotten-his-chance-tim-southee-9873870/
Content:
In the opening game of the 2023 World Cup when New Zealand played England in Ahemadabad Rachin Ravindra blitzed with 96-balls 123 runs. Post the match-winning innings Ravindra got a continued run in the New Zealand team and now has become a regular in the side. Former New Zealand cricketer Tim Southee would recall if Kane Williamson had not been injured Rachin would not have got his opportunity.
“He’s still young, but he has a mature mindset. If Kane Williamson hadn’t been slightly unfit due to his knee injury during the One-Day World Cup last year, Ravindra might not have gotten his chance. But everything happens for a reason. He is always eager to learn, constantly seeking advice from experienced players like Williamson. For a young player, his willingness to improve stands out,” Southee said speaking on ESPNcricinfo.
Rachin smashed his fifth ICC ton in the game against South Africa to help New Zealand get into the final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. Former Australian cricketer Mathew Hayden too would be impressed with Rachin and sing his praises. “He rotates the strike well and has a good sweep shot and a good down-the-ground shot, so he’s the complete package in terms of strike rate and scoring rate. He’s a player of the ages,” Hayden said.
“The beautiful areas are his cover driving,” Hayden said describing him as a classical player. “He gets himself into incredible positions. He’s a very front-foot player but can also rock back, use his height as an advantage and play square of the wicket,” Hayden added.
New Zealand will face India in the final of the Champions Trophy in Dubai. “Once we go to Dubai, we’ll switch back and think about the final,” Rachin said speaking after winning the Player Of The Match against South Africa in the semi-final. New Zealand when faced India in the last group game where thumped by 44 runs earlier in the tournament.

Title: Champions Trophy Final: Matt Henry doubtful for India match

Content:
New Zealand pacer Matt Henry who hurt his shoulder during their semifinal win over South Africa, is a doubtful starter for the Champions Trophy final against India on Sunday. Henry, who is the highest wicket-taker in the tournament so far, picked up an injury while taking the catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen on Wednesday at Lahore.
On Thursday, New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner had remained optimistic about Henry’s availability for the final given there is a three-day rest in between. Moreover, after hurting himself, Henry not only came back to field but alp bowled.
However, speaking to the media on Friday in Dubai, New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said the status of Henry is unknown.
“I guess the positive thing from our perspective is he got back out there to bowl,” Stead said. “We’ve had some scans and stuff done on him, and we’re going to give him every chance to be playing in this match. It’s still a little bit unknown at this stage,” he added.
In recent times since the 2019 World Cup semifinal, Henry has caused all sorts of problems for India’s top-order with his pace and movement. Even in the group stage fixture, Henry walked away with five wickets against India as he troubled them with his seam movement early in the innings.
In case Henry is unavailable, Jacob Duffy is likely to take his spot.
Having arrived from Lahore on Thursday, New Zealand are not training on Friday.

Title: WPL 2025: Mumbai Indians captain Harmanpreet Kaur fined for Code of Conduct breach
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-2025-mumbai-indians-captain-harmanpreet-kaur-fined-for-code-of-conduct-breach-9873596/
Content:
Mumbai Indians captain Harmanpreet Kaur was on Friday fined 10 per cent of her match fee for showing dissent at umpire’s decision during her team’s match against UP Warriorz at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.
The incident occurred at the end of the 19th over of UP Warriorz innings when umpire Ajitesh Argal informed Mumbai Indians skipper Harmanpreet Kaur that only three fielders could be outside the circle in the final over due to a slow over rate.
Seemingly unhappy with the ruling, she was seen engaged in a brief argument with the umpire, with teammate Amelia Kerr also joining the discussion.
Harmanpreet also had a spat with UP Warriorz’s Sophie Ecclestone during the match, when the English cricketer, standing at the non-striker’s end, walked toward the umpire to explain something.
Harmanpreet appeared to respond sharply, seemingly asking Ecclestone to stay out of the conversation.
The exchange prompted intervention from square-leg umpire N Janani and UP Warriorz captain Deepti Sharma, who stepped in to defuse the tension.
“Harmanpreet Kaur admitted to the Level 1 offence under Article 2.8 which relates to showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during a match,” WPL said in a release.
“For Level 1 breaches of the Code of Conduct, the Match Referee’s decision is final and binding.”
Former India captain Mithali Raj has commented on the animated incident between Harmanpreet Kaur and Sophie Eccleston.
“I believe Mumbai Indians were four minutes behind the over rate, which meant they had to bring an extra fielder inside the ring—allowing only three fielders on the boundary,” she told JioHotstar.
“Harmanpreet was likely discussing this with the umpire and reconsidering whether she would have bowled Shabnim Ismail in the 19th over had she known earlier.
“But I couldn’t quite figure out what Ecclestone was trying to do in that moment. As a captain, when you’re already dealing with an over-rate penalty and adjusting your field, it can be frustrating to have another player step into that conversation. I think it was just a moment of emotion.”

Title: Sunil Gavaskar to Rohit Sharma: Are you happy with scoring 25-30 runs?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-to-rohit-sharma-are-you-happy-with-scoring-25-30-runs-9873413/
Content:
Legendary India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has said Team India captain Rohit Sharma shouldn’t be happy by scoring a quick-fire 25-30 and instead look to bat till the 25-30 overs, which will take the game away from the opposition.
Rohit Sharma has failed to convert starts in the ongoing Champions Trophy. Rohit’s highest score is 41 that he made against Bangladesh. Since then, he has gotten scores of 20, 15, and 28.
“As a batter, are you happy with scoring 25-30 runs? You shouldn’t be!” Gavaskar told India Today.
“So that is what I would say to him: your impact on the team will be even greater if you bat for 25 overs instead of just seven, eight, or nine overs,” Gavaskar said.
“If Rohit Sharma bats for even 25 overs, India will be around 180-200. Imagine if they have lost only a couple of wickets by then; just think what they could do. They could reach 350 or more.
“He also needs to give it some thought. It’s one thing to go out and play aggressively, but there has to be a bit of discretion somewhere to give himself the chance to bat for 25-30 overs. If he does that, he takes the game away from the opposition. That kind of impact is match winning,” he said.
Gavaskar has also pointed out the “shortcomings” in India openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, who have failed to give India goo start in the ongoing tournament.
“They haven’t (played to their maximum potential) because when you look at the openers, they haven’t really given the Indian team the kind of start that they had hoped for. That has not happened. So, clearly, I think there’s a shortcoming over there,” said Gavaskar.
India will lock horns against New Zealand in the final of the 2025 Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.

Title: Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I’ve ever seen so it would be stupid not to look at him: Rob Key
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ben-stokes-is-one-of-the-best-captains-ive-ever-seen-so-it-would-be-stupid-not-to-look-at-him-rob-key-9873280/
Content:
Rob Key, managing director of the England men’s cricket team, has said Ben Stokes could be England’s next ODI captain. Key and head coach, Brendon McCullum, face a pivotal decision over how best to replace Jos Buttler as white-ball captain, who stepped down following England’s Champions Trophy exit in the group stage.
“Ben Stokes is one of the best captains I’ve ever seen so it would be stupid not to look at him. It’s just the knock-on effect of what that means,” Key told reporters at Lord’s on Thursday.
“Nothing’s off the table really. You look at every single option and you think: ‘Right, what is the best thing to do?’
“He’s an unbelievably good tactician, which we’ve seen in Test cricket, and he’s a leader of men. He’s someone who gets the best out of people. He’s someone that, when the pressure is really on, he’s able to throw a blanket around the players and actually say, ‘no, no, this is the way forward, keep going with it’. And I think they’re the things that you need in leadership.
“It’s more about, what would it then mean to him? What would that then mean to his workload? We don’t want to risk other things as well. But there’s always a way in England to start looking at what if it goes wrong? You’ve also got to think, what if it goes right?”
Ben Stokes retired from ODIs before returning for last year’s ODI World Cup and last played a T20 in England’s victorious World Cup final in November 2022.
Last year England’s Test captain Ben Stokes had said he would be willing to return to the white-ball setup under new coach Brendon McCullum if he was asked but added that there had been no conversations about him coming back into the limited-overs squads.
“I’ve played a lot of white-ball cricket for England and I’m very happy and content with what I’ve achieved in that form of the game …,” Stokes had told Sky Sports in September last year.
“If I get the call to come and play, then obviously it’s definitely going to be a yes. But I’m not going to be too disappointed if I don’t – it means that I can just sit back and watch everyone else go out and smack it.
“Me and Baz (McCullum) have not spoken about anything like that whatsoever.”

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Matt Henry the first threat India’s star-studded batting line-up has to neutralise in final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-matt-henry-the-first-threat-indias-star-studded-batting-line-up-has-to-neutralise-in-final-9873228/
Content:
There is a smooth, unassuming nature to Matt Henry’s efficiency in One-Day cricket. Even as his bristling action screams a Shane Bond likeness in the final motion at the crease, Henry was not gifted with the yards of extra pace as his Canterbury senior, one of his heroes growing up.
Henry would model his style on that of another bowling great from his boyhood days – an epitome of accuracy who sacrificed pace for line and length, Glenn McGrath.
He may not bear a flamboyant presence on the circuit. But Henry’s impact, or the lack of it, will be grossly felt should he not be a 100 percent fit for New Zealand’s ICC Champions Trophy final against India in Dubai after jamming his right shoulder on the field during the semi-final win over South Africa.
Featuring in his maiden Champions Trophy edition, Henry tops the charts with 10 scalps, building on from his best ODI season in 2023 when he scalped 25 wickets in 17 games. He’s nearly achieved the same numbers this year in double-quick time – 24 in nine games with a wicket every 19 deliveries.
Having jolted India in Dubai last Sunday with a five-for and quite famously in the 2019 World Cup semifinal in Manchester, Henry, shoulder willing, is poised to recreate the new-ball menace again in Dubai. Numbers back him to do so and put him in the same bracket as his teenage heroes, “Pigeon” and “Bondy”.
Relegated to the shadows of Tim Southee and Trent Boult for nearly a decade since his ODI debut in 2014, Henry has subtly climbed up to 165 wickets in 91 matches with an impressive strike rate of 28.6. Only contemporaries Mohammed Shami (25.71) and Mitchell Starc (26.68) have acquired more ODI wickets at a better strike rate than Henry.
The 33-year-old works his magic best in the first Powerplay, a phase where he has collected over 43 percent of his career wickets. Of the six bowlers who have picked up at least 50 scalps in that stage of a game since 2014, Henry’s 72 wickets rank third behind Boult (90) and Chris Woakes (74). His 22.56 average in the phase ranks third-best (for min. 50 wickets) among all bowlers since 2000, only behind McGrath (100 wickets at 20.01) and Bond (65 at 21.29).
With the two wickets in the semifinal that helped him cross the 50-wicket milestone in Asia, Henry also uncannily matched his compatriot Bond’s numbers as an opening bowler in ODIs.
While all 147 of Bond’s career wickets from 80 innings came as an opening bowler, Henry picked up his 148th wicket in his 80th innings as an opening bowler on Wednesday in Lahore, sharing almost identical strike rates with the former Kiwi quick!
As New Zealand hope to end the white-ball ICC trophy drought on Sunday, they have one of the finest visiting seam bowlers in Asia at their disposal. Of the 26 visiting bowlers who have picked up at least 50 ODI wickets in Asia, Henry’s 25.9 strike rate stands distinctly clear at the top.
Henry has also had the wood over India’s superstar top order. Having accounted for each of Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli twice in the format at a combined average of 29.66, it is a no-brainer that India’s first major hurdle with the bat in the final will be against New Zealand’s new ball king, Henry.

Title: Hardik Pandya: The reason why other teams fear India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/hardik-pandya-the-reason-why-other-teams-fear-india-9872678/
Content:
Let’s keep aside the numbers for a bit. In a second consecutive ICC tournament Hardik Pandya is showing what India exactly missed at the 2023 World Cup where despite being the stand-out team, they ended up as runners-up. As India now stand in the final of the Champions Trophy looking to add to the T20 World Cup title they won eight months ago, one aspect has again stood out behind their invincibility – the depth in batting and bowling, which wouldn’t have been possible without the balance that Pandya provides.
Apart from doing their homework right in terms of what to expect here in Dubai, where spinners were expected to be their leader of the bowling pack, India’s think-tank also realised depth in batting is absolutely necessary. In slow conditions, where they have to at times take necessary risks to keep the tempo going, losing wickets is inevitable. And in such circumstances, the batting depth becomes all the more essential where specific roles come into play.
As head coach Gautam Gambhir revealed after their win over Australia in the semi-final, as batting group India’s plan has been simple. To get a rapid start and ensure they go unscathed in the middle-overs and keep wickets in hand when they enter the last 10 overs. In the World Cup final against Ahmedabad, India missed this depth, which meant after they lost Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer by the 11th over, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul had to take the game deep by sacrificing a more intent-driven approach as they had Mohammed Shami coming in at No 8.
Here, the story is different. With a fully-fit Pandya by their side to play the finisher’s role, India now have Ravindra Jadeja slotted for No 8. It has directly empowered the middle-order to take due risks; a leeway that the likes of Shreyas Iyer have been gladly taking on these pitches.
When India have really needed Pandya to finish off the innings in this campaign, he has done with superb efficiency. First against New Zealand, in the most difficult conditions and their seamers taking pace off the ball, he still used his power to score 45 runs that proved to make a huge difference in the end when India defended a total of 249/9. Then in the semi-finals, as Australia sensed a slight opening following the dismissal of Virat Kohli, he walked in at No 7 and scored a 24-ball 28 with three sixes.
On pitches where batsmen have struggled for fluency, he has gone about acing the role. In the end overs, with softer balls and conditions making it difficult to get any pace to work around, Pandya has gone at a strike-rate of 108, which is the highest among all batsmen. Like KL Rahul, even he has been practicing the big shots at the nets, but the difference has been the power.
Pandya the bowler
Pandya’s presence means India are also able to put their spin blueprint to good use. From the time they landed here, it has been evident that at some stage they could play their best four spinners. While their intention has remained the same, India’s think-tank has also been wary of keeping the batting depth intact. And in the last two matches, they have managed to do so thanks to Pandya.
Before the limited-overs series against England, Pandya featured in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 and Vijay Hazare Trophy (VHT) to show where he stands in terms of his bowling. Though he didn’t bowl his entire quota of 10 overs in the VHT, he bowled up to seven overs, which is the sort of number India were looking from him. Here, the moment they decided to drop Harshit Rana and include Varun Chakaravarthy, it showed how much India trusts in Pandya’s bowling.
Against Pakistan, it was Pandya who cracked open the game, first by removing Babar Azam and then Saud Shakeel. Those two telling blows showed Pandya was the best seamer on the afternoon. Against New Zealand it was Pandya who once again gave the opening, removing Rachin Ravindra before the spinners capitalised. Then against Australia, he struggled a bit with his rhythm, but ensured he didn’t end up conceding a big over that could potentially alter the course.
For a seamer who mostly hits the back of the length areas, which is the ideal area to bowl on these surfaces, Pandya has been managed to extract movement with the new ball. At the same time when he comes for his second spell, he has shown the maturity to use the cutters and slower balls, making it difficult for batsmen to score off. Eight months ago at Barbados as India ended their ICC title drought, Pandya bowled two crunch overs, taking key wickets of Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller.
On Sunday, when they face New Zealand in the final, India will once again need Pandya the bowler as much as Pandya the batsman. Without him, India isn’t an India team that other teams fear.

Title: Champions Trophy final: Why India vs New Zealand is more like India vs CSK
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-final-why-india-vs-new-zealand-is-more-like-india-vs-csk-9872482/
Content:
Come Sunday, apart from India which already feels at home in these ‘neutral conditions’, New Zealand too would feel they are in with genuine chance. These conditions, similar to Chepauk, is familiar territory for the likes of Rachin Ravindra, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner and Matt Henry. Through their long stints with Chennai Super Kings, they would be familiar with the characteristics of the pitches.
This has been the theme of the pitches in Dubai in the in the four Champions Trophy games—slow and sluggish at times; getting slower and slower as the game progresses; a bit of turn to keep the batsmen guessing; low bounce and a decent carry where the wicketkeepers largely collect the ball around the midriff. If Stephen Fleming packs this square and places it at the MA Chidambaram Stadium later this month, CSK would look completely at home.
Prior to this season, which included Tests in Sri Lanka and India and a tri-series and the Champions Trophy, Rachin trained on similar pitches at the CSK Academy in Chennai. On the back of it, he enjoyed a productive outing everywhere and is second-highest run-getter (226 runs) with two centuries in this tournament. Before Rachin, fellow opener Conway trained in Chennai when the IPL was on before joining the Black Caps. “There is definitely some element to it,” Sriram Krishnamurthy, the head coach of CSK Academy, tells The Indian Express.
“Ultimately, we have to understand sometimes the advantages of where they are from. The New Zealand cricket calendar is not as crowded as maybe the English calendar or an Australian one. So, from that perspective, some of these players have windows which they can dedicate to taking their games forward. Ultimately, adapting is only going to happen when you are going to get familiar with conditions,” he explains.
Familiarisation is key, he emphasises. “Maybe like with almost 50% of cricket being played in the subcontinent, they don’t travel to these parts frequently. So, if you are able to familiarise yourself in between, nothing like it. IPL obviously gives some of these players the ability to experience these subcontinental conditions,” says Sriram, who was earlier the coach of Northern Districts in New Zealand domestic circuit.
Once here, the likes of Rachin, Conway and Mitchell have ensured they are able to fit their game into what the conditions demand rather than looking for new solutions. While visiting batsmen to Indian shores usually rely extensively on sweeps against spinners, New Zealand have been different. Be it using their feet or covering both their edges and ensuring there is a fine line between attacking and defending, they have emerged successful. Last Sunday against India, their approach was similar only for Varun Chakaravarthy to conjure magic.
Each has different ways. For Conway, easily the best player against spin amongst them, the challenge according to Sriram has been to understand the conditions. During his time at CSK Academy, Rachin, who prefers playing off the back foot, trained to get used to do it in slow, turning pitches while also learning to use his feet more to get down the pitch. In the absence of a conventional sweep, Rachin learnt to put slog sweep to good effect. Mitchell, with spinners knowing he enjoys the sweeps and reverse-sweeps, looked to come down the pitch more and hit them straight.
“There is a vast difference to how you play spinners in New Zealand to here. If you have the same game, you will get exposed. When you have multiple options against the same ball, it sort of empowers you to put more pressure on the bowler and that’s what is needed in these conditions. That is the layer they have added to their batting. I think all New Zealand cricketers, ultimately, all pride themselves on being smart. Alongside, they develop the requisite skills that are going to support that thinking,” Sriram says.
Sriram, during his stint with the High Performance Centre in New Zealand, has also seen how creative the Kiwis get in terms of improving their game against the spinners even if it means they have to train indoors during the off season. “If they are coming just three-four days before a tour starts, they don’t give it as an excuse. Their preparation starts with how they get creative with practice in that pre-camp in New Zealand. It might be as simple as just asking for the curators to leave very dry pitches so they can prepare, bat and bowl on dry pitches. If it is an indoor facility, they will spill some sand and gravel on the floor, maybe some nets and nettings too. So ultimately, they don’t complain. They come prepared,” Sriram says.
Of course, this is not just limited to batsmen. Their captain and lead spinner Santner, since the 2018 IPL season, has been Ravindra Jadeja’s understudy. During the IPL months, in each of their training sessions, Santner would keep a close tab on how Jadeja goes about. In five seasons with CSK, he played only 18 matches, but every time he heads back to New Zealand, he has taken home valuable lessons that he has been putting to use here like the subtle variations in speeds. Against South Africa in the semi-finals, Santner used his variation in speed to get rid of Temba Bavuma and Rassie van der Dussen.
“When somebody isn’t playing they can easily get distracted and lose sight of the fact that they can still make it productive. When he isn’t playing, his attitude is to see how best he can learn. And obviously having someone like Jadeja at CSK would have definitely helped him because they have similar skills. Previously, he was known to be more of a bowler who can bowl on the quicker side and was not a big turner. But then you look at him for the last 2 or 3 years, you can see he is able to slow the ball down now. He is able to get more turn,” Sriram says.
Last Sunday against India presented the most challenging conditions they have encountered so far in Dubai. But going into the final against the same opponents, India know they have a real task in their hands and unless they bring out their A-game, New Zealand could after all end up proving their nemesis once again in an ICC event. Those are not misplaced fears or a team that is unbeaten so far trying to be humble. If one team other than India can effortlessly get used to the conditions in Dubai, then it is hard to look beyond New Zealand.

Title: With Mushfiqur Rahim’s ODI retirement, Bangladesh formally move on from golden generation

Content:
With the One Day International retirement of wicketkeeping and batting mainstay, Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh formally moved on from the generation which produced the likes of world-class talents in Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad.
After a rather poor show at the Champions Trophy 2025, where Bangladesh were knocked out from the group stage after losing to eventual finalists India and New Zealand, Mushfiqur announced his retirement on Wednesday.
The 37-year-old took to Instagram and penned an emotional message announcing his retirement from ODI cricket. “Assalamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. I am announcing my retirement from the ODI format as of today,” he wrote.
“Alhamdulillah for everything. While our achievements may have been limited on a global level, one thing is certain: whenever I stepped onto the field for my country, I gave more than 100% with dedication and honesty,” the post added.
READ | ‘It was not ideal’: David Miller criticises Champions Trophy scheduling after semi-final loss to New Zealand
A veteran of 274 ODIs, Mushfiqur has scored 7795 runs — the second-most runs in for Bangladesh in the 50-over format after Tamim Iqbal — in ODIs, including 49 fifties and nine centuries.
Rahim made his ODI debut in August 2006 against Zimbabwe. His wicketkeeping resume in ODIs is impressive too. He took 243 catches and made 56 stumpings, the most by any Bangladesh cricketer in this format.
Having retired from T20Is following the 2022 T20 World Cup, Mushfiqur also holds the Bangladesh record for most consecutive ODIs. He played 92 consecutive matches between 2010 and 2016.
He also admitted things were not easy for him in the recent past and showed gratitude to his loved ones. “The last few weeks have been very challenging for me, and I have come to realize that this is my destiny. Lastly, I would like to deeply thank my family, friends and my fans for whom I have played cricket for the last 19 years,” he said.

Title: ‘Putting India under pressure in Dubai gave us…’: New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner fires warning before Champions Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-pressure-dubai-confidence-new-zealand-santner-champions-trophy-final-9871730/
Content:
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner has signalled a warning for Team India ahead of the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, adding that putting Rohit Sharma’s side under pressure in the league-stage match in Dubai offered the Kiwis a confidence boost for the semi-final win in Lahore.
Despite going down by 44 runs in a 250-run chase last Sunday, New Zealand brought their A-game to the semi-final against South Africa, smashing a Champions Trophy record total of 362 for six after centuries from opener Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson.
While Santner’s men could not quite nail the win against India in Dubai, he shared the tight contest headlined by the spinners gave a shot in the arm nevertheless. “Being there in Dubai and putting India under pressure gave us confidence. You take in what things work and what doesn’t. I think the bowlers bowled well to chip wickets at the top. I think winning the toss will be nice as well,” Santner told reporters after New Zealand drubbed South Africa by 50 runs on Wednesday.
“It’s a cool feeling to make the final. We were challenged by a good side. We’ve had a go against India, look forward to do it again,” Santner said.
The skipper also lauded former captain Williamson who has stepped up under the knockout heat. While Williamson cracked his 15th ODI century and cross 19,000 international runs during the semis, he also steered the chase against India last week with a steely 81 off 120 deliveries.
“Williamson keeps doing it. That partnership (with Rachin) was massive. Might’ve been frustrated a touch at times, but they flipped the switch earlier and got us to 360. Looking back, 320 might not have been enough,” remarked Santner.

Content:
South Africa’s lone warrior in the Champions Trophy 2025 semi-final against New Zealand in Lahore, David Miller, lashed out at the ICC over scheduling after the Proteas were knocked out of the tournament following a 50-run loss on Wednesday.
The strange schedule of the Champions Trophy led both Australia and South Africa to travel to Dubai from Pakistan after the group stage to prepare for the potential semi-final clash against India.
But when the Rohit Sharma men beat the Kiwis in their last group game, setting up a semi-final clash with Australia, the South African team had to fly back to Pakistan for their semi-final match against New Zealand.
“It’s only an hour and 40 minute flight, but the fact that we had to do that was not ideal,” Miller said after South Africa’s exit from the tournament. The South African team left for Dubai from Karachi on Sunday afternoon and was back in Lahore on Monday.
“It’s early morning, it’s after a game and we had to fly. Then we got to Dubai at 4:00 pm. And at 7.30 am we had to come back. It doesn’t make it nice. It’s not like we flew five hours, and we had enough time to recover and recuperate, but it was not an ideal situation still,” he said.
READ | Will injured Matt Henry play in India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy final?
Miller scored an unbeaten 67-ball century, consisting of 10 fours and four sixes, but it went in vain after South Africa fell short by 50 runs chasing a Champions Trophy record total of 363 runs.
New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner claimed three scalps as Kiwi tweakers shared seven out of nine wickets in the game.
The 35-year-old South African believe that the wicket deteriorated as the game went on. “It’s not easy chasing 360 even if it’s a good wicket. I think the wicket just deteriorated as the game went on and they spun the ball a lot more than us. It’s just they got a little bit more purchase out of the wicket,” said Miller.
Earlier, Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson’s centuries guided New Zealand to post the highest total (362/6) in the Champions Trophy.
Miller also backed New Zealand to beat India in the final. “I’ll be honest with you, I think I’ll be supporting New Zealand,” he said.

Title: How Saud Shakeel became first Pakistan batter to be dismissed ‘timed out’ during domestic FC match
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/saud-shakeel-timed-out-dismissal-record-fc-pakistan-9871568/
Content:
Only days out from Pakistan’s Champions Trophy exit, Saud Shakeel entered the record books for his unusual dismissal during the domestic President’s Trophy final in Rawalpindi.
Slotted at number five for the State Bank of Pakistan side, Shakeel was adjudged timed out after he failed to walk out in time after Pakistan Television pacer dislodged captain Umar Amin and Fawad Alam off successive deliveries. While Shakeel walked out after the quick collapse, he was deemed to be timed out by the on-field umpire, marking a rare piece of First-Class history as the first Pakistan batter to suffer such an exit.
Shakeel’s dismissal not only raised eyebrows but is also the first high-profile dismissal of the kind since Angelo Mathews’ no-show against Bangladesh in the 2023 ODI World Cup.
According to an ESPNcricinfo report, Shakeel arrived at the crease to face the delivery after the quick collapse, but PTV captain Amad Butt appealed, and the umpires agreed that the Test batter had not been ready within three minutes.
One of the 10 modes of dismissals in cricket, the timed out dismissal was officially incorporated in the Laws of Cricket only in 1980. According to Law 40.1.1, "After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball, or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 3 minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out."
Interestingly, Shakeel's timed out dismissal was the first of its kind in professional First-Class cricket since 2017-18 and only the seventh such instance in history.
Besides Angelo Mathews' controversial dismissal in the 2023 World Cup, Ghana's Godfred Bakiweyem is the only other cricketer to be timed out in international cricket, dismissed in the fashion during a T20I against Sierra Leone in 2023.
Following Shakeel's exit, PTV seamer Shahzad claimed a hat-trick off the next delivery, and proceeded to claim figures of 5/29 to bundle State Bank of Pakistan for 205. In reply, PTV slipped to 49/3 before stumps on day two.
The President’s Trophy has also been noted for the unusual timings, owing to the holy month of Ramadan where devout Muslims do not consume food between sunrise and sunset. Consequently, the tournament is being played throughout the night, with sessions from 7:30 pm to 2:30 am.

Title: ‘They left no legacy’: Mohammed Hafeez slams ’90s Pakistan team in live TV exchange with Shoaib Akhtar
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-90s-team-no-legacy-hafeez-shoaib-akhtar-tv-show-9871470/
Content:
Hosting their first ICC tournament in over two decades, Pakistan’s early group-stage exit from the Champions Trophy has triggered widespread criticism from former cricketers and experts. The Mohammad Rizwan-led side failed to notch up a win in three games, losing to New Zealand and India while their final game at home against Bangladesh was washed out.
However, former Pakistan captain and head coach Mohammed Hafeez curiously targetted the yesteryear stars of the country in failing to inspire the next generations. Hafeez’s comments made for an awkward exchange during the OutSide Edge Live show, which also comprised ’90s Pakistan pace sensation Shoaib Akhtar, besides Shoaib Malik and Sana Mir.
“I am a huge fan of those who played in the 1990s but when it comes to legacy, they left nothing for Pakistan. They didn't win an ICC event - they lost the (World Cups of) 1996, 1999 and 2003. We reached one final (in the 1999 World Cup) and lost that badly."
"As stars, as players, they were the mega superstars. But then they couldn't inspire us by winning an ICC event. Then came a difficult period that we had to go through and then in 2007 we lost the final (of the T20 World Cup). In 2009 we won under Younis Khan's captaincy and so there was an inspiration for the next generation. Then unfortunately a bad incident happened with Pakistan cricket and we have still not been able to recover from that. Then we won the 2017 Champions Trophy, that was a huge source of inspiration. People idolise Babar Azam today and that is because even if he didn't play a big hand in that event, he was there."
While Hafeez trashed the legacy left by the Pakistan mega stars, Shoaib Akhar reminded him that the country's superior One-Day record against India was fortified during his time. "These 73 one-dayers that Pakistan won against India, it is us who won it." While Hafeez attempt to acknowledge the efforts led by Imran Khan, Akhtar interrupted and said: “No you can't cover up now, this video has been made already. You've already spoken about all big players.”
Pakistan will next tour New Zealand for a white-ball series, starting March 16. Helmed by interim head coach Aaqib Javed, Pakistan have rejigged their white-ball teams yet again with Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan dropped from the T20I set up and Salman Agha taking over as skipper. While Rizwan retained captaincy for the ODIs, left-arm seamer Shaheen Afridi was dropped from the 50-overs set-up.

Title: ‘Aaqib Javed is a clown’: Jason Gillespie slams Pakistan interim head coach for ‘campaigning’ for all-format role
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/aaqib-javed-clown-comment-jason-gillespie-pakistan-coach-9871285/
Content:
Former Australia pacer Jason Gillespie, who left his role as Pakistan’s Test head coach last December, slammed the current interim head coach Aaqib Javed for campaigning for the role across formats, labelling him a “clown” on a social media post.
Gillespie’s reaction came on the back of Javed’s lament that the constant management and team personnel changes across formats hampered Pakistan’s performance across formats. Hosts of the ongoing Champions Trophy, Pakistan suffered a group-stage exit with defeats to New Zealand and India before their final game against Bangladesh was washed out.
“We have changed nearly 16 coaches and 26 selectors in the last two years or so,” he was quoted as saying at a news conference to announce the latest overhaul of Pakistan’s limited-overs squads. “You put that formula on any team in the world, I think they will also be in the same situation. Until you get consistency right from the top down to the bottom, from the chairman down, then your team will not progress.”
Gillespie called Javed’s remarks “hilarious”. The former Australia quick who played international cricket for 10 years, appearing in 71 tests and 97 ODIs, was appointed last April for two years as Pakistan’s test coach but quit before a series in South Africa less than eight months later after an unsuccessful start.
Gillespie was the second foreigner to leave Pakistan’s program in less than two months after South African Gary Kirsten stepped down as limited-overs coach in October.
“Aaqib was clearly undermining Gary and I behind the scenes campaigning to be the coach in all formats,” Gillespie posted. “He is a clown.”
Javed’s interim coaching job was set to be until the Champions Trophy. However, with the Pakistan Cricket Board yet to seek a replacement, Javed will continue in the role for the team’s tour to New Zealand, starting March 16.

Title: Will injured Matt Henry play in India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy final?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-matt-henry-play-india-vs-new-zealand-champions-trophy-final-9871210/
Content:
New Zealand qualified for their first Champions Trophy final since 2009 on Wednesday after Mitchell Santner’s side quashed South Africa by 50 runs in a high-scoring contest at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. While the BlackCaps were clinical across departments, they were dealt a huge body blow ahead of the final against India on Sunday, with seam spearhead Matt Henry suffering a shoulder injury during the match.
Henry suffered the injury during the 29th over of South Africa’s chase as he held onto a low catch of Heinrich Klaasen while running in from long on. Visibly in pain after jamming his right shoulder with the ground, Henry was forced off the field. However, the 33-year-old returned to bowl two more overs and picked up the wicket of Kagiso Rabada, finishing with figures of 2/43 in seven overs.
Addressing Henry’s situation, captain Santner said that the pacer had a sore shoulder, and the team management would have to wait a couple of days to understand the extent of the injury. The Kiwis have a three-day break before Sunday’s final in Dubai.
“Have to wait and see how Matt Henry’s shoulder is. It’s a bit sore, we have to wait for a couple of days and see,” Santner said in the post-match presentation.
Henry is the leading wicket-taker of the tournament, having scalped 10 wickets in four outings.
Henry was the key threat for India in the league-stage match held in Dubai last Sunday, as he walked away with the first five-wicket haul of the tournament. Snipping the likes of Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami, Henry helped the Kiwis restrict India to 249/9 in 50 overs. However, a fine spin display led by Varun Chakaravarthy’s five-wicket haul helped India see off New Zealand by 44 runs in their last league-stage match.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Why India should be wary of New Zealand in the final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-why-india-wary-of-new-zealand-in-final-9870864/
Content:
In Sunday’s ICC Champions Trophy final, India will face New Zealand, a side that will give them a stiff challenge. Having already played India at the venue last Sunday, New Zealand know what to expect in terms of conditions, which South Africa wouldn’t have had, if they had made it. The Indian Express takes a look at the reasons that make New Zealand a strong side to overcome in the final.
If there is any team in the Champions Trophy that could match or come close to India in terms of spin bowling resources, it is the Kiwis. Led by left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, they have three other spin bowling options in Michael Bracewell, Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra. So in terms of variety in the spin department, they have their bases covered. In their group match, India came out prepared to deal with them and emerged successful. But this time, New Zealand will come back fully aware of what exactly to do in these conditions. With the final set to be played on the same pitch that was used for India’s game against Pakistan, the Kiwi spinners will have a big role to play.

What caught India by surprise against the Kiwis was the movement their seamers were able to generate with the new ball. In the other three matches that India have played here, seam movement has been non-existent. But against Kiwis, it was different. Part of it can be attributed to the height of their pacers – who are all tall – and because they bowl a good length and there is more air time, there is more chance of movement in the air. To go with their movement, the extra bounce that they generate has also troubled India’s top order in recent times across all formats in ICC events. India need to come up with a definite plan to counter this as runs in the first Powerplay are crucial.
As they showed last Sunday with their fielding, New Zealand are capable of saving 30-40 runs in the field. If that isn't enough, they often convert half-chances into catches. In any other team, the likes of Santner, Will Young and Michael Bracewell could be considered top fielders, but here they have Glenn Phillips, who can change the course of the game with his exceptional fielding. With all their best fielders in the ring when the spinners operate, they can apply pressure by cutting off singles. And if the ball is anywhere in their range, they dive around to take blinders. So India know they have to earn every run, and that in itself adds to the pressure.
Like India, the Black Caps have a batting line-up well suited to the conditions. Though they didn't quite pull it off during their chase on Sunday, they have the quality to not be written off. In Rachin, Young and Kane Williamson, they have a top three that can not just provide rapid starts, but also hang around long enough to build a base for the middle order. While most teams have struggled against India's spinners, the Kiwis can change that trend thanks to the likes of Tom Latham, Daryll Mitchell and Phillips, who are all good against tweakers. The other night, they were undone by a special performance from Varun Chakaravarthy, but come Sunday they will be prepared.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Kane-Rachin masterclass and overall professionalism take New Zealand into final against India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-champions-trophy-fina-south-africa-record-total-9870694/
Content:
There was a moment when Kane Williamson was still new to the crease and struggling to find his touch, when he stood peering at an offending spot on the pitch, somewhere on a good-length area. He had a quizzical look on his face as if to suggest ‘this pitch isn’t quite what we expected, we have to adapt’.
It was the end of an over from Kagiso Rabada during the first Powerplay, and he walked across to have a chat with his partner Rachin Ravindra, who would later say that “the pitch held up at times, looked a bit crumbly,” but how “Kane helped me”. The ball had begun to show signs of stopping a touch and it was clear then that it was a great toss to win.
Not only did the New Zealanders adapt, they didn’t even settle for a lower target. Instead, the pair changed the way they batted, and instead of attempting to hit on the up and through the line, smartly used the crease and angles so brilliantly that South Africa didn’t have answers. Only Lungi Ngidi impressed, with a slew of slower cutters, but the rest floundered.
‘Masterclass’ is a word often used as a throwaway remark, but the way Williamson and Rachin stitched together their match-winning partnership worth 164 runs deserves the tag. It was their stand that was the architect of the 50-run win that took the Kiwis into the ICC Champions Trophy final against India. Especially when juxtaposed with South Africa’s lame effort with the bat in the chase. Admittedly, the target of 363 was mammoth, but they batted as if they hadn’t bowled on the pitch, sticking to their old methods and looking surprised when the ball got stuck in the pitch and stopped on them. David Miller helped himself to a hundred in the end, but the game had ceased to be a contest much before that.
Suffice to say here that India have the tougher opposition on their hands in the final; if anyone can upset their applecart, it’s New Zealand – not South Africa. Such was their clinical professionalism, smarts – with bat and ball- and composure.
When Williamson’s punches and drives on the up didn’t bring the desired results, he began to unfurl his trickery – the late-cut, dabs, flicks, wristy on-drives. Suddenly, he was up and running. Once Williamson found his touch, South Africa began to crumble.
As compared to Williamson, Rachin was always flowing. When the ball was new in the Powerplay, he punched it to get boundaries. Initially, South Africa thought a short-ball ploy could work. Mistake. Rachin crunched a couple of pulls off the front foot. They then hurled it fuller, and the balls were thrown back from the straight boundary as he creamed them with the full face of the bat.
The scorecard won’t reveal how well Keshav Maharaj bowled. If he were bowling to his own batsmen, one can easily imagine a five-for, he was that good. But Williamson came into his own against him.
He employed two tactics to throw Maharaj off the perch. He would occasionally step outside leg-stump, and mix it up by moving down the track but getting outside off in the process. He could either cut or ping cow corner with that approach. Against such inventiveness, especially in the calm manner that Williamson pulled it off, Maharaj didn’t stand a chance. And the left-handed Rachin hurt him more by moving down the track to smear him straight or hit with the turn.
Barring Maharaj, there was only Ngidi who tried to be smart with his cutters. Even Rabada had begun to flounder. In the end overs, they got smacked all around the park by Glenn Phillips and Daryl Mitchell.
The South African chase got off to a meandering start. Temba Bavuma couldn’t get going initially but to his credit, recovered in the company of Rassie van der Dussen with a 105-run partnership in almost 17 overs. This was where the New Zealand captain revealed his trump card: himself.
If Maharaj was good, Mitchell Santner was even better. Unlike Maharaj, whose range went from slow to slower, Santner also gets quickish turn. Admittedly, the pitch had begun to help him a lot more by then, but he was skilfull and cerebral with his art. One gripped and broke past the iffy prod from Van Der Dussen to clatter his off-stump. Four overs before that, he had slowed up the pace on one and got it to turn, inducing Bavuma’s intended hoick to spiral up to backward point. Suddenly, South Africa were 161 for 3 in the 27th over.

Much then depended on Heinrich Klaasen but Santner intervened again. Increasingly playing the ball off the pitch, Klaasen kept going back. But such was the match situation that he still had to try and conjure big shots, and he made the mistake of trying to punch-heave Santner off the backfoot. The ball stuck in the pitch, popped up ever so slowly and the catch was swallowed at long-on. It was 167 for 4, and when Aiden Markram patted a ball from Rachin, that again stopped a touch, back to the bowler South Africa were wobbling away like intoxicated men at 189 for 5 in 33 overs.

Title: ‘Not buying into it’: Steve Smith dismisses theory that India had edge because of playing all games in Dubai
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/steve-smith-dismisses-theory-india-edge-dubai-hybrid-model-9870483/
Content:
Did the Indian cricket team have an unfair advantage at the ongoing Champions Trophy? The are after all the only team to play all their games at the same venue in Dubai while the rest of the countries had to play theirs at multiple venues in Pakistan besides a game in Dubai against India? Australian stand-in skipper Steve Smith does not think so, disagreeing with some pundits and players who have voiced their concerns about the hybrid model.
After Smith’s team lost to India by four wickets in the semi-finals on Tuesday at the Dubai International Stadium, the stand-in skipper conceded that they had been “outplayed” by a superior team.
“I’m not buying into it (India’s familiarity with pitch and condition). India obviously played some really good cricket here. The surface kind of suits their style with the spinners that they’ve got,” Smith said during the post-match press conference on Tuesday night. “And they have the seamers at their disposal for a wicket like that. They played well, they outplayed us and they deserve the victory.”
Smith added that Australia could have crossed the 300-run mark after being 198/4 at one stage. But they had lost the way, and ended up setting a 265-run target for India.
“We had our opportunities throughout to post something up above 300. We were probably just that one wicket down too many at a few stages throughout the innings. If we extended one of those partnerships a little bit we’re probably getting up 290-300 and we’re putting a bit of pressure on the scoreboard,” Smith said.
Talking about the pitch at the Dubai International Stadium, Smith said: “It’s clearly not the easiest wicket to bat on. The square block as a whole has seen a lot of cricket over the last couple of months. We can see it’s pretty tired and that’s probably the reason why we haven’t seen a score above 300 in the tournament here so far. So, we did a reasonable job but we probably just lacked a couple of those partnerships just dragging out a little bit further to get us up somewhere near 300 or just above.”

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘India have played flawless cricket but there is one more game to go’: Gautam Gambhir
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-gautam-gambhir-india-flawless-final-9870496/
Content:
On Tuesday, until Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer put together a 91-run stand, India and Australia were punching and counter-punching. Their batsmen, especially Stave Smith and Alex Carey put the spinner-heavy Indian bowling attack under pressure.
Be it against Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand, India have been ruthless in the execution of their bowling plans. But Australia, despite playing in totally different conditions to what they did in Pakistan, quickly adapted to the pitch. With the early wickets of Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma, they even got early breakthroughs before chase-master Kohli settled the nerves and played a lovely innings.
Sunday’s final will be an opportunity for India to end their 50-over ICC trophy drought, dating back to the 2013 Champions Trophy. For head coach Gautam Gambhir its a chance to establish his credentials with the national team following IPL success.
Speaking to the media shortly after India’s win against Australia, Gambhir said the campaign so far has been flawless.
“You used a very good word that we played ‘flawlessly’. I think yes we did but we still have one more game to go. We know that we are a good one-day side and the most important thing is the way we’ve actually played throughout this competition. The hunger, the commitment, and the eagerness to try and do something special for the country is always there in the dressing room,” Gambhir said.
In his first trip as head coach to Sri Lanka, where the ODIs were played on similar sluggish tracks, Indian batsmen struggled to chase targets between 230-250. Though they had managed good starts back then in the powerplay, in the middle-overs they struggled to keep the scoreboard moving without taking risks. Over here, Indian batsmen have adapted well, rotating the strike and being able to produce risk-free cricket. With the ball, in each of the four outings they have managed to take all 10 wickets. And even on the field, they have hardly put a foot wrong.
Though he called it flawless, Gambhir said India haven’t managed to tick all boxes as far as he is concerned. “See, in international sport, you want to keep improving. You don’t say that you’ve ticked all the boxes. There’s always room to improve. There’s always something to improve, be it in batting, fielding, or bowling. And we still haven’t played a perfect game. We still have one more game to go. Hopefully we can play a perfect game,” Gambhir said.
Since taking over, Gambhir has rejigged the batting order with Axar Patel being the favoured batsman at No.5 followed by KL Rahul. And before the Champions Trophy, during the series against England, Shreyas Iyer had revealed that he wasn’t even a sure starter, an indication that Gambhir was looking for other options.
In T20Is India have brought a great deal of flexibility to the batting order, which includes a good mix of left and right-handed batsmen, but in ODIs the story is totally different. With Rishabh Pant not being the first-choice wicketkeeper, India have just two left-handed batsmen in the top 7 and since the top four are all right-handers, Gambhir has chosen to have Axar at No.5 with Rahul now batting one position below.
Gambhir said the reason behind the move was to see the impact a batsman has on a particular spot. “You know in a sport like cricket and in a team sport, numbers don’t matter, batting positions don’t matter, it’s the impact that matters. You should only be thinking of picking yourself in the playing 11, and whatever is needed you should do it for the team. And KL has done that and KL has done that really happily and he’s done that really well at number six as well,” he said.

Having Rahul at No.6 means, India’s depth extends to No.8 where Ravindra Jadeja is slotted to bat. With Kuldeep Yadav also quite handy with the bat, it has undoubtedly strengthened India’s cause, where even if they have to take risks with the bat, they can because of the depth. “People keep talking about it, I don’t know for how long they’ve been talking about it, why we’ve pushed KL at number six. Just we feel that he gives us more depth, and that is how we want to play the game. And the conversations which I’ve had with him or the conversations which I’ve had with everyone are exactly the same that in a team sport, especially in cricket and in this format, we are not going to talk about batting positions,” Gambhir said.

New Zealand smashed the highest ever team total in Champions Trophy history when they put up 362/6 against South Africa in the 2nd semifinal in Lahore on Wednesday. This is the 3rd time that the highest total in the history of the tournament has been breached in the 2025 edition alone with England’s 351/8 chased down by Australia when they scored 356/5 last month in their Group B encounter. Interestingly, both the matches have been in Lahore.
Before that, the highest ever score was also held by the Kiwis when they had scored 347/4 against USA at the Oval in 2004. Hosts Pakistan’s 338/4 in Oval in 2017 against India is currently in the 5th position.
New Zealand’s 362/6 was also the 3rd highest team total in the history of the ICC tournament knockout ties, coming behind India’s 397/4 against the Kiwis in the ODI World Cup 2023 semifinal and the Black Caps’ 393/6 against West Indies in the ODI World Cup 2015 quarterfinals.
In the match on Wednesday, both Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson scored centuries while Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips chipped in with quickfire knocks to help the Kiwis post the massive total.
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won the toss and opted to bat against South Africa in the second semifinal of the Champions Trophy here Wednesday.
The winner of the contest will face India, who beat Australia in the first semifinal on Tuesday, in the summit clash in Dubai on Sunday.

New Zealand retained their playing XI for this knockout clash whereas South Africa made one change, with skipper Temba Bavuma coming back into the side replacing Tristan Stubbs.

Title: ‘You cannot build pressure on him’: Ashton Agar lauds Virat Kohli’s knock vs AUS in Champions Trophy semifinal
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ashton-agar-laus-virat-kohli-vs-australia-9870202/
Content:
Australian spinner Ashton Agar said that it was pretty difficult to build any pressure on Virat Kohli when he is in such hot form. This was after Kohli scored an impressive 84 runs against Australia in the Champions Trophy semifinal on Tuesday, helping to guide India to the final.
“It is not the damage that he can do to the fence, it’s just the fact that you cannot build pressure on him. So it’s really hard to get him out in a sense. You never really feel like you’re on top of him unless the ball is really spinning. And you don’t get a lot of pitches in one-day cricket like that,” Agar said on ESPNcricinfo’s Match Day.
“That’s the frustrating part about bowling to him. He has this fantastic ability to hit your best ball, the top of middle stump, slightly spinning away, he holds the bat’s face slightly longer than other batters do, opens it in the last second, and hits it in the cover point gap. He’s probably the best in the world at doing that and he’s very difficult to build pressure on,” he added.
Coming early in the fifth over after Shubman Gill fell early to Ben Dwarshuis, Kohli scored 84 runs in 98 balls with five fours and got out in the 43rd over with the team in a comfortable position. India chased down the target in the 49th over with KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja guiding the team to the final.

Known for his impeccable approach during run chases, Virat focused on rotating the strike during the middle overs against Australia spinners Adam Zampa, Cooper Connolly, and Tanveer Sangha.

Title: WATCH: Sachin Tendulkar reminded of days as a 14-year-old after revisiting Vadodara
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sachin-tendulkar-motibaug-ground-vadodara-masters-league-video-9870054/
Content:
Former Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was reminded of his early days when he visited Motibaug Cricket Ground in Vadodara (earlier Baroda) as a 14-year-old with the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team after visiting the same place 37 years later.
Playing for the Indian Masters in the ongoing International Masters League (IML) T20, 2025, Tendulkar and the whole team were practising ahead of their clash against Australia Masters on Wednesday.
In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, Tendulkar shared his childhood memory of Vadodara and his experience of playing at that venue.
“The ground you can see behind me, I came here as a 14-year-old with the Mumbai Ranji team. I was part of the 14-member squad. This is Motibaug (Cricket) Ground and here (pointing towards his left) was our dressing room. All those memories have suddenly picked up. I still remember that they had put up tents and everything and a massive crowd came to see the match, but I am here for a different reason,” said the Indian maestro in the video.
Sachin made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bombay (now Mumbai) at the age of 15 years and 232 days against Gujarat on December 11, 1988. Playing in his home ground at the Wankhede Stadium, Tendulkar scored an unbeaten century, making himself the youngest Indian to score a hundred on First-Class debut.
The inaugural season of IML is being played in three cities. The tournament started at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai before the caravan moved to Vadodara, where all the matches will be held at the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) Stadium (also known as Kotambi Stadium). The last seven games, including three knockout matches, will be played at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium, Raipur.
The India Masters sit at the top of the points table, having won all three matches against Sri Lanka, England and South Africa Masters.
Tendulkar has scored 50 in three innings, with 34 being his highest individual score against England.

Title: Why India prefer KL Rahul over Rishabh Pant in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/why-india-prefer-kl-rahul-over-rishabh-pant-in-champions-trophy-9870093/
Content:
KL Rahul couldn’t help himself in the moment. Just as Virat Kohli was walking past him, dismissed playing a big shot in the end moments of the semifinal against Australia, Rahul blurted out in apparent exasperation, ‘Mein maar tha ..’ (I was hitting) – words to that effect. And he was. He had perfectly sussed out the match situation, had taken the aggressive role, letting Kohli flow through unhindered, but an instinctive reaction had felled Kohli, who would later be seen explaining why he played that shot to his team-mates Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant.
But that understanding and playing the situation is the reason why Gautam Gambhir has chosen to go with Rahul, rather than Pant. In this Indian team, with Hardik Pandya the designated big hitter in the lower order, and with allrounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel on either side, Gambhir and Rohit Sharma’s punt has been to go with the solidity of Rahul, especially considering the sluggish conditions in Dubai. It has worked out rather well for India, thus far. And especially when Rahul is more than capable of the big hitting; he even has been exclusively working on them in the training sessions.
One of the constant themes in India’s net sessions in Dubai has been the sight of Rahul invariably walking in among the first set of batsmen and indulging in some big hits. It hasn’t mattered whether he is facing the seamers or spinners or throwdown specialists. His intention has been very clear – to bring out a big shot, especially via aerial, as early as possible. Sometimes it happens off the first ball, if not the second or later, but there have been at least three such big hits by the time he has faced 10 deliveries. These haven’t been the power-hitting that many T20 globetrotters put themselves through, but more of him getting used to the situation he is going to come across more often than not when he walks out at No 6.
It isn’t an easy role that Rahul has chosen to embrace. When there are failures, which will definitely be there because that’s the nature of the beast, questions will be raised over his spot particularly when Pant is warming the bench. Rahul admitted there is little margin of error.
“There is – I won’t lie. I mean, he’s obviously a very, very talented player and he’s shown all of us what he can do and how aggressive and how quickly he can change the game. So yes, there’s always the temptation for the team as well, whoever’s the captain, the coach too – there’s always that temptation to either play him or play me. There’s always that. But yeah, for me, I just if I’m given the opportunity, I try and see what I can do best.” So far, he has been nailing those opportunities.

It isn’t easy being Rahul, though. Irrespective of the format, there are always some talks going around him good and bad both. These days his stocks as a T20 batsman may have gone down, in the Test arena he is still figuring out whether to bat at the top or in the middle-order. Sometimes, he doesn’t have a choice. He is moved up and down because somebody isn’t available and he has to be accommodated, even if it means he has to keep wickets.
In ODIs, there is little to no doubt that he is amongst the first names in the teamsheet, for multiple reasons, where he is amongst those players who has shown flexibility like no other. Take this Champions Trophy for instance, with no third opener in the squad, if one of Rohit Sharma or Shubman Gill were to be unavailable, India just need to look at Rahul. Then in the middle-order, he can be used as a floater. In the lead up to the 2023 World Cup, when India embraced a new intent-driven approach, having Rahul at No 5 gave them stability. Even if they ended up losing wickets while trying to play the aggressive brand of cricket, India knew they could fall back on Rahul. With 1299 runs in 31 innings at an incredible average of 56.47 (which is higher than even MS Dhoni) as No 5, he owned that spot.
Now, since Gambhir came on board as head coach, Rahul’s ODI career has taken another new path. With India not having any left-handers in the top 4, and Gambhir being a huge advocate of keeping a left-right combo going in the middle, one of them had to be moved around. Despite having the numbers to continue batting at No 5, one that has earned the demotion has been Rahul, who since the ODIs in Sri Lanka has walked out to bat at No 6 on six occasions and once at No 5 and 7.
Batting at No 6 means, he is invariably playing the finisher’s role where there are more chances of him getting only few deliveries to leave an impact in the game. In conditions like Dubai, it is an altogether different challenge to walk in and straight away get down to finding boundaries and sixes. It is these scenarios, which haven’t arrived so far in the Champions Trophy that is making Rahul bat the way he does in the nets. Make no mistake, it has been quite an exhibition to watch him take the left foot out of the way and hit the ball anywhere between long-on or mid-wicket. He has also provided some jaw-dropping moments as well when the left foot moves across and he effortlessly lofts the ball through the off-side.
“I don’t think anyone prepares for an ideal scenario. All of us prepare for a realistic scenario that we might walk in,” Rahul said last week about his approach in the nets.
He would then go on to elaborate. “I’ve moved from number five to number six and sometimes to number seven. So, I realized I need to have that skill to hit sixes probably from ball one or sometimes be able to play with a really high strike rate. So that’s why you see me practicing all of that,” he said.
So far in this Champions Trophy, he has batted on three occasions, out of which two have been chases. Against New Zealand, when India batted first, he came to bat in the 30th over, but got out in the 40th over. However in two tricky chases, it has been his calmness and ability to play those high-risk shots under pressure that has helped him to take India across the line by staying unbeaten. In the first match against Bangladesh, where he remained unbeaten on 41, he scored just one boundary and two sixes. Against Australia in the semi-finals, with Kohli dropping anchor after the loss of Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel, when Rahul walked India were still 87 runs away with 15 overs to go.
So for 17 deliveries he faced, Rahul kept working the angles, but the moment the asking rate went over 6 runs an over, he walloped Tanveer Sangha and Ben Dwarshuis for boundaries in successive overs before hitting Adam Zampa for a straight-six despite long-on and long-off in place. And once Kohli fell, and Pandya came in,  he went back to deal in singles and twos before finishing the game with a six. It isn’t easy being Rahul, but then it’s a state he is intimate with all through his career.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025, leading run-scorers list: Virat Kohli jumps to 3rd spot after semi-final knock against Australia

ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Leading run-scorers: The Champions Trophy 2025 edition is drawing towards a close after India beat Australia to qualify for the final, to be held on Sunday in Dubai. South Africa compete with New Zealand for the second spot in the final during their clash in Lahore on Wednesday.
With run-scoring varying across conditions at venues in Pakistan and the UAE, senior batters from every team in contention have put their hand up for the job on the big day. India’s superstar batter Virat Kohli led a daunting 265-run chase against Australia in the semi-final with aplomb, scoring 84 off 98 deliveries on the back of his century against Pakistan during the league stage.
With 217 runs in four innings, Kohli is third on the batting charts of the tournament, with Englishmen Ben Duckett and Joe Root ahead of him with 227 and 225 runs respectively. Kohli also sprang to the second spot on the all-time run-getters charts in the Champions Trophy on Tuesday, surpassing Mahela Jayawardena and Shikhar Dhawan to reach 746 runs.
Kohli’s best campaign was in the 2017 CT edition in England where he scored 258 runs in five innings. Overall, West Indies powerhouse Chris Gayle holds the record for most runs in a Champions Trophy edition, having racked up 474 runs in eight innings in 2006.

Title: Champions Trophy: ‘India have got the best chaser in the history of the game in Virat Kohli,’ says Nasser Hussain

With Virat Kohli hitting his 74th half-century in India’s win over Australia in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy in Dubai, the 36-year-old made sure that India scored its fourth win over Australia in knockouts in ICC ODI tournaments. Kohli also crossed the 8,000-run mark in ODI run chases and took 159 innings to achieve the feat, which has only been matched by Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar. Former England captain Nasser Hussain has termed Kohli as the best run-chaser in the history of the game.
“It was a pretty clinical run chase. They have got the best chaser in the history of the game. Virat Kohli. And around Kohli, they have so much talent all the way through. Spin bowling all rounders. Guys that go hard at the ball in the power play. A wicket keeping batter in KL Rahul. That’s magnificent and an all-rounder in Hardik Pandya makes things easy,” Hussain told Sky Sports Cricket post the game.
While India won the match by four wickets, Kohli missed in what could be his 29th ODI hundred while batting second. He tried to hit an Adam Zampa googly for a six before he was caught at mid-on by Ben Dwarshuis. The Indian batsman now holds the record for the most number of 50-plus scores (24) in ICC tournaments after surpassing Tendulkar’s mark of 23 such innings.
Kohli took 53 innings to achieve the feat while Tendulkar’s 23 fifty-plus scores had come in 58 innings. Former England captain Michael Atherton too showered praise on Kohli. “You just expect him to get a 100 in a run chase like this. Once he’s got himself in you beautifully. He gave that one chance that he got away with but his manipulation of the ball today was outstanding. In fact, funnily enough, that early shot he played one of them against New Zealand as well he is quite prepared to take it on. Early but then when he gets in. He is really an expert of just knocking the ball around and finding the gaps with the precision expected. He was going to get the hundred because that’s what he does all the time in a run chase.  It would have been his 29th  ODI hundred. And then he just holed out. But that’s fine,” Atherton told Sky Sports Cricket.
KL Rahul played a knock of 42 runs and took India home with 1.5 overs to spare. Atherton sees Rahul’s experience as a strength for the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team. “He is a pretty experienced player now. Isn’t he? Obviously. He is keeping an outstanding player Rishabh Pant out of the team. Maybe that’s part of the reason for it that he is vastly experienced and he’s got a lot of skill in different ways and as Nasser rightly said he started just in Kohli’s slipstream and then just after drinks, decided that it’s my turn now, my time to take the game on. He has the ability to play in different ways. Most of these are good players and have the ability and range to do what they can. He just started off just in Kohli’s slipstream and then just after drinks decided well it’s my turn now my time to take the game on and he has the ability to play in different ways. Most of these good players have the ability and have the range to do so,” said Atherton.

Title: Wasim Akram hails chase master Virat Kohli: ‘He is definitely going to…’

Content:
With his knock of 84 runs in India’s four-wicket win over Australia in the Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday, Virat Kohli became only the second batsman in the world to cross the 8,000-run mark in ODI run chases. Sachin Tendulkar currently sits at the top of the list with 8,720 runs in ODI run chases. Former Pakistan pacer and captain Wasim Akram believes Kohli’s record is phenomenal and he is one of the greats of the game. The top five ODI run-chase scorers in world cricket are Tendulkar, Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Sanath Jayasuriya and Jacques Kallis.
“Look at these all names with the highest run chasers. Sachin, Rohit, Jayasuriya and Kallis. There are the greats of the game and Kohli is definitely going to pass Sachin Tendulkar the way it looks like. Kohli’s average is only second to MS Dhoni. Dhoni got close to 100 and Kohli’s average is close to 90. That’s just phenomenal,” Akram said during the show The Pavillion on Ten Sports.
While India scored their fourth win against Australia in the knockouts of ICC ODI tournaments on Tuesday, Australia suffered their first loss in knockouts of the ICC Tournament in ODI format with their last such loss coming in the quarter-final of the 2011 World Cup.
Australia was playing with rookie pacers Nathan Ellis and Ben Dwarshuis and were looking set to get a score in excess of 300 runs with the team placed at 198 for 4 with 14.4 overs left in their innings. Akram saw the fall of wickets of Steve Smith and Glen Maxwell in succession as the key factor in Australia’s loss resulting in a below-par score by the world champions. “If they are not here, it’s not a valid point to discuss their absence. But then they are the leading bowlers of the cricketing world. Josh Hazelwood, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins could not come, two were injured and one did not come due to personal reasons. But Australia did not help their cause. Like Steve Smith said, if the score was 290-300, then they would have got a chance. These two wickets of Smith and Maxwell made them score a below-par score,” said Akram.
Akram’s compatriot and former team-mate Waqar Younis too echoed the same thoughts. “When you have weak bowling, you need 25-30 runs extra than the par score. Like Wasim bhai said, Australia could not achieve that and it hampered them. The kind of position they were in, if Glen Maxwell would not have played that shot, things would have been different. Maxwell and Pandya are in a way similar and I would not say hit and miss. But they both can even score a 200 on their day. Also Australia did jot take their chances in the field,” said Younis.

Title: ‘Playing only in Dubai definitely helped us’: Mohammed Shami after India’s Champions Trophy semi-final win
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-dubai-advantage-help-champions-trophy-mohammed-shami-9869687/
Content:
Following his team’s Champions Trophy semi-final win over Australia in Dubai on Tuesday, India seamer Mohammed Shami said they benefitted from playing at only one venue in the eight-team tournament. Shami, who opened the campaign with a five-wicket haul against Bangaldesh, was the pick of the bowlers for India in the semi-final against Australia as he snapped three wickets (3/48) in his 10 overs against Steve Smith’s side.
While several cricketers from other teams have raised the question of India’s unfair leverage in playing their games only at the UAE venue due to the sour geo-political relations with tournament hosts Pakistan, team India captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir had downplayed the critics.
The veteran Shami, however, suggested otherwise.
“It definitely helped us because we know the conditions and the behaviour of the pitch,” Shami said on Tuesday after his pivotal role in beating Australia.
“It is a plus point that you are playing all the matches at one venue,” added Shami with India holding an unbeaten record in Dubai, winning nine of the 10 matches they have played besides a tie.
As part of the hybrid arrangement of the tournament, South Africa were forced to travel to Dubai, only to return to Pakistan again less than 24 hours later without playing a game.
Coach Gambhir would later lambast critics for their undue advantage remark on India’s Dubai camping.
“There’s a lot of debate about the undue advantage and all that. What undue advantage? We haven’t practiced here even for a day. We’re practicing at the ICC Academy. And the conditions there and here are 180 degrees different. If you look at the wickets there and here, the difference is between the ground and the sky. Some people are just perpetual cribbers, man. They’ve got to grow up. So, I feel that there was nothing like we had any undue advantage or we had planned something like that,” Gambhir said.

Title: Why Mohammed Shami is appealing to ICC to allow use of saliva on the cricket ball again

Content:
On the comeback trail from a long injury lay-off, Mohammed Shami returned to the routine of picking wickets for India during the Champions Trophy semi-final against Australia in Dubai on Tuesday.
Still far out from his regular rhythm, Shami snared three wickets nevertheless as India held Australia to 264 in the afternoon before waltzing to a four-wicket win, equalling their highest Champions Trophy chase and the biggest against Australia in an ICC knockout game.
Shami, however, rued the absence of reverse swing and said he is pleading to the global regulators at the International Cricket Council to lift the ban on the use of saliva to shine the cricket ball. The ban on applying saliva on the ball was introduced in 2022, shortly before cricket’s full-fledged return after the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Using saliva to shine one side of a used ball helps pacers generate reverse swing with the rough side in the later stages of a 50-over contest.
However, players can still use their body sweat to offer some shine on the ball.
“We are trying to reverse, but you are not getting the use of saliva into the game,” Shami told reporters after India’s win over Australia.
“We are constantly appealing to allow the use of saliva and it will be interesting with the reverse swing.”
The 34-year-old Shami, who opened the tournament with a five-wicket haul against Bangladesh and endured a brief injury concern in the game against Pakistan, said that he is still aiming to return to his best shape.
“I am trying to get my rhythm back and contribute more for the team,” said Shami. “I am ready to bowl long spells.”
Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir hailed Shami as “a world-class performer”.
“He’s phenomenal and the hunger he brings on the table, the way he trains, the way he practises — that’s why you see all those results.”

Title: Steve Smith retires from ODIs after Champions Trophy semi-final ouster at hands of India

Content:
Steve Smith has announced his retirement from One Day International Cricket after top-scoring in Australia’s ICC Champions Trophy semi-final defeat against India in Dubai on Tuesday.
Smith told teammates after the match he would retire from ODI cricket immediately. According to a statement released by Cricket Australia, Smith will continue to be available for Tests and T20Is.
After making his debut against the West Indies in 2010 as a spin-bowling all-rounder, Smith went on to play 170 ODIs scoring 5800 runs at 43.28 including 12 centuries and 35 half centuries and took 28 wickets at 34.67. A member of Australia’s 2015 and 2023 ICC World Cup winning teams, Smith became ODI captain in 2015 and held the captaincy in his final match on an interim basis in the absence of injured Pat Cummins during the Champions Trophy.
Smith set up the semi-final against India in Dubai after he opted to bat first on a dry pitch. Steering Australia on a tacky pitch, Smith made 73 off 96 deliveries as Australia set a 265-run target that India eventually overhauled to reach their third successive Champions Trophy final.
“It has been a great ride and I have loved every minute of it,” Smith said.
“There have been so many amazing times and wonderful memories. Winning two World Cups was a great highlight along with the many fantastic team-mates who shared the journey.
“Now is a great opportunity for people to start preparing for the 2027 World Cup so it feels like the right time to make way.
“Test cricket remains a priority and I am really looking forward to the World Test Championship Final, the West Indies in the winter and then England at home. I feel I still have a lot to contribute on that stage.”
Smith was Australian Men’s ODI Player of the Year in 2015 and 2021 and a member of the ICC Men’s ODI Team of the Year in 2015.

Title: WATCH: ‘Aap dono baatein karo, tab tak main…’ – Ravindra Jadeja interrupts Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul for wasting time during his over

Ravindra Jadeja’s quirkiness and snappy presence at the bowling crease can often put the opposition batters off-guard as the left-arm spinner skims through his overs within a minute. But during the Champions Trophy semi-final against Australia in Dubai on Tuesday, Jadeja even puzzled his captain Rohit Sharma and wicket-keeper KL Rahul in the middle of a bowling over.
Jadeja was interrupted during an over when captain Rohit Sharma got into a chat with Rahul, pondering whether to include a first slip for the turning ball. When Rahul responded in the negative, insisting that there wasn’t much turn on offer, Jadeja hilariously stepped in and halted the chatter.
The conversation went as:
KL Rahul: Nahi jaa raha itna (It’s not turning much).
Rohit Sharma from cover: Bhai, teen ball hain. Slip le le. Kya pata nikal jaaye. (Take a slip. Three balls are left. One may spin).
KL Rahul to Rohit: Ek ball ghooma hai ab tak, bas (Only one ball has turned thus far).
Ravindra Jadeja: Aap dono baatein karo, main tab tak teen ball daal deta hu. (You guys keep talking, and in the meantime, I’ll bowl the remaining three deliveries).
Jab tak baat hogi, ek aur over hojayegi! 🤣

Jadeja’s bowling entry would eventually prove to be crucial for India as he broke a progressing partnership between Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, trapping the latter lbw. Jadeja (2/40) followed up to dismiss Josh Inglis and emerge as India’s second-best wicket-taker in the match behind Mohammed Shami.
“The wicket was better than the last game, not much spin. We need to start well. If we play sensible cricket in the first 10 overs, then there won’t be any issues. Smith and Labuschagne were batting nicely, and I tried to attack the stumps. Luckily, we were able to contain the runs and picked a few wickets as well,” said Jadeja after Australia were bundled for 264 before India romped home to a four-wicket win.

Title: Angry Gautam Gambhir blasts critics on India’s Dubai advantage: ‘Some people are just perpetual cribbers, man, grow up’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/angry-gautam-gambhir-india-champions-trophy-dubai-advantage-9869337/
Content:
A day after captain Rohit Sharma dismissed any talks of India being at home in Dubai and familiar with the conditions, it was the turn of their head coach Gautam Gambhir to drive home the point even when he was not questioned about it. Speaking shortly after the four-wicket win over Australia, Gambhir was not only assertive but also typically pugnacious with most of the questions put forward.
Right through the tournament which Pakistan are hosting, there have been several criticisms directed at the advantage India have gained by playing all their matches in Dubai. Now with India making it to the final, all those talks aren’t going to die down and Gambhir, who seemed bothered about it, weighed in with his thoughts in his own way.
“There’s a lot of debate about the undue advantage and all that. What undue advantage? We haven’t practiced here even for a day. We’re practicing at the ICC Academy. And the conditions there and here are 180 degrees different. If you look at the wickets there and here, the difference is between the ground and the sky. Some people are just perpetual cribbers, man. They’ve got to grow up. So, I feel that there was nothing like we had any undue advantage or we had planned something like that,” Gambhir said.
Though Australia captain Steve Smith — who spoke before Gambhir — refused to buy into the advantage argument that India were getting, former England players Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain have been critical of it. Even New Zealand, who played here on Sunday and could possibly return for the final, have downplayed all such talks.

Gambhir was then asked if India knew the conditions would be spinner-friendly in Dubai when they picked five spin bowling options, which again didn’t sit well with him.
““First of all, this is as neutral a venue for us as it is for any other team. We have not played here. I don’t remember which tournament we played in this stadium last. And in fact, we didn’t plan anything like that. The plan was that if you pick two front-line spinners in the 15-man squad, then even if we played in Pakistan or anywhere, we would have picked two front-line spinners because it was a competition on the subcontinent. So, it was nothing like we wanted to set up a spinners’ trap. If you look at it, we only played one frontline spinner in the first three matches. We only played two frontline spinners in this match or the previous match. So, it was nothing like that,” Gambhir said.
From the moment India picked five spinners there have been several questions as to whether they picked one too many. There has also been criticism over the decision to demote KL Rahul from No 5 to 6 even as Rishabh Pant continues to warm the bench. With India now in the final, Gambhir was asked if all his decisions now seem vindicated.
“KL averages 50 in one day cricket, that’s the answer,” he would say before adding, “I don’t care about it (criticism). I don’t even care about it honestly. My job is to be honest to 140 crore Indians and to my players in the dressing room. I don’t care what people say about it, how they talk about it, whether they’ve got agendas, whether they’ve not got agendas, I don’t even care about it. If I’m honest to my job, that is all that matters and I can sleep in peace.”
“And when you talk about the spinning combination we’ve got three all-rounders in those five spinners. I don’t know why people keep forgetting about it and those three all-rounders are quality all-rounders. Actually, in the entire squad we’ve only picked two front line spinners and that is okay in a 15-member squad if you pick two front line spinners that’s not too much to be asking for,” Gambhir said.
With four wins out four in as many different pitches, India despite being tested by tough conditions have put up a strong show, ticking all their boxes. As one of New Zealand and South Africa await in the final on Sunday, Gambhir said there is still scope for improvement.
“See, in international sport, you want to keep improving. You don’t say that you’ve ticked all the boxes. There’s always room to improve. There’s always something to improve, be it in batting, fielding, or bowling. And we still haven’t played a perfect game. We still have one more game to go. Hopefully we can play a perfect game. And that is the kind of person I am. I will never be satisfied with the performances. We want to keep improving, we want to stay humble, we want to be ruthless on the cricket field but absolutely humble off the field as well. That’s the kind of team environment and that’s the kind of culture we want to create in that dressing room and be absolutely honest. So hopefully we can play one more game and play our best game.”

Title: ‘Sometimes I’m sitting there thinking what more can I do’: KL Rahul on his stop-start middle-order role in ODIs

Content:
Despite establishing himself as one of the most consistent ODI batters at No. 5 and taking up the wicket-keeping gloves regularly since 2020, KL Rahul’s role in the spot has often been scrutinised.
Dropped a rung lower to No. 6 in the Champions Trophy, with left-hander Axar Patel promoted up the order, Rahul applied his wares adeptly on Tuesday in the semi-final against Australia. The 32-year-old befittingly hit the winning runs, smashing Glenn Maxwell for a six over long-on in the penultimate over to seal a 265-run chase and a four-wicket victory for India to reach their fifth Champions Trophy final and a third in successio.
“Yeah, I do [enjoy batting at the top], I mean I won’t lie,” Rahul told Star Sports after the game. “It’s after opening the batting in Australia in Test matches and having to face that attack in Australia and you know how red-ball [cricket] is much harder. I opened the batting there and then to come here and bat low seems a bit different, but this is how I’ve played white-ball cricket in the last four-five years.
“So, I’m quite used to going up and down the order so I’m just happy getting a chance to play in the middle and whatever role is given, I think it’s really helped me understand my game a lot more and I’ve had to work on boundary hitting a lot more in the last year or so because the last ODI we played in Sri Lanka I batted at No. 6, so I knew that’s where I’ll be batting and [we] needed a left-hander in the top order.”

Rahul admitted that he could not help but wonder what more could he have done to cement a stable position in the middle-order over the last few years. Since 2020, Rahul is one of five ODI batters to aggregate at least 1000 runs at No. 5, with the Karnataka batter’s 58.72 average ranking the highest. The runs have come at a decent clip too with Rahul striking at 96.41, only bettered by South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen (126.11).
“Honestly, I mean it’s since 2020 I’ve batted at No.5 and a lot of times people forget that that’s where I’ve been batting,” Rahul said. “And every time I perform in a series and then there’s a break from ODI series, ODI cricket and then we come back after four or five months there’s a question mark again about, ‘oh well will he play in the XI, where does he fit?’ and sometimes I’m sitting there thinking what more can I do. Everywhere that I’ve been asked to play I’ve played and I feel like I have performed my role,” remarked Rahul.
Rahul, however, acknowledged captain Rohit Sharma who has backed him as the lead wicket-keeper in the format. “Whatever’s been told to me by Rohit, Rohit’s been the captain for the last four-five years. And whatever he’s told me I feel like I’ve done that to the best of my ability. And I know that Rohit feels the same and he’s always supported me and backed me with that. So, there’s that confidence going into game that the captain has my back.”

SA vs NZ Semi-Final Champions Trophy 2025 Gaddafi Stadium Pitch Report And Lahore Weather Forecast Updates: Mitchell Santner’s South Africa will lock horns with Temba Bavuma’s South Africa in the second semi-final of the Champions Trophy 2025 at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Wednesday. While the Kiwis will be aiming for their first CT final since 2009, South Africa last made it to the summit clash in the inaugural edition, in 1998.  South Africa are unbeaten in the tournament with a washout against Australia in between their wins against Afghanistan and England. Meanwhile, New Zealand, who entered the tournament after winning the Tri-Series and beating Bangladesh and Pakistan, lost to India in the last league-stage match. With India’s spin combine troubling them, the Black Caps will be aiming to regroup in conditions that better suit their style in Lahore.
Pitch report
In the two full games hosted in the competition, the Gaddafi Stadium has provided surfaces conducive for batting. In the first game at the venue, Australia chased down a mammoth 351 against England and in the second game where Afghanistan met England over 600 runs were scored overall. The pitch is likely to retain those traits for the semifinal contest.
Weather report
According to the Accuweather app, there is a clear and sunny day expected in Lahore, unlike the previous rain-marred league-stage outing between Afghanistan and Australia. The temperature is to stay around 20 degrees centigrade throughout the day.

SA vs NZ Playing 11 Today Match, Semi-Final Champions Trophy 2025: With India waiting in the final, South Africa and New Zealand will lock horns in Lahore top see who joins them in the summit clash in Dubai. The Proteas remain unbeaten in the tournament with 2 wins while New Zealand’s perfect record was blighted by India in the last Group A clash on Sunday.
South Africa might have an edge in the match with their deep batting lineup expected to fire in the high-scoring Lahore pitch. New Zealand, meanwhile, will have to adjust to the Pakistan pitches after playing on the sluggish Dubai surface against India last week.
South Africa had been sweating over the fitness of Aiden Markram who had injured his right hamstring against England last week. They had also George Linde as a cover for the injured star but in a big relief for the Proteas camp, Markram was declared fit and available for selection for the crucial encounter against the Kiwis.
New Zealand might opt for a single change from their match against India and draft in Nathan Smith for Kyle Jamieson. Due to the match being played in a high-scoring venue, Smith who is a decent hand with the bat might get the nod over Jamieson.

South Africa: Ryan Rickelton, Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), David Miller, Marco Jansen, George Linde, Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi

South Africa need 189 runs from 20 overs to win the second semi-final in the Champions Trophy against New Zealand. But the Proteas have lost four wickets already, including the set batters Rassie van der Dussen (69) and Temba Bavuma (56).
Spurred by centuries from Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson, New Zealand smashed the record for the team total in Champions Trophy history when they posted 362/6 in Lahore on Wednesday. Besides the two centurions, the Black Caps were also buoyed by Glenn Phillips (unbeaten 49) and Daryl Mitchell (49). The winner of the contest faces off against India, who defeated Australia by four wickets in Dubai on Tuesday.
The two teams met each other just this past month in an ODI, that too at the same venue as part of the tri-series involving Pakistan. New Zealand had won that game by six wickets with eight balls remaining. But it must be pointed out that the Proteas side which lost to the Black Caps last month is very different from the current team: of that squad of 13, only Temba Bavuma, Heinrich Klaasen, Wiaan Mulder and Keshav Maharaj are in the Champions Trophy 15-player squad.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Amidst speculation about his future, Virat Kohli shows what makes him a chase-master in ODIs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-virat-kohli-chase-master-future-speculation-9868931/
Content:
Where would India be without Virat Kohli in this ICC Champions Trophy? As they got one step closer to becoming the most successful team in the tournament’s history, for the second time in this edition, Kohli mastered a chase.
Unlike the game against Pakistan where he remained unbeaten on 100, there was no century to show against Australia in Tuesday’s semi-final. But his 84 was an innings that sent a strong reminder to the world that Kohli isn’t going anywhere for now. If anything, with such knocks under pressure in the most challenging of conditions, he seems to be indicating a second wind in his career.
Truth be told, Kohli looked all over the place in the first game against Bangladesh, who were able to pin him to the crease. After that knock, he trained for extra hours at the nets, facing local spin bowlers and in the sessions that followed, has been testing himself against the tweakers in the India squad. Before facing them, he would check what sort of field setting they are bowling to and find ways to evade those imaginary fielders. If he believed the gap was found, he would bring out his fist- pump or have a word or two with the bowlers.


A post shared by ICC (@icc)
So it isn’t surprising he has been able to do the same in the middle. Against Australia, having lost both openers, and chasing the highest target so far in the Dubai leg of the tournament, he had to ensure the asking rate didn’t climb. Never mind the nature of the attack, it still was a steep ask on this pitch, where even one wicket can completely change the course of a game.
Yet, Kohli managed to do it, getting to his 50 off just 53 deliveries with four boundaries. In all he had 56 singles and four twos as he got the job done by playing the sort of innings needed on this pitch.
“It was pretty similar to the other day against Pakistan. There were about seven fours when I got a hundred. For me, it’s about just understanding the conditions, preparing my game accordingly, just rotating strike. Because partnerships on this pitch are the most important thing and my only effort that day and today was to string in enough partnerships,” Kohli told the broadcaster after the game.
What Kohli has also been able to do is dictate the tempo of the chase, where even a sequence of dot deliveries can quickly bring pressure on batting teams. So far, he hasn’t played a shot out of desperation, a clear sign of how he has managed to overcome the conditions by trusting his game that has brought him 28 centuries in chases, out of which 24 have come in wins.
Off the 98 deliveries he faced on Tuesday, there were just 33 dot balls. Once he passed 50, Kohli had to slow down as India lost Shreyas Iyer. But at no stage did he try to do anything different, instead sticking to risk-free cricket.
“Timing and composure at the crease. I wasn’t feeling desperate,” Kohli would say about the facet of his batting that stood out. “I was pretty happy knocking ones around. When, as a batsman, you start taking pride in hitting those singles into the gaps, that’s when you know you’re playing good cricket. You know you’re in for a big partnership and settle the nerves down a little bit and head towards chasing the total down. That, in the game against Pakistan and today, was the most pleasing factor for me,” he added.
Australia captain Steve Smith would explain what set Kohli apart in chases like this. “He’s arguably the best chaser the game has seen. He’s done it numerous times against us. He controls the tempo of the game really well, plays to his strengths and takes the game deep. I thought he played really well again tonight.”
Having come into the tournament under pressure, with speculation about his future being on the line, the nature of the surfaces that have been on offer in Dubai is the last thing a batsman aspiring to find form and runs would have wanted. None of the four pitches that India have played on is one where batsmen can find fluency. Unless a batsman is able to assess the conditions to a T as quickly as possible, it is impossible to feel settled here. But among all the Indian batsmen on this trip, it is Kohli who has looked in complete control of the game, irrespective of the situation.

“He’s a phenomenal one-day cricketer. He knows how to adapt to conditions very quickly. That’s why experience and high-quality players are very important. That’s why he has got that kind of record in one-dayers. I hope he continues that in the future as well,” head coach Gautam Gambhir said.

Title: Heinrich Klaasen: ‘Strong man with pure technique’, a dangerous power-hitting machine who can clear boundaries at will
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/heinrich-klaasen-strong-man-pure-technique-champions-trophy-9868918/
Content:
Jofra Archer might well have been wondering what he could have done differently when a couple of good-length deliveries were caressed through the off-side by Heinrich Klaasen for boundaries. There was nothing wrong with the deliveries; it was fast bowling manual 1-0-1 where Archer hit the top of the off-stump, but they were just not enough to contain Klaasen.
South Africa will be facing New Zealand in the second semifinal of the Champions Trophy. The Kiwi attack, along with some skilful new-ball bowlers, also possess some canny accurate finger spinners who have troubled the batting line-ups in this tournament thus far. For South Africa to have an edge in the middle overs, Klaasen’s ability to hit good balls for boundaries will be the key.
”He’s a strong man but also backs it up with pure technique so he’s developed his game. He now has maybe some more options than other players but it comes through hard work. And also in recognising what his strengths are and how best to use them at the right time,” Sunrisers Hyderabad assistant coach Simon Helmot tells The Indian Express.
The big shots aren’t down to blind swinging but down to technique, says Helmot. “It comes from good strength, a good core and then uncoiling. The big muscles to the smaller muscles, that’s what good power hitters do. He has a very simple swing; it’s very balanced and one where he has complete control. When some batters try to swing and hit big, they can lose their shape and their balance.  Where Klaasen actually keeps his shape, keeps his balance, produces a full face with the bat and that’s where he’s able to hit both strongly over the offside and the on- side,” Helmot says.
Not only is Klaasen a prolific boundary-hitter but is also very consistent in closing out the games and not just mere cameos, which might be needed in Lahore on Wednesday, as it has been the best batting strip in the tournament.
“Whether it’s setting a target or chasing, he stays in the moment; that’s where he’s continued to grow and develop as a batter. To stay mindful in the moment and play each ball on its merits and not overplay the situation. I think that’s where he’s been excellent for the Sunrises, no doubt he’s been excellent for his country and that’s why he can be so impactful, especially in the middle and back end of innings,” says Helmot.
“I think he tries to take matches as deeply as possible and obviously the match situation may dictate what that looks like, run rate and pressure may dictate how early or how late he may need to press the accelerator, he remains completely focused on whatever the task may be but such a good team man, it’s not just him, he takes a lot of emphasis on working with his teammates and making good partnerships to ensure that his teams can produce match winning totals,” Helmot would add.
What are the odds of a team at 120/3 after 25.1 overs and ending up with 416/5 after 50 overs? Unlikely to impossible might be the answer; however, Klaasen pulled it off sensationally against Australia with his 84-ball 174 in September 2023. And it’s not been an one-off.
Helmot nails the requisite character that helps Klaasen pull off these heists. “It needs tremendous skill and strength from within. It’s a combination of both, isn’t it?  It can’t come off all the time, but often it has with Klaas. I think that’s just because he has some great self-belief and confidence. That’s come through sheer hard work and many ups and downs over his journey. Now, he finds himself in a place where he’s able to succeed both individually and, most importantly, for his team.”

Title: IND vs AUS: Virat Kohli aced a chase, but here’s how India’s supporting cast chipped in
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-aus-virat-kohli-hardik-rahul-axar-shreyas-champions-trophy-9868904/
Content:
While Steve Smith rued the fact that Australia didn’t have enough significant partnerships, India found one between Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer, which yielded 91. It was a testament to Iyer’s form in the middle order and how he has owned the No.4 spot in this format. While he wasn’t at his attacking best, he kept the strike rotating.
It might not appear significant in the end result, but Axar Patel at No. 5 once again played a handy knock. With Kohli surviving a dropped chance and Iyer dismissed immediately thereafter, Patel walked out and played an important cameo. A slog-sweep for six and a gorgeous four over cover were standout shots on the night. He continues to impress in all three facets of the game.
At the 40-over mark, with the required rate creeping up, Nasser Hussain picked up a cue on air, watching KL Rahul’s body language. He sensed that there was an acceleration around the corner and Rahul did just that. He later told the broadcasters that, contrary to how Kohli batted, he found it tough to rotate strike, so decided to go for boundaries. He finished the match off with a six, and a confidence-boosting 42* off 34.

According to Rahul, Hardik Pandya walked in at the fall of Kohli’s wicket and said that he will take on Adam Zampa, because it was a good match-up for him. When he played out a few dot balls, some nerves were visible in the India supporters. But after smashing Tanveer Sangha into the stands, he went after Zampa for consecutive sixes. The 14 dots didn’t seem a big deal then, and by the time he was out, Pandya had put the match beyond Australia.

Title: Run, Virat run: Kohli’s incredible stats for singles taken sums up knock against Australia

Virat Kohli masterminded yet another chase for India taking down the target of 265 set by Australia in the semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 on Tuesday.
Coming early in the fifth over after Shubman Gill fell early to Ben Dwarshuis, Kohli scored 84 runs in 98 balls with five fours and got out in the 43rd over with the team in a comfortable position. India chased down the target in the 49th over with KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja guiding the team to the final.
Known for his impeccable approach during run chases, Virat focused on rotating the strike during the middle overs against Australia spinners Adam Zampa, Cooper Connolly, and Tanveer Sangha.
Kohli took 56 singles in his innings, which made up 67% of his total score of 84. He played 33 dot balls from the 98 balls he played, scoring on 65 balls. He was involved in three major partnerships: Shreyas Iyer (91 runs from 111 balls), Axar Patel (44 runs from 52 balls), and KL Rahul (47 runs from 46 balls).
Incredibly, as per the statistic showed by the broadcast, with 56 singles Kohli extended his lead for taking the most runs via ones in ODIs since January 2000. He tops the list with 5,870 singles followed by Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka with 5,688.
The chase was built on the strike rotation during the middle overs against the spinners as Kohli led from the front.
Kohli scored 84 runs in 98 balls with 56 singles, 4 doubles, and 5 fours. He took 47 singles in the middle overs (11-40 overs), five singles in the first powerplay (1-10 overs), and four singles in the last powerplay before getting dismissed.
Kohli and Iyer: After Rohit Sharma got out to Connolly in the 8th over, Kohli along with Iyer stitched a 91-run partnership for the third wicket. It was a hard-working partnership with both players running a total of 51 singles (Kohli 24 and Shreyas 27) in the 111-ball partnership constantly rotating the strike.
Kohli and Axar: For the fourth-wicket partnership, Kohli and Axar made 44 runs in 52 balls. The duo ran a total of 24 singles with Kohli (13 singles) rotating the strike and Axar scoring a couple of crucial boundaries.
Kohli and Rahul: KL Rahul and Kohli stitched a total of 47 runs in 46 balls with Kohli again taking the anchor role and rotating the strike while Rahul went after the bowlers hitting two fours and one six.

Title: How a batting masterclass by Virat Kohli and sharp bowling helped India enter the Champions Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/batting-masterclass-virat-kohli-sharp-bowling-india-champions-trophy-9868835/
Content:
With each outing, India are getting stronger and stronger. Unless New Zealand and South Africa, whoever flies down to Dubai after winning the second semi-final at Lahore on Wednesday, comes up with an exceptional performance, it is hard to stop India from laying hands on the Champions Trophy.
Like the MS Dhoni-led side that brushed aside every opponent in the United Kingdom to win the title unbeaten in 2013, this Rohit Sharma’s side is on the way to repeating history in the UAE. And they are doing it in some style too. With a spin-attack that is the envy of every opponent and a batting unit that is oozing class on testing conditions, India continue to roll. On Tuesday, it was the turn of world champions Australia to suffer a 5-wicket defeat at the hands of India.
Chasing a tricky target of 265 for a place in their third successive Champions Trophy final, it needed an
extraordinary effort with the bat. And Virat Kohli provided one to deny Australia another opportunity to hold on to the World Cup and Champions Trophy at the same time. It was a night, where Kohli first calmed the nerves in the dressing room by being compact at the start when they lost both Shubman Gill and Rohit Sharma inside eight overs and then went on to dictate the tempo of the chase with his risk-free batting before falling for 84 having taken India within 40 runs of the target. That dismissal once again gave an opening for Australia, but KL Rahul’s unbeaten 42 and Hardik Pandya’s cameo shut the door firmly on them by taking India home with 11 balls to spare.
When Cooper Connolly, with his part-time left-arm spin, trapped Rohit Sharma, despite having an attack that is thin on experience and lacking bite to cause any pain, Australia would have fancied their chances. With 264 to defend, which was already the highest any team had posted in the Dubai leg, another wicket or two would have rattled India. Though this pitch was more conducive to batting than the previous three strips that were used, to keep pace with the asking rate on this was fraught with risk.
Kohli in the company of Shreyas Iyer stitched 91-runs for the third wicket that brought India back in the chase. For a team that is without the pace trio of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, the expectations have been low. Just weeks before the tournament, Marcus Stoinis announced retirement from the format.
There is not a single travelling Australian journalist at the tournament. At Dubai to overcome a strong Indian side, they packed their XI with five spin bowling options. However, with the exception of leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who took the wickets of Shreyas and Kohli, the rest of them hardly posed any threat. It meant, once Kohli decided to cut down any shot that brought risk and Shreyas showed his dominant side, India were in cruise control.
VENKATA KRISHNA B WRITES FROM DUBAI: In Champions Trophy semis, Chase General Virat Kohli conquers Australia, leads India’s march to final
What delayed the inevitable was the self-destruction, first from Shreyas then from Axar Patel and Kohli himself. If Shreyas’s innings was cut short at 45 by an expansive cut that he tried off Zampa, Axar perished while trying to hit Nathan Ellis across the line. The slog-sweep, which went straight to the fielder at long-on, was the lone blot on Kohli’s otherwise near flawless innings as he looked settled for his 52nd ODI century.
Having entered the game as firm favourites, India lived up to the expectations, while overcoming some hiccups on the way. Unlike their previous outing against New Zealand, where there was plenty of turn on the surface, this pitch played differently. Having stuck to the same XI, which saw them play four spinners, they had done an incredible job while bowling first to restrict Australia to 264.
Factoring in their bowling resources, Australia’s intent with the bat stood out. It was an afternoon where India had to fight hard for each wicket and had to play the patience game. That moment came in the 37th over when Steve Smith and Alex Carey were setting up Australia for a grandstand finish. Having gone at over 5 runs per over, which no team has done so far in this campaign against India, a total of 300 was in Australia’ sights. And with that intention Smith charged down at Mohammed Shami, only to miss a full-toss that dipped on him and castled the stumps.
Still with Glenn Maxwell walking in, India remained defensive, keeping large pockets open. All that Australia needed from Maxwell at that stage was a cameo that would give enough total for their bowlers to work with. Having hit Axar Patel already for a six, he would go for another expansive heave, that the other Australian batsmen had refrained from, and would end up losing his stumps. Though they would end with 264, it was India that walked away as a happier side during the break. And it showed why in the end.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘Hardik’s shots at the end were crucial’: Rohit Sharma lauds allrounder after India defeat Australia in semifinal

Content:
India skipper Rohit Sharma lauded Virat Kohli for his crucial 84-run knock against Australia while also praising the contributions of the other batters, singling out Hardik Pandya’s huge hits at the death on his way to a quick 28 runs from 24 deliveries. On the back of these performances, India defeated Australia by 4 wickets and punched their ticket to the summit clash, scheduled for Sunday in Dubai.
“Yes, he’s (Virat) done it for us for many years. We were calm during our batting innings. We wanted that big partnership, which Shreyas and Virat provided, along with smaller partnerships between Axar, Virat, KL, and Virat. And then Hardik’s shots at the end were crucial,” Rohit said after the match.
He also talked about the nature of the surface, saying that it played slightly better on Tuesday than the one that was used in the last Group game against New Zealand last week.
“It looked better, but that’s been the nature of the surfaces here; they’re very uncertain. The surface today played slightly better than the one we faced against New Zealand. Our group talks about playing good cricket, understanding the situation, and not reading too much into what the pitch does,” Rohit said.
In the match, batting first, Australia were bowled out for 264 in 49.3 overs and India chased it down with 11 balls to spare.
Besides Kohli’s 98-ball knock, Shreyas Iyer made 45 while KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya chipped in with 42 and 28 respectively in the first semifinal.
Earlier, captain Steve Smith and Alex Carey struck fifties to guide Australia past 260.
Smith top-scored with 73 off 96 balls as he stitched two crucial partnerships, first with Travis Head (39) for the second wicket, which yielded 50 runs, and then with Marnus Labuschagne (29) for the third for another 56 runs. Carey made 61.

For India, Mohammed Shami (3/38) grabbed three wickets while Varun Chakravarthy and Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets apiece.

Title: New Zealand vs South Africa: Kane Williamson explains the skill and thought behind his three best shots in whiteball cricket
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/new-zealand-vs-south-africa-kane-williamson-skill-three-best-shots-lahore-9868777/
Content:
Kane Williamson remembers the moment from the 2019 World Cup game against South Africa rather well. The equation had read 12 runs needed from seven balls, and Lungi Ngidi was in the midst of an inspiring over. A boundary was needed.
Guess what shot Williamson went for. A late cut. He let the ball come to him, arresting all urges and twitches to the contrary, and as the ball squeezed between short third man and the wicketkeeper, South African hopes sank.
It’s the kind of shot that Williamson is likely to deploy in the semifinal – the least-risk well-honed strokes that he is known for – three strokes in particular: the late cut, the back-foot punch, and the sweep.
“That shot is what comes to mind when I think about the late-cuts I played,” Williamson told The Indian Express much before the ICC Champions Trophy, where New Zealand will face South Africa in Wednesday’s semifinal. It’s not even a late-cut, the way he plays it. The master of the late cut in the 1990s, Arjuna Ranatunga took the riskier option; the bat-face would open and just before impact, it would seem the off-stump could get knocked back. Williamson has also tamed the shot.
“I play it like a dab, with as much as a vertical bat-face as possible, letting the ball do the work. (Unlike Ranatunga), my bat-lift is higher and I would bring the bat down and try to place it in line.”
It’s not known if Ranatunga’s was a natural shot, but Williamson says he certainly didn’t have it in his development years. It’s a shot he picked up in his quest to widen his repertoire, triggered by watching two modern-day South African greats.
“I remember watching AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla in my earlier years. You could see the way they were evolving their game. Forcing good-area deliveries against high-quality bowling is tougher. I watched them deflect the ball. I thought I might try and practise that. It’s a shot you are always trying to touch on in practice, make it efficient. I do recall thinking it was a nice option,” Williamson says.
A year after he downed South Africa, he would use that shot to good effect in the IPL against Royal Challengers Bangalore. The bowler was Navdeep Saini and Virat Kohli had set the field with a short third and men at extra cover suggested he was expecting an on-the-up punch. Williamson remembers that shot as well.
“It was again similar, late in the innings. It’s a good ball for a seam bowler; trying to use the pace, finer boundary option. Saini has good pace; kind of instinctive and it’s nice that it came off.”
Just like Ranatunga, Williamson also looks at that shot near the end of an innings when most others try to heave and wallop the ball.
“It’s handy at a slightly later stage as it’s a shot that’s not expected. You are looking at options, what the bowler is looking to do, what’s the field, and if the ball is there, you commit. It’s different from the start of an innings, with the ball swinging; it’s just about reading the game and using the options. I was lucky it came off.”
However, the opposition bowlers know there isn’t much luck, but pure skill and a lot of modesty.
——————————–
The second shot Williamson often deploys is the sweep against the spinners. Sometimes he shuffles to the off-side and tries to access the area behind square. South Africa have a left-arm spinner in Keshav Maharaj and the wristy one in Tabraiz Shamsi.
“It’s more timing and conditions. If it’s stopping and turning, it can be a risky decision – and I have made plenty of those. It comes back to preparation in the nets. I tend not to play it, irrespective of what the bowler is trying; it depends on the field, you factor in options, where he is bowling. It’s about reading the game rather than thinking that this is the only option I have and it has to happen. You don’t always need to play the sweep; you have to be smart.”
———————————-
Then there is that classic Williamson backfoot punch to the seamers. He doesn’t play the horizontal version, but gets close to the ball, rather lets it get close to him, and plays it very late. Sometimes he even gets both feet in the air, and still nails it.
Williamson smiles, pauses and says reflectively, “of the three shots, this one is most instinctive, I guess, for me. Most natural of the three. Because I am slightly shorter, you get up on the toes, or even higher, to counter the bounce. The trajectory is steeper for a shorter batsman like me; my options are different from a taller batsman.
“The back-foot punch also depends on the surface and type of bowler, and if the ball is coming on to the bat. Similar deliveries get run down to third man, perhaps a little shorter. It’s the same mindset behind that – the idea is to access different parts of the ground, play late and relatively with a straight bat. Use the pace, basically. It’s a shot I play in all formats. You work with what you are experiencing and sometimes you are in the air, and you are still playing close and basic,” he says.
All the three shots could come into play on a batting-friendly surface in Lahore. If they come off, New Zealand could well be the ones challenging India on a slower surface where the expertise and experience of Williamson, as he showed in the last league game, would be most valuable.

Title: IND vs AUS | Champions Trophy: Steve Smith on where Australia fell short in the semifinal against India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-aus-champions-trophy-steve-smith-reaction-9868803/
Content:
IND vs AUS Champions Trophy 2025: Australia came into the ICC Champions Trophy without some serious starpower, especially in their bowling unit. World Cup-winnning captain Pat Cummins and frontline bowlers Mitch Starc and Josh Hazlewood were absent. But it wasn’t the bowling that Smith felt was the difference between India and Australia in Dubai on Tuesday. Chasing 265, India were made to work hard on a tricky batting surface but they eventually got home with 11 balls and four wickets to spare. Speaking after the match, Smith felt Australia were a few runs short after opting to bat first.
“It wasn’t the easiest batting condition, probably why the scores were as they were. I thought we could have put a few more runs on. We lost a couple of wickets at crucial times. If we got 280 plus, things could have been different,” Smith said in the post-match chat, adding that the lack of sufficient partnerships hurt the world champions. “It always felt like we were one wicket too many down at each stage of the game. If we could have extended one of those partnerships, that’s probably where we get to 280. There would be a little more pressure on the game.”

Smith, who was the top scorer with 73, was involved in three different 50-plus partnerships (with Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, and Alex Carey) but the highest of those was 56, while India had one big stand wth Shreyas Iyer and Virat Kohli adding 91. Australia were particularly hampered by losing Smith and Maxwell back-to-back in the 37th and 38th over after which Alex Carey had to consolidate.
Smith was full of praise for an inexperienced bowling attack. “I thought the bowlers did a really good job. They worked hard throughout. The spinners squeezed and enabled us to take the game deeper than it could have gone. It was a tricky wicket for batting and tough to rotate the strike at times. I thought everyone did a really good job tonight.”

Title: Virat Kohli: ‘(Milestones) don’t matter as much anymore… only effort today was to string enough partnerships’

Virat Kohli helped guide India to the ICC Champions Trophy final with a composed 84-run knock in a chase of 265 runs against Australia on Tuesday. After India were reduced to 43/2 at one stage, losing both openers, Kohli combined with Shreyas Iyer (45 runs) to set the platform for a comfortable chase.
In the end, player of the match Kohli missed out on a century after getting caught at long on while trying to hit a maximum.
VENKATA KRISHNA B WRITES FROM DUBAI: In Champions Trophy semis, Chase General Virat Kohli conquers Australia, leads India’s march to final
Asked at the post-match press conference what aspect pleased him the most about today’s innings, Kohli said: “I think my timing and composure at the crease were key. I wasn’t feeling desperate; I was happy knocking ones around. As a batsman, you start taking pride in hitting those singles into the gaps. That’s when you know you’re playing well. You’re in for a big partnership, settle the nerves down a bit, and head towards chasing the total down. So for me, in the game against Pakistan and today, that was the most pleasing factor.”
Q: Tell us about the innings. Was it slightly unusual in that you conceived it mostly with singles?
Virat Kohli: I think it was similar to the game against Pakistan as well. It was about 7 fours when I got to 100 that day. For me, it’s about understanding the conditions, preparing my game accordingly, and rotating strike because partnerships on this pitch are crucial. My only effort that day and today was to string enough partnerships. When I got out, the plan was to get 20 more and then try to finish it off in a couple of overs. Usually, that’s the template I follow, but sometimes you can’t execute things as you want to. It’s all dependent on the conditions. The pitch dictates how the cricket needs to be played, and then I just switch on and play accordingly.
Q: You had a century in the last game and a near one today. Are you playing this format as well as you’ve ever played?
Virat Kohli: Well, I don’t know. That’s up to you guys to analyze. I’ve never focused on those things. I think I’ve spoken to you about this before. When you don’t think of those milestones, they happen along the way towards victory. For me, it’s about taking pride in doing the job for the team. If I get to the three-figure mark, great. If not, nights like these, it’s a happy dressing room. You go back, feel grateful for what happened, and then put your head down, work hard, and go all over again. That’s what I’ve done my whole career. Those things don’t matter as much anymore. For me, it’s just about stepping up and hopefully doing the job for the team.
He then pointed out that stringing partnerships was the key to chasing the target down.
“This game is about pressure, especially in big games like semis and final. If you go deep into the innings with enough wickets in hand, the opposition usually gives in, making the game easier. It’s important to control your impulses during the game. For me, knowing the number of overs and runs left is crucial. Even if it comes to needing six an over, I’m not bothered as long as we have six or seven wickets in hand. Two set batters can turn the game around, and the opposition can only get back with wickets. So that was the plan out there.”
India will await the inner of the second semi-final between South Africa and New Zealand on Wednesday.

Title: Champions Trophy: Chase General Virat Kohli conquers Australia, leads India’s march to final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-beat-australia-qualify-champions-trophy-2025-final-dubai-9868708/
Content:
With a thumping K L Rahul six over long-on, India leapt over their biggest hurdle in the 50-over ICC tournaments — Australia. The margin of victory — by four wickets and 11 balls to spare to fix the summit clash on Sunday — doesn’t capture the clinical outmuscling and outwitting of the World Champions. The victory was also the last stroke of embarrassment for Pakistan. First the host nation crashed out in humiliating fashion, and now, with India in the final, Dubai gets to host the title contest.
The chief protagonist of India’s semi-final win was Virat Kohli, who composed a familiarly scientific 84 in chase, and en route completed 8,000 runs when hunting down targets alone. But it was also a triumph of collectivism, with a resourceful ensemble cast performing their roles to perfection, so much so that their contributions were as significant as Kohli’s in the larger context of the game.
Kohli’s mastery of the ODI format has reached a stage where he now virtually bats on autopilot mode, without any undue stress. He detailed the essence of his knock that consumed 98 balls and was studded with five fours: “My timing, my composure at the crease, I wasn’t rushed. The singles that I took were the most pleasing part for me.”
While the match will be remembered for Kohli’s knock, the contributions of the support acts cannot be forgotten. Mohammed Shami bowled with precision and penetration, providing breakthroughs in critical junctures of the game. Steve Smith looked in sublime touch before the low full toss that cleaned him up and broke a 54-run stand between him and the enterprising Alex Carey.
The dismissal may appear like fortune, but it clearly was not. Smith was looking to back away and ping the vacant sweeper cover; so Shami kept the ball at the stumps and beat him with pace. His perfect lengths and the wicket of Cooper Connolly, the opener, set the game’s tone for India. He hurried batsmen, hustled them and injected a sense of dread. He has ensured that India would not miss their injured talisman Jasprit Bumrah.
His new-ball partner Hardik Pandya had an unrewarding day, but such is the quality and depth of India’s bowling that if one bowler endures a bad day, the others compensate. Whenever India needed a hero, someone put their hands up and delivered.
VENKATA KRISHNA B WRITES FROM DUBAI: Amidst speculation about his future, Virat Kohli shows what makes him a chase-master in ODIs against Australia in ICC Champions Trophy semis
Ravindra Jadeja, with a mysteriously underrated ODI-career, suffocated Australia’s batsmen with disciplined lengths, finishing his over in the blink of an eye and pounding the same spot repeatedly. He got the wickets of Marnus Labuschagne and Josh Inglis, two batting pillars of the world champions, thus putting the squeeze in the middle overs. Australia would have been tired of seeing him, for he pounced from nowhere to thwart straightforward singles. He is 36, but remains the spunkiest fielder among his colleagues.
The spin trio of Varun Chakaravarthy, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav rallied around him to guarantee that Australia never ran away with the match, as they often do. The choice in bowling is covetous. “That is something I really wanted, to have six bowling options and then batting till No. 8 as well,” captain Rohit Sharma would tell the host broadcasters. “This is something we discussed while making the squad. Credit to everyone involved. When you have six bowling options, you can choose from anyone you want,” he said.
As did India’s batsmen in the chase with a raft of vital contributions from Shreyas Iyer, Axar and Rahul. Nowhere in the chase did India panic. There was a phase when boundaries dried up. But Kohli did not worry. “This game is all about pressure. If you go deep into the game, the opposition usually gives in. It is important to control your impulses. Even if the run rate is six an over, I am not bothered,” he explained.
Even after Kohli got out, distraught that he did not wrap up the chase, India denied Australia any chance of a comeback. When the run-rate began to breathe down India’s nerves, Hardik Pandya effectively sealed the game with a pair of sixes off Adam Zampa in the 48th over. In pursuit of a quick finish, Pandya too held out, but Rahul remained unflustered. The experience of the batting line-up, too, is intimidating. Few teams have the luxury of someone as battle-hardened as Jadeja batting at No 8.
Rohit could also be thrilled that everyone is in top form. “When you want to play the final, you want all your guys in form. That is something that gives us a lot of confidence,” he said.
A case could be made that this was Australia’s least competent bowling attack in recent times, most of the regulars and back-ups injured. Nonetheless, India has cleared a psychological hurdle, and the elusive 50-over ICC trophy is within touching distance.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Steve Smith & Alex Carey show how it’s done as Aussies compile fighting total
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-steve-smith-alex-carey-india-australia-9868668/
Content:
For the first time in this Champions Trophy, one could see India under pressure. In each of their three outings before this semi-final, they have been precise in their planning and the execution in the middle has been mostly fool-proof.
But on Tuesday, for a large part of the afternoon, Steve Smith and Alex Carey would keep Rohit Sharma and India under the pump with some quality batting in yet another testing environment. The two put together only a 54-run stand, off just 58 deliveries, but with scores of 73 and 61 respectively powered Australia to 264 – the highest total made till in the Dubai leg.
For the fourth straight match here, a new surface was put to use. Though India have by now got familiar with conditions here, pitch No.6 that they used for the semi-final, seemed to have sowed a few doubts in them. While the square has remained dry throughout, out of all the 9 pitches, this was one that had some presence of live grass.
After their match against New Zealand, Rohit said they were not even aware which pitch they would be playing on Tuesday. When they came here in the afternoon, he would spend more time than he usually does inspecting the pitch. Maybe, the idea was to just bluff the Aussies, but Harshit Rana would go on a warm-up lap in the company of Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya.
As India lost the 14th straight toss in ODIs and Smith opted to bat first, Rohit claimed that this was a good one to lose as they were unsure what was the preferable course of action.
For a change, India were in unfamiliar territory as to what to expect. They didn’t waste any time in dismissing Cooper Connolly, which brought Smith to the middle. From there on, Australia would go about pushing India on the backfoot. Before coming here, they had played just one completed match in Pakistan, and had just a couple of net sessions. But they seemed to have done their homework as they went in search of boundaries in the first Powerplay with Travis Head providing a typical quickfire start at the top, while riding on his luck as usual.
The 33-ball 38 from the left-hander set the tone, but Smith was equally good with his intent. He got just two boundaries in the first Powerplay, and despite losing Head, in the company of Marnus Labuchagne, kept the run rate above five, something India wasn’t used to so far in this campaign.
Right through his 96-ball stay, the quality of Smith’s batsmanship stood out with a bit of luck smiling at him as well. At 13, he saw the ball roll back on to the stumps but the impact didn’t dislodge the bails. At 36, Mohammed Shami would drop a return catch.
That aside, despite playing his first game here, he knew what shots worked on this surface and, more importantly, which ones to avoid. The sweeps, which he uses to good effect against spinners, were totally absent. Instead, he would use his feet to hit straight and play the horizontal-bat shots only if the delivery merited.
India had to alter their plans, and push mid-on and mid-off fielders to the boundary. When they did so, it opened up other pockets in the field for Smith to work the gaps.
Smith saved his best for Varun Chakaravarthy, whose mystery India were counting on to provide them the edge. As the number of dot balls reduced, it was evident that Varun would have to come up with something exceptional to break Australia. However, Smith was ready for it, scoring 22 from the 24 deliveries he faced of him, hitting two boundaries that left Rohit exasperated. Without taking any risks on this pitch, Smith had India on the mat before he missed a Shami full-toss that dipped on him and hit the off-stump when he charged down the track. Those 73 were worth a lot more.
If Smith was all class, Carey brought about a bit of unpredictability. From the moment he came in, India were waiting for the left-hander to bring out his sweeps and reverse-sweeps, which he has been effective with. He wouldn’t disappoint, sweeping a wayward Kuldeep Yadav for his second boundary in the first 10 deliveries he faced.
On pitches where batsmen have struggled for timing, Carey was an exception. When Varun came for another spell, he would slog-sweep him for a six, but once India began to protect the square boundaries, the left-hander showed he had more shots in his repertoire. He would make room and hit Kuldeep over mid-on before playing an inside-out shot that fetched him another boundary.

With Smith playing the anchor role, off the first 36 deliveries Carey faced, he picked up six boundaries and a six. Though he hung around till the 48th over, he hit just two more boundaries as the wickets of Smith and Glenn Maxwell took the steam out of Australia.

Title: Virat Kohli becomes India’s highest run-scorer in Champions Trophy history, breaks Shikhar Dhawan’s record

Virat Kohli became India’s run-scorer in Champions Trophy history during the CT 2025 semi-final against Australia in Dubai on Tuesday. Kohli also completed 8000 runs in ODI run-chases, reaching the landmark when he touched 21 runs during a daunting 265-run chase in the evening. The 36-year-old reached the 8000-run mark in only his 159th innings batting second in ODIs across a 301-match career.
Kohli eventually fell on 84 off 98 ball as India qualified for their fifth Champions Trophy final with a four-wicket win. India equalled their joint-highest Champions Trophy run chase (265) to surpass Australia and qualify for Sunday’s final.
Kohli is only the second batter in history to reach 8000 ODI runs in chase after Sachin Tendulkar who leads the charts with 8720 runs from 232 innings. India captain Rohit Sharma (6115) rounds up the top three.  A master of ODI run-chases, Kohli relishes gunning down targets with 28 of his 51 centuries in the format coming while batting second. Kohli’s ton shares in chases are the best in the world, placed well ahead of Tendulkar’s 17 centuries and Rohit’s 16 tons.
Over 70 per cent of Kohli’s runs in chases (5913*) have resulted in victories, the highest by any batter in the format. Incidentally, Kohli blitzed his fastest ODI century in 52 balls during India’s highest successful run-chase (362/1) against Australia in 2013 in Jaipur.

Kohli surpasses Dhawan
Shortly before notching up his half-century, Kohli surpassed Shikhar Dhawan (701) as India’s highest run-scorer in the Champions Trophy during his fourth appearance in the tournament since 2009. Kohli is only the fourth batter to cross 700 runs in the Champions Trophy, joining  Chris Gayle (791), Mahela Jayawardena (742) and Dhawan. Kohli made 176 runs in five innings during India’s victorious 2013 campaign in England and scored a crucial 43 in the final against the hosts.
Earlier, during the league-stage match against Pakistan, Kohli slammed his 51st ODI century while becoming the fastest batter to reach 14,000 ODI runs, ahead of Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara.

Title: From CEAT to MRF: Shubman Gill joins the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli as he changes bat sticker during Champions Trophy

Content:
There was nothing new about Shubman Gill walking out to bat as Rohit Sharma’s opening partner in the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal against Australia. But there was a change in his bat sticker as the young Indian opener, who had CEAT previously, walked out in Dubai sporting an MRF sticker. The 25-year-old, who has been in good form recently, joins a list of legendary cricketers to play with a MRF bat sticker.
MRF confirmed on social media that Gill has been signed up as a brand ambassador. “MRF is delighted to welcome Shubman Gill to the MRF Family for a relationship that will endure like other Cricketing Greats who have been associated with MRF,” the company’s corporate account posted on Instagram. The sports good division account added: “With legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Brian Lara having graced the iconic MRF bat, Shubman Gill now carries forward this tradition, inspiring the next generation of cricketers.

A post shared by MRF Sports Goods Division (@mrf_sgd)
In the past, Gill has had a YouWeCan sticker, which is the name of Yuvraj Singh’s foundation. In January 2021, he batted in a Test against Australia Down Under, that had prompted New Zealand cricketer Jimmy Neesham to comment: “I don’t think Shubman will have a blank bat for long.”
Gill is currently the world No 1 batter and was named vice captain for the ICC Champions Trophy. It wasn’t the most auspicious of starts for Gill with the MRF bat though, as he was dismissed for 8 off 11 balls, inside edging the ball on the stumps off Ben Dwarshius.

Title: It’s been a different Varun Chakravarthy since he has come back to international cricket: Suryakumar Yadav
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/suryakumar-yadav-on-varun-chakravarthy-comeback-champions-trophy-india-9868543/
Content:
India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav on Tuesday said mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy has been a different player since his comeback to international cricket, for he has become mentally tougher and plays with a smile on his face.
Chakravarthy returned excellent figures of 5/42 in India’s convincing victory over New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday, which helped the team to top their group on way to the semifinals of the tournament.
“The way he left in 2021 and the way he has come back, there are two different Varun Chakravarthys,” Suryakumar, the brand ambassador of Moha, told the media here at an event.
“He has become a little tough mentally, yet he is smiling a lot and taking everything in his stride irrespective of what happens on the field which is very good from a cricketer’s point of view.” The selection of Chakravarthy, who did not feature in the first two group matches, proved to be a masterstroke.
“I am really happy for him. He deserves everything (for) what he has been doing and all the recognition for what has been happening with him,” Suryakumar added.
“He has been a really hard working athlete since 2021; I have been watching him and have spoken with him a lot of times since he made his comeback to international cricket.” Suryakumar said it is important for teams to pick players with specific skill set even though the focus has primarily been on all-rounders in the shortest format.
“At the end of the day it’s all about your skill and what skills you offer to the team. If it’s in the best interest of the team, then you have to pick those bowlers.” Suryakumar also said that Mumbai Indians will not face any leadership conundrum in the IPL given that they have each of the current Indian captains in their side.
“As soon as we go to our house, it’s like a family, so we don’t think about that, that we have three captains or we have four captains. We think that we are one team,” he said.
“It’s as good as an institution where we have learned a lot, grown over there, and gone on to play for India. We work as a unit when we get into that dressing room,” he added.
While Hardik Pandya is Mumbai Indians’ captain, the five-time winners also boast of India’s Test leader Rohit Sharma, T20I skipper Suryakumar and also Jasprit Bumrah, who had led India in two Tests on the Australia tour.
“Yes, there are a lot of captains in the team, but (when) we sit together, (be it) five people, seven, (or) ten, we take a call… how do we want to take the ship forward?” The 34-year-old Suryakumar said he wants to continue focusing on all formats for now.
“When I started playing my cricket, it was all red ball. Slowly, I came into white ball formats and then I was introduced to ODIs and then T20Is,” he said.

“It’s important, that’s why I play all the formats because I enjoy the sport. I love playing this sport with a lot of passion and I take one format at a time,” he said.

Title: IND vs AUS | Champions Trophy: How Glenn Maxwell brain-fade proved costly as Australia are bowled out well below 300

IND vs AUS Champions Trophy 2025: Glenn Maxwell has played some of the most memorable innings in white-ball cricket, but his game is not built around consistency. He is an impact player, an x-factor who can’t be expected to contribute with the bat in every game. But sometimes, when he is in for a good time and not necessarily a long time, his team management may question his game-reading ability. One guesses they have made their peace with it over the years.
IND vs AUS Semi-Final LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
On Tuesday, Steve Smith and Alex Carey had taken Australia to a position from where they could launch towards a score of 280 or more. When the skipper got out, there were enough overs left for Maxwell to play a proper innings, get set before launching in the final overs.
Conventional logic, however, rarely applies to Maxwell. He gave himself only three balls, two from Mohammed Shami and one from Axar Patel, before he launched the left-arm spinner over deep square-leg for six. With more than 12 overs left, he could have then put his head down and played the occasional big shot. As his normal scoring rate when set is more than quick enough. But he went for an across-the-line hoick next ball, to be bowled.
It was the cue for India to come back in the game with a vengeance and when Australia were bowled out with three balls left for 265, they would have felt they left a few runs out there. It exposed the lower order and ensured that Carey couldn’t bat with the freedom he would have liked. The likes of Ben Dwarshius couldn’t be expected to counter the wiles and mystery of Varun Chakravarthy when the need of the hour was acceleration. If two genuine batsmen had been in the middle in the end overs, they could have even threatened the 300-run mark too.

India have been set a daunting 265-run target by Australia in the Champions Trophy 2025 semi-final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai after the coin flip favoured Steve Smith who opted to bat first.
Losing a 14th toss in succession on a dry pitch that is being used for the first time in this tournament, Rohit Sharma and Co. will have a heightened challenge as Australia have ensured that they have gotten enough on board to put the knockout pressure on the opposition.
IND vs AUS Semi-Final LIVE Blog Updates
The highest target gunned down in a 50-over ICC knockout match remains from the 2015 World Cup where New Zealand were set a revised 298-run DLS target in 43 overs after South Africa got to 281/5 in 43. As Grant Elliot’s unbeaten 84 broke Proteas’ hearts, the Kiwi chase entered the record books as the highest successful chase in a World Cup knockout match. New Zealand are the only team to hit 300-plus in a ICC ODI knockout match. The Kiwis gave India a massive scare when they did during the 2023 ODI World Cup semi-final in Mumbai, but Mohammed Shami’s seven-wicket haul eventually stopped them at 327, handing India a 70-run win.
With the Aussie scaling to a healthy total in Dubai, India will have their task cut out in their bid to make another Champions Trophy final.
The highest successful chase in a Champions Trophy knockout match occurred in the inaugural edition of the tournament in 1998 when South Africa chased down 282 against England in the first quarter-final in Dhaka.

India’s highest successful chase in an ICC Champions Trophy match took place in the 2017 edition when they overhauled a 265-run target against Bangladesh in the semi-final in Birmingham. It remains the joint second-highest successful run chase in the Champions Trophy, alongside New Zealand’s 265-run chase against India in the 2000 CT final. They will need to equal the same in Dubai to beat Australia on Tuesday.
India have chased down a 250-plus score in a World Cup/Champions Trophy knockout match twice besids the 265 chase against Bangladesh in CT 2017. India’s highest remains the 275-run chase against Sri Lanka in the 2011 ODI World Cup final in Mumbai. The Men in Blue also chased down a target of 261 against Australia in Ahmedabad in the quarterfinal of that edition.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘There’s that little bit more class in the South African line-up’: Ricky Ponting backs SA against NZ in 2nd semifinal
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-semi-ricky-ponting-picks-south-africa-sa-vs-nz-9868274/
Content:
Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting on Tuesday said that South Africa are favourites against New Zealand in the second semifinal, scheduled to take place in Lahore on Wednesday. Ponting reasons that the Proteas’ deep batting lineup is the reason that they hold the edge over the Kiwis.
“If I look at both the sides, I think there’s that little bit more class in the South African line-up. They bat deep. I think they might have a little bit too much power for New Zealand,” Pointing opined on ICC Review on Tuesday.
“I’m actually going with South Africa (to win the contest) as much as I’ve praised New Zealand,” he added.
Ponting also feels the likes of opener Ryan Rickelton, skipper Temba Bavuma, Aiden Markram, David Miller and Heinrich Klaasen could make things difficult for the Kiwis.
“He’s (Klaasen) very important because he is such a dangerous player of spin bowling. He’s such a great, clean hitter of spin. He is important to the middle order but South Africa bat deep like India. And, with a world-class all-rounder like Marco Jansen and obviously Aiden Markram, (Temba) Bavuma, David Miller… their batting is really strong. That middle order.
“I think Klaasen has been the No.1 T20 batter for long and if he brings that sort of stuff to the 50-over game… If he goes in around the 30-over mark and South Africa are 2-3 down, then he can be truly dangerous,” he said.
However, the former Australian player said that if Kane Williamson plays well, the Kiwis might retake the advantage from the Proteas. Williamson hasn’t had the best Champions Trophy scoring 1 against Pakistan and 5 against Bangladesh. But he found form in the last group A game against India where he scored 81 runs.

“Williamson, I think, needs to make runs for them in this game. Every team needs their big players standing up in big moments. Big games mean big names. It doesn’t get bigger than the Champions Trophy semifinals. And, Williamson is a big-game player, he will understand the enormity of his role going into the game and I won’t be surprised if he gets the job done,” Ponting said.

After Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed’s comments on India skipper Rohit Sharma kicking up a storm of controversy on Monday, Sunil Gavaskar said mental strength matters in cricket and not physical size. Mohamed had called Rohit “fat for a sportsman” and described him as “the most unimpressive Captain India has ever had” on X before she was forced to delete the post due to backlash.
“I have always said, if you want only slim guys, then you should go to a modelling competition and pick all the models. It’s not about that,” Gavaskar told India Today.
“It’s about how well you can play cricket. We talked about Sarfaraz Khan, he was vilified for a long time because he was on the heavier side. But if he scores 150 for India in a Test match and follows it up with another two or three fifty-plus scores, then what’s the issue? I don’t think size has anything to do with it. It’s your mental strength —whether you can last the distance—that’s the most important thing. Bat well, bat for long, and score runs,” he added.
Uninon sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya had also slammed these comments on Rohit’s physique and fitness on Monday.
“Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic,” the minister had posted on X.

“Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,” he had added.

Title: Will Aussies regret asking Ravindra Jadeja to remove tape on fingers? Remember when they asked Ambrose, curtly
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravindra-jadeja-tape-removed-australia-ambrose-champions-trophy-9868181/
Content:
When Marnus Labuschagne was peering over the shoulder of the umpire who was talking to Ravindra Jadeja, one wonders if he thought about THAT Dean Jones incident. It’s not clear which batsman complained (Steve Smith or Labuschagne), but someone ought to have, as otherwise the umpires wouldn’t have got into the act. And Richard Illingworth told Jadeja to remove the tape that was bandaged around his left palms, the bowling hand.
Jadeja tried to make his plea that he was injured but it was within the right of the batsmen and the umpire to ask a bowler to remove anything from the hands that can be seen as obstructing the view for the batsmen.
Dean Jones, another Australian batsman, once asked Curtly Ambrose to remove the wrist bands. Here is the episode in the words of Ambrose, culled out from his book. “I figured it was a stupid request, to be frank – and I said I wasn’t going to take them off. It was crazy. Our captain Richie Richardson persuaded me to do it but I was furious. Up to that point I’d been bowling within myself because it was a one-day game and I was keeping things tight but then I started bowling a lot quicker. I really wanted to make Jones uncomfortable. We won the game quite easily. I understand the Australian dressing room weren’t happy with Jones for riling me up!”
In the here and now, Jadeja’s plea wasn’t heard. He protested again next over when fielding a shot hit back at him that hurt his now un-taped hand. But he had his Ambrose moment though: he trapped Labuschagne lbw in front and induced Josh Inglis to punch straight to covers.
Incidentally Illingworth who played in the 1992 World Cup final for England was also the umpire in the 2023 final that India lost to Australia.
For those interested in the Jones incident, here is a postscript. Long after he retired, Jones wrote a piece for SMH, where he mentioned how it wasn’t just his decision but he had sought the permission of his coach Bob Simpson. “I wanted Simmo’s approval before I went out to bat. I was blown away when Bob agreed, obviously feeling very remorseful on my non-Test selection. Once Simpson agreed, the whole team went hysterical. “You will get us killed,” they yelled at me. I personally couldn’t give a shit about them as they were going to Adelaide (after the ODI series to play the Tests.) So when Boony nicked off to Ambrose, I then passed Mark and Steve Waugh going out to bat. Mark then said to Steve, “He is not going to do it, is he?” I then thought, “gee … they do talk!” I had never heard them speak to each other in the years I have known them.

… Well the next three deliveries were probably the quickest I ever faced! I was thinking, “What the hell have I done?” I have a compound fracture of the right thumb and a hand I can’t feel. And when the umpire called “over”, I had 11 West Indians and one Australian batsman sledging me! Mark Taylor was furious. Tubby yelled out, “What are you doing? I have two kids. What are you thinking?”

Title: IND vs AUS | Champions Trophy: R Ashwin proposes, Varun Chakaravarthy disposes Head in his own way

Content:
IND vs AUS Champions Trophy 2025: On match eve, R Ashwin had suggested that Varun Chakravarthy be given the new ball against Travis Head and that he can bowl from over the wicket to the left-handed opener. “If Rohit has to play with Head’s head, then he has to hand the new ball to Varun. Tell him ‘khulke daalo’ like Ravi (Shastri) bhai would, give it to Varun and ask him to bowl over the stumps. Head shows all his three stumps and then clears his leg and hits it over the field. Varun Chakravarthy with new ball might give India an edge. It will be a mouth watering contest,” Ashwin had said on his YouTube channel.
Ashwin was proved right, but with a difference. Rohit Sharma didn’t give the new ball or first-change to Varun, but brought him on as second spinner, after Kuldeep Yadav. And Varun went about it in his own way, choosing to go around the stumps, and not over.

It was his very first delivery to Travis Head, and there was a long-off in place. And he squeezed a wrong-one out of his fingers, and the ball deviated just a bit. Head went down town straight all right, not against the turn, but it was perhaps a touch too early in the piece against Varun. He had bashed a few against the others but Varun’s pace, release could have been waited out. But then that wouldn’t be Head. Instead he went for it.
It wasn’t a great shot even if the direction was fine – not against the turn, as there wasn’t much power behind the shot considering long-off was in place. Perhaps he thought he could chip it straighter to the sight-screen. But here he was done in by that googly that broke away just a bit.
Watch Ashwin’s preview:
And something what Ashwin said, helps in understanding that final bit of deception better.
“I don’t think playing Varun is a risk. I think they are not able to read him at all. He is not beating batters on the outside edge, and that’s why I am not able to understand why they are not able to decipher him. What is setting him apart? It’s the amount of revs that is allowing the ball to drop. It’s not dropping at 89 kph; it’s dropping at high 90s. It’s unbelievable skill,” Ashwin had said.
That amount of revolutions that get the ball to drop at that speed  – the wicket ball was almost 92 kmph (91.9 to be exact), and when it dropped rapidly and broke on this pitch, the combo proved too deadly for Travis Head. And the game was, potentially, turned on its head.

IND vs AUS Champions Trophy 2025: It’s now become a norm as India captain Rohit Sharma lost yet another toss ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal against Australia in Dubai. Rohit has lost an 11th straight toss in ODIs, while India’s record extended to 14 as Steve Smith called right in Dubai and opted to bat first.
The last time India won a toss in men’s ODI was in the semifinal of the 2023 World Cup against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. The toss-loss streak of 14 is already the longest in this format, with the second worst streak among teams belonging to the Netherlands at 11. Rohit, with his 11th straight toss loss, is now joint second most with Peter Borren. Former West Indies captain Brian Lara had lost toss in 12 consecutive games

Rohit, perhaps with a hint of resignation, said: “I was prepared to do both. The wickets at this venue have played differently over the last three matches. So, when you are in two minds it is better to lose the toss.” Against New Zealand on Sunday, he said he would have preferred to bat first anyway.
Australia made two changes from their previous combination in the washed out match against Afghanistan, bringing in Cooper Connolly for injured Matthews Short and Tanveer Sangha for Spencer Johnson. India fielded the same playing XI of their previous match, with Varun Chakravarthy retaining his spot over Harshit Rana. On a dry pitch, both teams opted to pack. their teams with spin bowling options.
India XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy.
Australia XI: Steven Smith (c), Cooper Connolly, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Tanveer Sangha.

Title: R Ashwin’s advice to Rohit Sharma ahead of semifinal match vs Australia: ‘Give the new ball to Varun Chakravarthy’

Content:
R Ashwin has just one advice for Team India captain Rohit Sharma and that is to give the new ball to Varun Chakravarthy against Travis Head in the first semifinal against Australia, which will be played in the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
Against New Zealand, Varun Chakravarthy did most of the damage as India won the match by 44 runs on Sunday. Chakravarthy took 5 for 42, his first five-wicket haul in only his second one-day international.
“Take the new ball and give it to Varun and ask him to bowl over the stumps to Travis Head,” Ashwin said on his Hindi Youtube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“Travis Head shows all his three stumps and then clears his leg and hit it over the field. Varun Chakravarthy with new ball might give India an edge. It will be a mouth watering contest,” he said.
Ashwin has said the battle between Travis Head and
Will Travis Head take on Varun Chakravarthy will be the key match up in the semifinal.
“I would be very surprised if Travis Head will take on a back seat against Varun. He would love to go aggressive and it will high-risk option. Either he will give Australia good start or India will get him out cheaply.
“If Travis Head doesn’t take him on, then keeps Varun on for five overs.
“This Australian team has too many right-handedness and for that we have Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel.
“If I am India then I won’t be worried about this bowling line-up of India.
“Win the toss, put them to bat. Give them the responsibility to set the total. If we get Travis Head’s wicket then it will be India’s game to control.
“If India will bat first, there is no doubt in my mind that India will score above par score unless Spencer Johnson bowls a fiery first spell.
“India will go in the game as a favourite with this spin choke but Australia will have nothing to lose.
“If new ball will be given to Varun then I don’t see Head scoring more,” he said.

Title: Dinesh Karthik on India vs Australia 1st semifinal: ‘Travis Head is the difference between winning and losing’

Dinesh Karthik said Travis Head will be again the key wicket for India in the first semifinal between India versus Australia in Dubai on Tuesday. Australia have defeated India in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad.
“It used to be New Zealand for a wee bit. In these knockout games, they always had the better of India, but you have to say it’s Australia at this point of time,” Dinesh Karthik told Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain in the Sky Sports podcast.
“If at all, there is a team that they would think that on most days they’ll challenge India has to be Australia. And it’s actually what Ravi Shastri said, you know, at this point of time, the mental block is more one player than Australia itself, Travis Headache.

“He has actually, in any format. And they will be looking for that wicket because that wicket early will actually make them breathe a lot easier for the rest of the game, because World Test Championship Final, the recently concluded Australia Series, World Cup Final, you take any big game, he’s actually scored once. And he’s been the difference between winning and losing.”
Nasser Hussain said it might get tricky if India gets Travis Head early then they might have to be careful. He said: “Don’t take your eye off just because suddenly you get a key man out.”
Karthik replied: “Couldn’t agree with you more. Definitely, it’s not the end of the game, but I think they’ll breathe a lot easier because till the time he’s around, especially the tempo that he’s batting, because they’ve tried tactically various fields, various lines, he just finds a way to get that boundary.”
With no Bumarah, what will be India’s plan against Travis Head?
“I have a feeling they will end up playing four spinners, especially with the way Varun bowled and this pitch, more than anything else, it makes sense to play Varun and he is, again, a wicket-taking opportunity against a lot of the Australians,” said Karthik.
“People who have played him in IPL will know him a little better, but the guys who are playing him for the first time, he is a challenge without a doubt because he turns the ball both ways and hits a very consistent length as well.
“With Travis Head, it’s very obvious, you know, his strength could easily be his weakness, which is if you bowl outside the off stump and it swings a bit, he could definitely call, but also he doesn’t back away from slashing at it. Yeah, and it has swung here a little bit more than in Pakistan, it has, the new ball has, but you have to be spot on with him. His margin for error, we do this, the technology on the TV, where if you have fourth stump, it goes for four and if you’re a middle and leg, it goes for four, leg side, he plays that pick-up shot, so you have to be sort of top of middle and off stump.”

The Champions Trophy enters its business end as India take on familiar foes Australia in the first semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday. With all the outside noise about India having the advantage of staying put in Dubai and playing all their matches there while other have to travel, skipper Rohit Sharma on Monday rubbished the claim saying that the pitches have offered challenges for them too.

Australia have been one of India’s bogey teams when it comes to ICC knockout ties with the Men in Blue having failed to defeat them since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinals. They have notched up wins against them in Group stage as well as Super 8 matches, most recently in the T20 World Cup 2024 but have failed to defeat the Aussies when it matters the most. The last time these two sides met in an ICC 50-over event, the Aussies had come out on top on that fateful day in Ahmedabad when they defeated India to become the 2023 ODI World Cup champions.
The pitch in Dubai have been more on the sluggish side as compared to the high scoring pitches back in Pakistan. With India packing their team with quality spinners, expect them to utilize them on the surface which assists tweakers. Australia are coming into the semifinal having played in just high-scoring pitches and will likely have to alter their strategy for the Dubai surface.

With less than a 36-hour turnaround since their clinical spin strangulation of New Zealand at the venue, India will hope to keep their rich vein of ODI form going, even as Australia have dominated the Men in Blue in semi-final/final meetings. But with a fresh pitch on offer at the ground, will India continue their newfound four-spinner strategy or fall back on another frontline pacer to assist Mohammed Shami or Hardik Pandya?
Rohit Sharma’s men will be excited by the prospect of posing Varun Chakaravarthy’s mystery and rely on their current bowling strength – spin – to counter Australia in the vast playing arena in Dubai. India’s four-pronged spin attack made a comparatively below-par total seem a mountain for the in-form New Zealanders to chase on Sunday. While seamer Mohammed Shami has not at been at his prolific best, it is unlikely that India will alter their seam attack while retaining their bolstered spin quartet for the semi-final job.

Connolly over JFM?
While Australia have an option of replacing their injured opening all-rounder Matt Short with a hard-hitting bat in Jake Fraser-McGurk, Steve Smith’s men will likely opt for a precautionary spin-bowling all-rounder in Cooper Conolly in the middle-order instead. Wicket-keeper Josh Inglis who smoked his maiden century in Australia’s campaign opener against England in Lahore could then step up fill in the opener’s slot for the big clash.

Title: Is Travis Head the luckiest opening batsman or is it a parochial Indian fan’s lament?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/travis-head-luckiest-batsman-analysis-ind-aus-champions-trophy-9866687/
Content:
No Australian cricketer in recent memory, not even Steve Smith, has lived rent-free in Indian fans’ head as much as their dazzling opener Travis Head. Re-runs of Head’s knock in the 2023 ODI world cup final might have vanished from Indian television and streaming devices but his assault has lived on in the minds. And with a caveat: the lingering chance-laden Powerplay, where Head was beaten and squared up by Bumrah and Shami but not felled in that final, continues to make the fans squirm.
Not that Head’s tryst with India is limited to that game. Before that in the home Test series in India, or in WTC final at the Oval, and now more recently in Australia, he has repeatedly stunned the Indians. But is there any truth about Head’s “lucky streak” or is it just a parochial fan’s lament?
Perhaps no cricketer has straddled with fortune as often as Head has in recent years. But what the 31-year-old does with that added vial of opportunities defines his belligerence across formats.
When Mohammad Shami steps up with the new ball on Tuesday, it will be hard to suppress memories from that cold, fragile night in Ahmedabad. There will be no Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj to share the burden – the pain of those close shaves with Head’s outside edge, his off-stump and the wickets in total that never converted into a single-digit dismissal off a deviously snaking white Kookaburra. He would total 137 in 120 balls. Australia, a sixth World Cup.

India will need not look beyond Head’s two Champions Trophy outings to reaffirm that he will continue to offer a hoard of chances early on. It is up to Rohit’s men to seize the first given opportunity.
When Jofra Archer offered a wide, out-swinging delivery on length under lights in Lahore, Head’s half-baked swipe chipped straight back to the bowler’s pocket, falling for 6 (5) in the third over. Chasing 274 in a rain-marred clash against Afghanistan at the same venue six days later, Head teased the brutality of a contrast. Left-arm seamer Fazalhaq Farooqi swung the ball away from a similar patch of Archer’s from a shorter length. Batting on 6* (5) this time, Head’s mistimed pull was put down by a fumbling Rashid Khan at mid-on. He smothered eight boundaries in the next 34 balls before a washout sealed Australia’s knock-out spot.

Rohit would remember an IPL night from last year too when the South Australian butchered Mumbai Indians on his SunRisers Hyderabad debut. Dropped on nine in the second over of the match, Head would immediately clobber 20 off four deliveries in the next over, finishing on 62 off 24 as SRH posted a colossal 277 on board.

Head and the Powerplay ‘opening’
Risk and chances, a slew of them in succession, are intrinsic to Head’s gameplay across formats. The fatalities of a drop or missed opportunity are pronounced in the white-ball set-ups where Head nearly leaves no delivery unattended.
According to Cricket-21 data, Head has left only two percent of the total deliveries (433) he has faced against the new ball in the first Powerplay across 21 ODI outings since 2023. In comparison, India openers Rohit and Shubman Gill leave about seven percent of their respective deliveries in the Powerplay.
Head’s protracted reliance on boundaries exaggerates the risks in the Powerplay. His non-boundary strike rate sticks at 27.1, with Gill (32.71) and Rohit (31.54) posing relatively higher emphasis on running between the wickets.
Stacking up against the four highest run-scoring ODI openers (Rohit, Gill, Will Young and Pathum Nissanka) in this period, Head’s false-shot percentage (shots not middled) stands the highest at 29. The Aussie left-hander is also beaten more than his contemporaries, with 11 percentage (47.8) deliveries making up his Powerplay shares. The corresponding figures for Rohit and Gill read 7% and 5% respectively.
Credit: Cricket-21
Head’s erratic starts have also borne more than 70 edged strokes in this period, collectively indicating a chance for the opposition nearly every 3.4 deliveries he faces in the ODI Powerplay. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence then that Head’s T20I strokeplay displays similar strands of streakiness in the first six overs, with negligible deviation in the false shot percentages.
Head, however, has mastered leveraging his second chances to its fullest. A third of Head’s 905 runs in ODIs since the last World Cup year have come on the back of dropped chances. Dropped on a staggering 12 of the total 29 dismissal chances he has offered in 21 innings, Head has gathered 302 runs — each let-off adding 37.8 more runs to his and Australia’s tally.
While Gill aggregates more (44.1) with each dropped catch and Rohit (34.1) nearly matches up to the Aussie’s effectiveness from a reprieve, the Indian openers offer significantly condensed false strokes (7.6) per dismissal when stacked up against Head who exudes about 10 false shots between each of his 17 dismissals in the last two years.

Dubai could be no different for the nerveless Head. He will leave breadcrumbs for India and wield the willow as hard as ever, but make ‘em pay for any loose ends early on.

Title: Champions Trophy: How Shreyas Iyer, Rohit Sharma are the faces of India’s risk management
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-shreyas-iyer-rohit-sharma-india-risk-management-9866605/
Content:
As pitches in Dubai seem to be getting slower with each outing, all eyes are on the Indian spinners. However, for India to go the distance a lot is riding on the batting unit, which so far has adapted exceptionally to the sort of tracks that have been their biggest undoing in recent times.
With a century each to Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli, they have two in-form batsmen in the top three to go with Rohit Sharma to provide rapid starts. In the middle overs where they need to be flexible with their approach against spinners, they have a solid middle-order which includes an enforcer in Shreyas Iyer and two busy players in Axar Patel and KL Rahul before the finishing job is handed over to Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja.
This is as good a top 8 as a team could get in these conditions where batting depth is absolutely a non-negotiable factor. But two of those, Rohit and Shreyas, strategically placed at the top and at No 4 provide the right sort of impetus for the rest of the batting unit to go about their game without having to sacrifice much. Though the pitches have behaved differently in these three matches because of varying conditions which have been hotter during the day and chilly in the evening, they have consistently remained slow.
On such slow surfaces, runs with the new ball have become a gold reserve irrespective of whether the team is batting first or chasing. In each of his three innings, Rohit’s intention has been clear. Carrying on a role he first embraced during the World Cup in 2023, he is ensuring India has a head start when the pitch is fresh and the ball is new. In their two chases here, India had 69 and 64 runs by the end of first powerplay.
While Rohit may not have been as effective in the Champions Trophy as he was at the World Cup, what it is doing is giving some valuable run cushions for the middle-order to count on. It is giving the in-coming batsmen the time to get used to the slowness of the pitch without having to bother about keeping pace with the run-rate. Against New Zealand, when Rohit fell early, even Virat Kohli – when was the last time we saw him play the cut off seamers? — tried to make the most out of the fielding restrictions as rotating the strike in the middle overs hasn’t been easy.
With Rahul, Pandya and Axar around, if India went their old school way of keeping wickets in hand before unleashing in the last 10 overs, there is no guarantee it could work. At the death, seamers have repeatedly taken pace off the ball, and teams have even employed spinners. With that being the case, demoting Rahul to No 6 with Jadeja to follow fits perfectly with their plan.
If Rohit provides the charge at the top, there is Shreyas for the middle overs. Against Pakistan, with a 67-ball 56 he made a tight chase look routine, charging at the spinners and using his positive intent to good effect. On Sunday, he had an even tougher job at hand. Earlier in the tournament while talking of his method as a middle-order batsman, Shreyas mentioned how he prefers to go on the offensive if they have lost early wickets to put the pressure on the opposition.
To do so on this pitch was easier said than done, particularly when the Kiwi quicks were generating movement off the seam. Instead, he would take 31 deliveries to get his first boundary and once he got that, he would find two more in the next three deliveries and from there on he looked a different beast. An exceptional player against spinners, even when Mitchell Santner tempted him by slowing down the pace and invited him to step down by giving enough flight, Shreyas would resist. Happy to even defend, as on this pitch, he was fully aware of the damage that Santner could do. Instead, when Michael Bracewell and Rachin Ravindra came on, he wasted no time to put them under early pressure. He brought out his trademark lofted shots on the leg-side, while also improvising at the same time.
When Shreyas aces his role, which he has been consistently doing in the middle-order, it is also allowing the rest of the batsmen to play their game without looking at the scoreboard. So far in this tournament, he has hit 11 boundaries (behind Gill’s 16 as an opener) – all in the most challenging middle-overs and three sixes. Batting at No 4 he has a strike-rate of 82.41, showing the game to adapt to these conditions.

It is for this reason that Australia, prior to the World Cup final, spent most of their time in the planning room around how to take down Shreyas, celebrating his plotted dismissal with glee. On Tuesday, at the Champions Trophy final, he will remain the focus of their crosshairs.

Title: Padmakar Shivalkar, left-arm spin stalwart of 1960s and 70s, passes away
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/padmakar-shivalkar-left-arm-spin-stalwart-death-passes-away-9866586/
Content:
Padmakar Shivalkar, one of the finest left-arm spinners the country has produced, passed away in Mumbai on Monday. He was 84 and was unwell for the past few months.
Shivalkar, one of the stalwarts in the 1960s and 70s when Mumbai ruled the domestic scene unchallenged, never got to represent the country as it was a period when Bishan Singh Bedi was the incumbent left-arm spinner in the Indian team. In 124 First-Class games, he amassed 589 wickets.
After retirement, Shivalkar also coached the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team.
Shivalkar’s demise comes on the heels of former Mumbai captain Milind Rege’s death and cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar expressed grief at the loss.
“This is very sad news indeed. Within a short time, Mumbai cricket has lost two of its stalwarts, Milind and now Padmakar, who were the architects of many a victory,” the master batsman said.
“One of my regrets as India captain is not being able to convince the national selectors to include ‘Paddy’ in the Test team. He deserved the India cap far more than some others who got it. That’s fate. He was the bowler who would get the best batter from the opposition out and set up wins for Mumbai. He could bowl the whole day with his economical run-up and beautiful action. Paddy was one of a kind and am deeply saddened by his passing away.”
In 2017, Shivalkar was conferred with the BCCI CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award along with his contemporary left-arm spinner Rajendra Goel, who too didn’t get a chance to represent India.
Former India opener Wasim Jaffer also condoled the death.
“One of Mumbai’s greatest match-winners, a stalwart of the game who, despite his immense record in First-Class cricket, was unfortunate never to don the Indian cap,” Jaffer said. “A cricketer of remarkable humility and simplicity, he was admired both on and off the field. My deepest condolences to his family during this difficult time.”
After his playing days, Shivalkar involved himself in coaching at Shivaji Park. He spotted young talents like Harmeet Singh, who went on to play for India Under-19 and Mumbai, before representing the USA.
Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president Ajinkya Naik said, “Mumbai cricket has lost a true legend today. Padmakar Shivalkar Sir’s contribution to the game, especially as one of the finest spinners of all time, will always be remembered. His dedication, skill, and impact on Mumbai cricket are unparalleled. His passing is an irreplaceable loss to the cricketing fraternity.”

Shivalkar was never one to crib about the past and the absence of an India cap.
“Hope you have listened to the iconic composition Main Zindagi ka saath nibhata Chala Gaya (from the movie Hum Dono). It has a line, Jo Mila Usiko Muqaddar samajh liya (Whatever you get is destiny). For me, I have reached that stage of life where these things have become trivial,” he was quoted by PTI after receiving the BCCI award.

Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday slammed Congress and the Trinamool Congress for making inappropriate comments on India skipper Rohit Sharma. This was after INC spokesperson Shama Mohamed had ‘fat-shamed’ Team India captain Rohit Sharma in a now-deleted X post.
Mohamed, in a now-deleted X post, criticised Rohit Sharma during the India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy match on Sunday. She wrote in her post that Sharma is “fat for a sportsman.” “Need to lose weight! And ofcourse the most unimpressive Captain India has ever had,” she added.
Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Ray had also echoed Shama’s thoughts earlier in the day. “I agree, this is not about politics, this is about cricket. How many days will Rohit Sharma be given a pass? Scoring a century once in two years and getting out quickly in other matches don’t justify his place in the team. He should not remain an authority in the team. The Congress leader is correct in saying this. Even about his weight, there’s concern. Yes, he is overweight, but people don’t seem to care,” Roy said as per ANI.
Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives.
Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright…

Reacting to these comments, Mandaviya posted on X, “Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic.”
“Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,” he added.

BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia also slammed Shama for questioning Rohit Sharma’s captaincy credentials and fitness levels, saying it was very unfortunate for a responsible person to pass such a trivial comment in the middle of the national team’s Champions Trophy campaign.

BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia on Monday slammed Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed for questioning India captain Rohit Sharma’s captaincy credentials and fitness levels, saying it was very unfortunate for a responsible person to pass such a trivial comment in the middle of the national team’s Champions Trophy campaign.
India have reached the semifinals of the ICC event and play Australia in the semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday. They beat New Zealand on Sunday to top their group.
“Very unfortunate for a responsible person to pass such a trivial comment when the team is in the midst of such a marquee ICC tournament. It may have demoralizing effect on an individual or the team,” Saikia told PTI.
“All the players are performing to their highest potential and results are visible. I hope individuals shall desist from making such derogatory statements for personal publicity sake at the cost of National Interest,” he added.
Shama caused a stir on social media with a controversial post directed at the Indian captain.
Acknowledging her comments were out of line, Congress asked Shama to delete the post from her ‘X’ account.

In her now-deleted post, Shama said Rohit is “fat for a sportsman”. “Need to lose weight! And of course the most unimpressive Captain India has ever had!”

Title: Rishabh Pant nominated for Laureus World Sports Award in comeback of the year category

Content:
Rishabh Pant has been nominated for the prestigious Laureus World Sports Award 2025 in the comeback of the year category after his return to the Indian side after surviving a horrific car accident in December 2022. The awards ceremony will take place in Madrid on April 21.
Pant had suffered multiple injuries when his car collided with a road divider on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. The player, who was going to his home in Roorkee, was taken to a local hospital before being shifted to Dehradun. He had suffered injuries on his head, back and feet.
After undergoing initial treatment at a hospital in Dehradun, Pant was airlifted to Mumbai where he was under the care of the BCCI’s specialist consultant. Once the surgeries to reconstruct all three ligaments in his right knee were performed, Pant did his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru.
The 27-year-old made a remarkable recovery and returned to action for his then IPL franchise Delhi Capitals against Punjab Kings last year in Mullanpur.
Pant then made a triumphant return to Test cricket, scoring a century against Bangladesh in his first game in the format since his car accident. His performance helped India secure a 280-run victory.
Last year, on the Club Prairie Fire podcast co-hosted by former England captain Michael Vaughan and his childhood hero Adam Gilchrist, Pant revealed what his return to cricket meant for him.

“I am excited but nervous at the same time. When you are sitting outside talking about the return it is a different thing. But when you return inside the field, it is a completely different atmosphere. I am having goosebumps thinking about it,” Pant had said.

Title: Champions Trophy semifinal: Advantage India but it’s not about schedule, team selection or travel but familiarity with the pitches
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-semifinal-india-advantage-australia-9866409/
Content:
For two weeks now, Indian cricketers have woken up from the same hotel rooms, travelled on the team bus on the by-now familiar route, and most importantly practiced and played on the sluggish tracks at the Dubai cricket stadium. There is no denying the India advantage; not in the trivial familiarity of rooms or non-existent flight travel but because of the contrasting nature of the pitches on offer in sluggish Dubai and batting-friendly Pakistan. But there is a nuance to this advantage.
The understandable whining over India’s advantage misses the point about the all-round strength in the Indian squad. It has been said that if they knew they were only playing in Dubai, a few other teams also would have packed their squad with more spinners. The fact is India have quality options; not many others have. That’s why only New Zealand, who also played their majority games in Pakistan thus far, have still stacked their squad with enough tweakers. Also, in this day and age, taking one flight from Lahore or Karachi to Dubai isn’t much.
But the main advantage isn’t that of schedule or squad-selection, but of the nature of the pitches. As even India found out in the 2023 ODI world cup, a slow turner at Ahmedabad couldn’t help them as they themselves had played just one game, against Pakistan, in that tournament there. More regularly a team trains and plays on sluggish tracks, the more equipped and ready they get; there is a reason why Chennai Super Kings dominate at Chepauk.
Other teams haven’t had that luxury. In tournament cricket, there is nothing new in terms of a team playing each of their matches at different venues. Unless the event is taking place in Bangladesh or Sri Lanka, it happens all the time. However, no team has got this sort of advantage when it comes to playing all their matches at one venue, which has allowed India to get acclimatised to the conditions here. They came here six days before their first match and after their second outing, got a week’s break to get further used to the conditions and it shows in the middle.
Of course, teams these days have the luxury of replicating such conditions in practice arenas. But this hasn’t been a dust bowl or a crumbling pitch where there is sharp turn and bounce to get used to. Instead, it is on the slower side, which even if teams want to replicate it can only be possible to an extent and will know the actual nature of it when they are in the middle as it is a natural wear and tear.
When New Zealand boarded the flight from Rawalpindi to Dubai last week, they knew what to expect here. As their pacer Matt Henry admitted after the humbling on Sunday, they knew India would take the field with four spinners, particularly with just one rest day in between the semi-finals. But no pre knowledge is going to help any of the teams to play in Dubai.
In terms of personnel, there is a familiarity around all of India’s spinners – Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar. With regards to Varun as well, by now all teams have access to his videos. There is enough time to just play him off safely, and target the other bowlers. Against New Zealand, India put this plan to good use by playing Mitchell Santner safely and going after Michael Bracewell and Rachin Ravindra.
But so far in the three matches, no opposition batting line-up has been able to do that against the Indian spinners. While their exceptional control of the craft has definitely had a role in it, what also can’t be overlooked is how little time their opponents have had when it comes to getting used to the conditions in Dubai.
Bangladesh, Pakistan and New Zealand had just two sessions before their match here. So will be the case with Australia, who landed here on Saturday and managed time for two sessions and just one on stadium. Though the practice pitches at the ICC Academy are similar in nature, the square at Dubai International Stadium has been slow in nature. It hasn’t been sluggish like Premadasa or Mirpur, but it is definitely slow enough for batsmen to come in and get adjusted to it no matter how hard you prepare on the practice pitches. Add the slow outfield and the big boundaries they have to cover and the new angles to score off, these are not easy conditions for batsmen to get used to immediately.
Perhaps tired of the advantage talk, India’s captain Rohit Sharma sought to point out how the pitches have presented varying challenges.
“Look, the three matches we played, the nature of the surface was the same. But in all three games, the pitch has behaved differently. Today (Sunday), we saw the ball was swinging a little. We didn’t see that in the first two games when our bowlers were bowling. And in the evening, it’s a little cold in the air. So, there are obviously a lot of chances of that swing. We know this. But the three games we played, there are four or five surfaces that are being used. So, every surface has a different nature. We don’t know which wicket will be played. The pitches look the same, but when you play on it, it’s played in a different way,” Rohit said.
“Because of the different pitches, the pitch is giving you different challenges as a batsman. We have to think whether it’s necessary to play these shots or not. When the bowler was bowling, we saw a little spin today. We didn’t see that much spin in the last game. So, there are different things happening on every surface. So, we know what is going to happen on this pitch and what’s not. This is not our home, this is Dubai. So, we don’t play so many matches here. This is new for us too,” Rohit said.
Only, it’s been totally new-er to the rest. Next up is Australia, a team that could face more problems when it comes to solving the puzzle. With Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood not around, their attack is already thin on experience. Much of their hope is on Adam Zampa’s leg-spin and Glenn Maxwell and they could even be tempted to play Tanveer Sangha. But more than the bowling, what will decide the outcome is how soon their batting unit can get used to the conditions here. If Travis Head can give a quickfire start and Steve Smith decides to drop anchor, it is not beyond their limits.

But can they do it against India spinners overcoming these conditions is the lingering question. And if they do, in some ways, this would be even sweeter than the ODI world cup final; the odds are stacked here far more than it was in 2023.

Title: India vs Australia Champions Trophy: Ravi Shastri backs four-spinner formula for semi-final in Dubai

Content:
With the Rohit Sharma led Indian team scoring a 44-run win over New-Zealand in their last group match in Dubai on Sunday, India will now be facing world champions Australia in the first semi-final at Dubai on Tuesday. With India opting for four spinners in the form of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy, it was Chakravarthy who picked up five wickets against New Zealand on Sunday. Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri believes Indian management should stick with the formula against Australia.
“The square is a little tired at the moment, people have run on the pitch that is going to be used the day after, so the spinners will again come into play. So if you bat first, put anything over 240-250, it’s going to be very competitive in a big game like a semi-final,” said Shastri after the match, talking with official broadcasters.
Chakaravarthy, who did not play in the first two matches including India’s opening match against Pakistan, had made his ODI debut against England last month. The 33-year-old picked his first fifer in ODI cricket on Sunday as he took wickets of Will Young, Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner and Matt Henry playing his part in New Zealand collapse. India had opted to drop pacer Harshit Rana and the Indian spinners bowled 37.3 overs in the match and picked up a total of nine wickets. With world champions Australia playing their first match in Dubai in this Champions Trophy, former Indian selector Kris Srikkanth believes playing four spinners is a ‘brilliant idea’.
“I don’t understand, why do you need Harshit Rana? What wrong did Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy do? Playing four spinners is a good idea, it’s actually a brilliant idea. The opponents do not know what to do. Australia have a pretty good batting line-up but even they’ll struggle against this Indian spin unit. Varun will spin a web around the Aussies.” Srikkanth said on his Youtube channel Cheeky Cheeka.
Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin had earlier criticised India’s move to select five spinners in the final squad. “What I don’t understand is the number of spinners we are taking to Dubai. Yeah I understand that we take three or four spinners for a tour. But five spinners in Dubai? I don’t know. I think we are one spinner too many if not two,” Ashwin had said on his Youtube channel ‘Ash ki Baat’.

Title: ‘This is not our home’: Rohit Sharma rubbishes talks of India having added advantage of playing all Champions Trophy matches in Dubai

Content:
With a lot of controversy erupting over India playing all its Champions Trophy matches in Dubai with many former player stating that the Men in Blue have an advantage of acclimatizing with the conditions, skipper Rohit Sharma on Monday rubbished the claims. Rohit said that the pitch had thrown up different challenges for his team too, saying that Dubai wasn’t their home ground.
“Every time, the pitch is giving you different challenges. The three matches that we played here, the pitch has behaved differently. This is not our home, this is Dubai. We don’t play so many matches here, and this is new for us too,” Rohit said during the pre-match press meet ahead of the semifinal against Australia.
He gave an example of the match against New Zealand on Sunday where the team needed to adjust to the pitch.
“We saw that when the (New Zealand) bowlers were bowling, it was swinging a little bit. We did not see it in the first two games when our bowlers were bowling. In the last game, we did not get to see that much spin, today there was a bit of it. So, there are different things happening on every surface. So, it is not like we know what is going to happen on this pitch and what is not going to happen,” he said.
“There are four or five surfaces that are being used here. See, I don’t know which pitch is going to be played in the semifinals. But whatever happens, we will have to adapt and see what is happening and what is not. And we will play on that,” he added.

India will face Australia in the 1st semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday while South Africa take on New Zealand in Lahore on Wednesday in the second semifinal.

Content:
India skipper Rohit Sharma on Monday said that they are going to approach the semifinal match against Australia just like they did in the last three matches in the Champions Trophy, dismissing that there’s any added pressure. India have a pretty dismal record against the Australians when it comes to ICC knockout encounters with the Men in Blue last defeating the Aussies in the 2011 World Cup quarterfinals.
“Look, they are a great opposition to play against. All we had to do is what we have been thinking about the last three games and we have to approach that game in a similar fashion. We understand the opposition and how they play and stuff like that,” Rohit said in the pre-match press conference.
“We will expect some nervy times as well in the middle. But that is how the game is being played these days. And you are talking about the semifinal. Obviously, the pressure will be on both teams to win that game,” he added.
Australia have come into the tournament without big names such as Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis but Rohit does not think that will affect their performance.
“But I think the more and more we focus on what we need to do as a group, as a player, as a batting unit, as a bowling unit, that helps us a lot. Australia has been such a great team over the years. So, we will expect some fight back,” he said.

“So, I think it is important for us to just keep focusing on what we need to do, keep doing our things and keep doing those things right. And then the result will come if we keep doing the things that we are supposed to,” he said before signing off.

Content:
Kolkata Knight Riders on Monday named Ajinkya Rahane as the team’s captain for the forthcoming IPL 2025 season. All-rounder Venkatesh Iyer was named as the defending champions’ vice-captain as IPL season is slated to begin on March 22.
The 36-year-old Rahane marked a reunion with KKR after having previously featured for the side in the 2022 season. The Mumbaikar was snapped up for Rs 1.5 crore during the IPL 2025 Mega Auction in November 2024. Rahane had a prolific domestic season with Mumbai, leading them to the Irani Cup and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy titles.
Rahane was at his prolific best in the SMAT T20s and topped the batting charts, smashing 469 runs in eight innings, averaging 58.62 with a 164.56 strike rate and five half-centuries. Meanwhile, Venkatesh was released to the pool ahead of the mega auction but received a whopping Rs 23.75 crore bid from KKR, making him the third-most expensive Indian player in the league.
Making the announcement, Venky Mysore, CEO of KKR said, “We are delighted to have someone like Ajinkya Rahane, who brings his experience and maturity as a leader. Also, Venkatesh Iyer has been a franchise player for KKR and brings a lot of leadership qualities. We are confident that they will combine well as we start the defense of our title.”
Accepting the leadership role, Rahane said, “It’s an honour to be asked to lead KKR, which has been one of the most successful franchises in the IPL. I think we have an excellent and balanced squad. I look forward to working with everyone and taking up the challenge of defending our title.”

Title: Ravi Shastri on Varun Chakravarthy: ‘It’s right time to unleash him’

Ravi Shastri lauded Team India’s decision to bring Varun Chakravarthy in the playing XI. The 33-year-old mystery spinner picked up five for 42 in India’s 44-run win over New Zealand in the final group A match in Dubai on Sunday.
“Very impressed with him (Chakravarthy), and full marks to the think tank and the team management for making the right choice because he’s someone who will get you wickets in the middle overs.
“It’s the right time to unleash him. They brought him into the side; he’s got a five-wicket haul, and I think he’s there to stay,” former head coach Shastri said in an ICC video posted on Instagram.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
“If you see his current form, and I always believe in current form – it’s vital and when you look at his body language, his self-confidence and his own ability and when you look at oppositions like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa that are left in this tournament, not many sides have played too much of him or seen enough of him.”
Shastri also suggested that India should retain the playing XI against Australia in the semifinal.
“I think I would go with the same eleven now because the turnaround time is less than 48 hours. The square is a little tired at the moment; people have run on the pitch that is going to be used the day after, so the spinners will again come into play,” said Shastri.
Varun Chakravarthy had credited his success to the senior Indian players in the team.
“The senior players helped me and, as the game went on, I felt better,” Chakravarthy said after the match.
“I am not a big turner (of the ball) but if you bowled in the right areas, there was help from the surface.”
India won all three group games and will play Australia in the first semifinal on Tuesday, also in Dubai.
New Zealand faces Group B winner South Africa in the second semifinal on Wednesday in Lahore, Pakistan.

Title: Varun Chakravarthy: ‘How I construct an over in T20I is totally different compared to the 50-over format’

Content:
India spinner Varun Chakravarthy opened up about how he bowls differently in the ODIs in comparison to T20Is and also explained the minute changes, he has made in his variations. Varun Chakravarthy registered 5 for 42 as India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in the Champions Trophy to top group A.
the thing that I don’t bowl is not right, because I do bowl all my variations, but in T20 I build my over differently, the way of sequencing different balls is different and in ODI it is different, so that’s why they don’t feel that I don’t bowl all the variations, but I do bowl all the variations.
“In T20s, my sequencing of balls as in how I construct an over is totally different compared to the 50-over format. I was able to figure it out when I played the last two years in the Vijay Hazare Trophy,” he told reporters.
“It really helped me to understand when I can bowl my incoming delivery or outgoing delivery or the straighter one or the top spin. It is completely different from what I do in the T20s,” he said.
Chakravarthy, who replaced rested Harshit Rana in the playing eleven, differed from captain Rohit Sharma, who has said that the spinner don’t even shows his variations to the Indian batters at the nets. He said: “The thing that I don’t bowl is not right, because I do bowl all my variations, but in T20 I build my over differently, the way of sequencing different balls is different and in ODI it is different, so that’s why they don’t feel that I don’t bowl all the variations, but I do bowl all the variations.”
When coaxed about the number of variations he possessed, the 33-year-old said: “Sir, basically the ball goes inside, outside and goes straight, so you can keep it that way, but there are minute changes that you can do with that also.
“That minute changes depends on the pitch totally and as I told you, one going away, one coming in and one that goes straight, so you can have some certain variations with that, it depends on the batsmen and depends on the time of when you bowl, as in how the ball is, if it’s very old you can try certain variations, yeah, all those things.”
The  Dubai International Cricket Stadium, pitch had considerable assistance for spinners, but Chakravarthy said “It was not a rank turner which people were projecting it to be.”
“But definitely it was holding on a bit, and it was deviating a little bit just to create the doubt.
“So, basically, you had to play around it. I would also dedicate my five wickets to the other bowlers as the way they bowled helped me pick wickets,” he noted.
“It is a patience game. You just need to wait on such slow wickets as the ball doesn’t turn fast. So, you need to wait,” he said.

Title: Varun Chakravarthy on his different career paths: ‘My dreams were all being an architect and making movies’

Varun Chakravarthy is a later bloomer, which is rare in Indian cricket. On Sunday, Varun Chakravarthy took 5 for 42 and helped India beat New Zealand by 44 runs at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. It was Varun’s first five-wicket haul in only his second one-day international.
The 33-year-old has picked up cricket when he was 26. At the press conference in Dubai, he has opened up about his different career paths.
“So, I started cricket very late, pretty late, when I was 26 I started cricket, so before  that my dreams were all building, being an architect and making movies,” he told reporters.
“I’ve had different career paths, so it has been different, after 26 is what I started dreaming about cricket and all those things are happening, so yeah, it’s been good right now,” he said.
Chakravarthy was tough to handle for the lower order, taking four wickets across six overs in his latter spell to reach the five-for milestone – the earliest for an Indian bowler in ODIs.
The Indian spinner maintained that the Dubai pitch was double paced but it was not a rank turner.
“So it was not a rank turner as such, which people were projecting it to be, but definitely it was holding on a bit and it was deviating a little bit just to create the doubt,” he said.
“Basically you had to play around it. I would dedicate my five wickets to the other bowlers also, the way they bowled on the other side helped me pick wickets in this set,” he said.
Varun was the last entrant to India’s Champions Trophy squad. He replaced opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and the Tamil Nadu bowler credited to his performance in the T20I series against England, where he scalped 14 wickets in five matches.
“I think so, yeah, because my T20 series went well, probably they thought that the pitches in Dubai might be slower and I might be of some use for the team and that was the thinking behind it and yeah, it has worked this match,” he said.

Title: India’s familiarity with conditions helped as spin quartet put us under pressure: Matt Henry

Content:
New Zealand pacer Matt Henry said India’s familiarity with the conditions here helped them pick a suitable bowling unit as their spin quartet, particularly Varun Chakravarthy, kept his side under constant pressure during the Champions Trophy match here.
India, who are playing all their matches in Dubai, fielded Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel against the Kiwis here on Sunday during their 44-run victory in the final Group A match.
“I think, obviously, the way to have four frontline spinners was a really effective way to play. I think having that luxury of knowing (conditions)…they played to the conditions beautifully. That was probably the challenge for us,” Henry said in the post-match press conference.
“We knew that they were going to play the four spinners. They bowled beautifully. They read the situation and the conditions well. Yeah, unfortunately, we couldn’t get across the line.” Chakravarthy was the most impressive among the four spinners, taking a five-wicket haul (5/42) as India set up a semifinal clash with Australia.
“He (Chakravarthy) bowled beautifully, didn’t he? I think he showed his skill, the way he turned the ball both ways, he could bowl pace. They were able to put us under pressure right throughout,” Henry said.
“He extracted turn and pace and he just, to be on a match winning performance like that, to be able to create pressure and I suppose that’s what they did in tandem.”
However, Henry was delighted to see New Zealand pacers putting India under pressure early, and he wants to replicate that against South Africa in the semifinals.
India were reeling at 30 for three at one stage before Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel mounted a rescue act.
“I think the key is adapting. It’s something we talk about as a fast-bowling group — reading conditions and trying to get the opposition to take tough options (to score) and we managed to do that even in the power play here,” he said.
“I think if we can keep doing that, we can take wickets. If you can take wickets throughout, especially throughout that middle, it makes a massive difference at the back end.
“Moving forward, we’ll take our learning from here and we’ll apply them back in Lahore (vs SA).”

Title: Axar Patel explains what makes Varun Chakravarthy a tough customer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/axar-patel-explain-what-makes-varun-chakravarthy-a-tough-customer-9865547/
Content:
Axar Patel hailed Varun Chakravarthy, who picked his maiden five-wicket haul in the ODIs against New Zealand in the last match of the Group A in the ongoing Champions Trophy. Varun Chakravarthy picked up 5 for 42 in his spell.
“Credit goes to him. The T20 WC (2021) was not a good experience for him. But after that he has come back and his mental skill shows how ready he is,” Axar told reporters in the mixed zone.
“I think he is carrying forward his performances in T20s to ODIs,” he said.
Axar also explained why Varun Chakravarthy is a tough customer to face.
“It is very difficult to read from his hand. And the pace with which he bowls is very difficult. So, I think, if a batter misses (the line), there is a higher chance of getting out. He is fast in the air also,” Axar said.
In the recent matches, the team management has promoted Axar Patel to No 5. The southpaw has not disappointed. In the England series, he scored a fine fifty in Nagpur then backed it up with an unbeaten 41 in Cuttack.
Against New Zealand, Axar walked in when India were reeling at 30 for 3. Axar dropped his anchor and put on a solid 98-run stand for the fourth wicket with Shreyas Iyer.
“When I get an opportunity, I try to bat based on the situation. But now, the approach has changed. Earlier, I used to come down and had to make runs quickly. Now, I know that there are more batsmen behind me, so I can play accordingly.
“I know that I have a lot of time. It depends on the requirement of the team as well and if I feel that I have to attack the spinner, I play accordingly like I had a partnership (a 98-run fourth wicket stand with Shreyas Iyer) in this match (vs NZ), and we could have a good total,” he said.

Title: Shreyas Iyer shows the importance of a No 4 batsman: Ambati Rayudu

Content:
Former India batter Ambati Rayudu showered praise on Shreyas Iyer and said the right-handed batter showed the importance of a No 4 in the batting line-up.
India got off to a poor start – Rohit Sharma was out caught for 15, while Matt Henry trapped in-form Shubman Gill lbw for two. It became 30/3 as Virat Kohli was caught at backward point for 11 when Glenn Phillips took a sensational one-handed flying catch.
Shreya Iyer came to India’s rescue as he put on 98 runs off 136 balls for the fourth wicket with Axar Patel. Patel scored a calm 42 off 61 balls, further strengthening his position as a reliable middle-order batter.
At the other end, Iyer batted in a different style, biding his time and curbing his naturally aggressive instinct. He reached 50 off 75 with four fours. He hit two sixes after that and started taking more risks which led to his downfall. He was caught off a short delivery from Will O’Rourke in the 37th over. Iyer scored a gritty 79.
“The importance of a No. 4 batsman is evident here,” Ambati Rayudu told JioHotstar.
“You need someone to play such crucial innings when the top order fails, especially on challenging surfaces that are not easy to bat on.
“That’s where No. 4 and No. 5 become critical in an ODI game. Shreyas played an amazing innings, and his partnership with Axar Patel was crucial.
“The ease with which he batted on this pitch was remarkable.
“He handled short balls well until he got out and played spin beautifully, using the crease and angles to his advantage. He picked the pace of the ball much better than many others in the Indian lineup.
“It was an unbelievable knock, and he’s been a champion at No. 4. We don’t talk about him enough, but he has had a great impact on this Indian side.”

Title: Cooper Connolly replaces Matt Short in Australia’s Champions Trophy squad

Content:
Australia have included spin-bowling allrounder Cooper Connolly in their CHampions Trophy squad to replace injured opener Matt Short, who was ruled out due to quad injury.
The 21-year-old Connolly, who made his ODI debut in England last year, was initially named as a travelling reserve for the tournament
“The Event Technical Committee of the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 has approved Cooper Connolly as a replacement for Matthew Short in the Australia squad,” ICC said in a statement.
“Twenty-one-year-old Connolly, who has played three ODIs, was named as a replacement after Short was ruled out due to an injury to his left quadriceps.”
Australia will have to look for a new opener, when they will lock horns against India in the first semi-final of the Champions Trophy.
“I think we saw tonight he wasn’t moving very well. I think it’s probably going to be too quick between games for him to recover,” Smith had told Prime Video.
Australia have another spare opener in Jake Fraser-McGurk, but that would leave them short of a bowling option. This could tempt the side to bring in Connolly, whose left-arm spin could be an important asset to have in Dubai.
Updated Australia squad: Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Spencer Johnson, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Adam Zampa, Cooper Connolly.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025: Kiwis done, Aussies next for Indian spin quartet
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-2025-kiwis-done-aussies-next-for-indian-spin-quartet-9865274/

What New Zealand suffered on Sunday could well torment Australia on Tuesday.
Kiwi captain Mitchell Santner, a man of few words, admitted that New Zealand were “squeezed by spin” after Varun Chakravarthy came off the bench to form a quartet of tweakers even as his five-wicket haul helped India claim a 44-run win in the final league match of the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai.
Australia, watching India’s strangulation of their neighbours, will realise that bagging the World Cup and the Champions Trophy at the same time might not be particularly easy. More pointedly, the Indian spinners won’t allow them to saunter away with another title. Watching New Zealand being cut down to size while chasing a target of 249, a few demons would have already cropped up in Aussie minds.
With Dubai filled to the brim with vocal Indian fans, India showed their might as a terrific white-ball unit which, after missing out on winning the World Cup, has gone on to reinvent itself as an even more formidable outfit that could be hard to overcome in any conditions.
The win was as good as any near-perfect outing that they had during the memorable run to the World Cup final on home soil in 2023. More importantly, having succumbed on a similar slow pitch in the World Cup final and later to Sri Lanka in Colombo, the win against New Zealand will give India enough confidence that with good depth in batting and bowling, they can now overcome such conditions — with spinners as the enforcers.
Having brushed aside Bangladesh, Pakistan and now New Zealand — on the most challenging of pitches they have faced so far in this Champions Trophy — India will now resume the much-revered rivalry against Australia in the semi-final. Although Rohit Sharma & Co kicked them out of the T20 World Cup last year, this knockout outing against Australia provides a perfect setting to avenge November 19, 2023, in Ahmedabad.
Though the conditions in Dubai will remind Australia of the ones they aced in the World Cup final, it will be India which will take the field as firm favourites on the back of having a spin attack that is looking hard to score off with each passing match. Varun was near-unplayable on Sunday. That New Zealand, who were posting totals in excess of 300 during their stay in Pakistan, managed to just surpass 200 this time, points to the task that the world champions have ahead of them.
“Very important for us to finish on a high,” skipper Rohit said about the win. “It is going to be a good game. Australia have a rich history of playing well in ICC tournaments. It will be a great contest, looking forward to that. We have to be focused on what we need to do on that day. Looking forward to that, hopefully we can stitch one towards us,” he said.
Never mind that this was a dead rubber, it was the game India had wished for ahead of the semi-finals. On a day when India took the field with just one front-line pacer in Mohammed Shami with Harshit Rana making way for Varun, their well-thought out spin strategy was backed by a fool-proof performance under lights.
To put matters in context, in the afternoon, which is considered the most challenging time to face spinners, India’s batsmen had gone at over 5 runs per over against the Kiwi tweakers.
So it wasn’t as if the conditions were tailor-made for them. With the pitch being slow, they had to be patient and the four — Varun, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja — did precisely that. On this pitch, more than the wickets, it is the dot balls that build pressure. So in the 38.3 overs they bowled between them, the Indian spinners sent down 128 dot balls (21.2 overs) mainly in the middle overs, which brought wickets at regular intervals.
From the moment India picked as many as five spinners in the squad for the slow conditions in Dubai, there was plenty of speculation about whether they are carrying one too many. On Sunday, the surface gave enough validation for their selection, and the eleventh-hour decision to include Varun – a spinner with minimum experience in the 50-over format – could, after all, make a huge difference.
Having made his ODI debut against England, Varun warmed the bench in the first two matches as India started with their three left-arm spinners. On pitches where they have had to be patient, in search of wickets in the middle overs, how long could they keep Varun on the bench was a question that was getting louder. So instead of throwing him at the deep end in the semi-finals, India played him here, and it proved to be a masterstroke.
With Jadeja and Axar giving nothing away with their accuracy, New Zealand had to go after Kuldeep and Varun. Doing so against both is fraught with risk and it was Varun who benefitted the most, picking up his maiden five-wicket haul as they outbowled their Kiwi counterparts.
After losing their top three in the first Powerplay, India made a strong comeback through Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel. In their preparations, they have gone about in search of controlled aggression, and they put that to good use here. Apart from treating the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner with respect, India went after Michael Bracewell and Rachin Ravindra in search of quick runs. If not for Matt Henry’s five wickets and an electric fielding performance from New Zealand, India’s total would have been much more than 249 for nine.

Title: From T20 World Cup to ICC Champions Trophy – Varun Chakravarthy’s career comes full circle at the same venue
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/varun-chakravarthy-career-full-circle-champions-trophy-t20-wc-9864959/
Content:
In November 2021, after a wicketless outing against Scotland in The T20 World Cup here, Varun Chakaravarthy walked away never to be seen in India colours, till October 2024.
As he took the field at the venue again on Sunday, he felt nervous. He may have cemented his spot in India’s T20 side on the back of strong showings in the IPL, but in ODIs there have been a lot of doubts – whether he would be able to retain the same mystery, will he be able to bowl impactful spells when batsmen have time to see him off.
Through the course of the evening, Varun will go about answering every single one of those questions and also vindicate his inclusion in the squad that came at the expense of a batting talent like Yashasvi Jaiswal.


A post shared by ICC (@icc)
When India’s think tank assembled in January to pick the provisional Champions Trophy squad, they had spent a considerable time pondering whether to include Varun or not. To back up his exceptional numbers in T20s, Varun had shown in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that he isn’t just a shortest-format bowler. But without an ODI cap to his name, taking an inexperienced spinner for an ICC event was seen as a gamble. However, as Varun went about troubling England in the T20Is, and with Kuldeep Yadav struggling for rhythm, they eventually turned to the 33-year-old.
His comeback to the national fold has been nothing short of a dream run, which even he wouldn’t have fancied writing in a movie script when he was actively pursuing to be a film-maker seven years ago. But his life and career has taken more sharp turns than his deliveries that continue to be hard for batsmen to decode.
When India picked Varun for the Champions Trophy, the only question was when and against whom they would unleash him. That moment finally came against New Zealand in a dead rubber, where it also provided Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir a live demonstration of where Varun stands in the ODI format. Unlike England batsmen, who just tried to slog him, New Zealand would be an ideal line-up for Varun to challenge himself. Moreover, with his inclusion, India had only more to gain as apart from strengthening their attack, it helped Rohit manage the workload of his seamers ahead of Tuesday’s semi-final.
What India got in the end was a pleasant headache going into the clash against Australia. With a four-pronged spin attack causing all sorts of problems, Rohit and Gambhir will go to bed on Sunday night with an important question: Whether to play four spinners or go back to the three-two combo, and if so, who to leave out? Dropping Varun now looks out of question.
For Varun, this was the night he had been waiting for. Off the first ball he bowled, he conceded a boundary, and appeared a bit nervous in the first spell. “The first spell of mine, I was a little nervous because the previous things, the emotions and whatever happened in the last three years before in this ground, were all playing in my mind. I was trying to keep it down, control it. Virat (Kohli) bhai, Rohit and even Hardik (Pandya), they were telling me ‘calm down, calm down’. They were coming and talking to me. That really helped,” Varun said.
The first spell, which included the wicket of Will Young, wasn’t his best by any means, but still he had figures of 5-0-16-1. It was a night when he had to be patient as the New Zealand batsmen were prepared to see him off. But what helped Varun, apart from the conditions, was that, in Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja, he had two spinners to pile on the pressure at the other end. Varun has the armoury to feed off the pressure created by them.
In T20s, Varun knows the sequence of deliveries he is lined up to bowl on the night. He is as meticulous as one can get. But in ODIs, he had to space out the wicket-taking deliveries and find if they bring him the same success. Playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy helped him to a large extent.
“My sequencing of balls, as in how I construct an over, is totally different compared to the 50-over format. And that I was able to figure out when I played the last two years in Vijay Hazare. And it really helped me to understand when I can bowl my incoming delivery or outgoing delivery or the straighter one or the top-spin, whatever it is. That gave me a sense of awareness of when to bowl what, it is completely different from what I do in T20s,” Varun said.
In the second spell, Varun would reap rewards for his patience. When he came on to bowl, the required rate was over a run-a-ball. It provided an opportunity to be lethal and he grabbed it with both hands, removing Glenn Phillips and Michael Bracewell in successive overs to kill the chase before taking out Mitchell Santer and Matt Henry to complete a five-wicket haul.

“It is a patience game. You just need to wait it out – in such slow wickets, the ball doesn’t turn fast. If it’s your day it happens to you,” Varun added.

Title: IND vs NZ Rollercoaster: Varun slides into direct contention, Phillips takes a stunner & Rohit’s pull needs a rethink

Content:
Has Varun Chakravarthy powered himself to earning a spot In the semifinal and maybe beyond? Ravi Shastri roared: “What he’s done is that he has put his hand up now for a spot in the semifinal in the playing XI, because the pitches will be the same, he has been outstanding tonight. Well more headaches for the think-tank and selectors.” With his figures of 5/42, Varun has almost definitely sealed his spot to take on the Aussies in Dubai on Tuesday.
Earlier though amidst his flipper and top spinner variations, while aiming at the stumps, there was a tiny slice of luck. And he had Michael Gough to thank. When the English umpire gives a decision on field, rarely has it been overturned in recent times. But he made a rare mistake on Sunday in Dubai when he gave Michael Bracewell out LBW against Varun Chakravarthy. He got the tough part right, that the ball first hit the pad and not the bat. But Varun’s delivery was angling away and later, ball-tracking showed it was missing the stumps. Bracewell hadn’t reviewed it (perhaps because it was Gough who gave it out, can’t be sure). But that dismissal got Ravi Shastri broaching the Varun dilemma, and announcing the mystery spinner’s arrival.

It was a free hit for Will Young in the fourth over of the run-chase. Hardik Pandya bowled a full length delivery that was miscued and the ball went high up in the air, but it was evident it didn’t have enough legs to go to the boundary. India were about to get away with a freebie with minimal damage. But Varun Chakravarthy at mid on had other ideas. There was no reason for him to go for the catch, he just had to wait for the ball to bounce in front of him, gather it safely and throw it back. But, in a moment of bravado, Varun went for what would have been a toughie in the best of circumstances, his outstretched arms were nowhere near the ball, instead his feet were, and he ended up kicking the ball towards the boundary. A desperate scramble wasn’t enough to save the four. Hardik, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli all had the same reaction… Hand on face. To be fair to Varun, he has made considerable improvements in his fielding in recent times, as was evident during the recent England series, where his work in the outfield came for praise. This was a throwback, however, to Varun’s earlier days in the IPL where he wasn’t necessarily always the best fielder on display.

Before the match, Glenn Phillips was asked in the press conference about the incredible catches he takes. Jokingly, a reporter, wondered: ‘any particular glue stick you use?’ Phillips, the understated NZ cricketer that he is, said: “I think a great deal of luck comes involved. I wish I could say that I’ve got a special little glue tag that I use, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. If anything, my palms are more sweaty than anything else. Obviously comes down to a lot of hard work and doing the basics as much as I can and then sometimes luck just plays a good part in it.”
If it is luck, Phillips must be like Domino in the Deadpool movie. On Sunday in Dubai, he pulled off another stunner in the ICC Champions Trophy. This one that left Virat Kohli awestruck in his 300th ODI. The Indian star absolutely belted a square cut to a short ball wide outside offstump, and the ball seemed to be flying towards the boundary, but Phillips put in a dive like an eagle, and plucked the ball from behind his right shoulder. It was the second time he had done so in the tournament, the previous one coming against Pakistan when he flung himself to his left. “We kind of expect that from Glenn,” captain Mitch Santner had said back then. It has just become a habit for the world’s best fielder at the moment… but it makes your jaw drop everytime.

Rohit Sharma stepping out to break the shackles during the early phase of an innings is now expected. He’s experienced success and failure in equal measure. In the 2022 T20 World Cup semi final against England in Adelaide he played one of the ugliest across the line horizontal slap shots to Sam Curran and got away with it. Then there was that out-of-shape heave against Glenn Maxwell in the 2023 50-over World Cup final in Ahmedabad against Australia. A brilliant running catch by Travis Head ended his stay in the middle. Here Matt Henry and Kyle Jamieson were on the money, and Rohit donned the aggressor role early to try and set the tone. When Rohit gets it right, it is a feast for the eyes. He had already pulled Henry for a four in the first over and in the third he charged down the track to launch the New Zealand fast bowler over mid-on for a six. It was a daring shot, his hand-eye coordination clicking and anticipation excellent. The attacking approach has not worked in Test cricket for him recently, but with less movement in the air in white-ball cricket Rohit takes his chances. Rohit hasn’t set the stage on fire yet in the first Power Play during the Champions Trophy. A few balls later, Rohit was dismissed playing the pull shot to a ball when facing Jamieson. He was a little early into the shot and was caught at square leg. 15 runs off 17 balls. Live by the sword, die by the sword seems to be Rohit’s motto. With two must-win games around the corner, cameos also need to be converted into big runs.

When Glenn Phillips leapt to his right and plucked another stunning catch like he usually does, Virat Kohli had a stunned look on his face, and the crowd was silent in the Dubai International Stadium. Earlier, skipper Rohit Sharma fell to his favourite pull shot, getting caught at the square leg while in-form Shubman Gill was trapped in front by Matt Henry in the third over.
The score board read 30/3 in 6.4 overs, another collapse from Indian batting order against the Kiwis looked ominous as memories of the haunting semi-final from the 2019 Cricket World Cup started returning to the Indian fans. Chasing 240 in Manchester, the Indian top order was destroyed by Trent Boult and Matt Henry.
Rohit and Kohli were present then too, and the scoreboard had read 5/3 with Rohit nicking one behind, Kohli getting trapped in front, and Rahul nicking it off to Matt Henry. The only difference between both horrible starts is that the Indian middle order failed to save the day in 2019, but Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel stitched a partnership of 98 runs today to save the innings. Shreyas negotiated the spinners fairly well and even drove them out of the attack, not sparing William O’Rourke brought in to scare him with the short stuff.
– Pritish Raj
Hardik Pandya had used his flat, fast tennis forehand speed to pull a ball to the boundary just moments ago. There was savagery in the air and in his sinewy intent. So off he went on the off-site, twice trying to scythe-cut William O’Rourke past point. Glenn Philips had reached his 23rd catch in 49 matches with a peach of a one-hander. But Kane Williamson stationed there first cut off one of the hardest hit slashes at point as Hardik went muscling away. Not soon after, one was smacked right at Williamson’s ribs as his catching palms were jolted and the ball seemed to bounce off them and even hit the knee before rolling down. Crucially, he had absorbed the velocity of that strongly struck cut. He would respond like a Tom & Jerry cartoon, flapping his palms and leg, as if comically electrocuted. He smiled genially but was spotted next ball still trying to shrug off the impact.

None of any of this, however, could stop Williamson from diving full length to his left to send back Ravindra Jadeja next for a stunning catch. Kane better than Glenn? Maybe not quite. But certainly, they were India’s bane.

Title: Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma on Varun Chakravarthy’s performance against NZ – ‘It’s a good headache’

IND vs NZ Champions Trophy 2025: Rohit Sharma-led India made the call to bring in Varun Chakravarthy for the first time in the playing XI during the ICC Champions Trophy against New Zealand on Sunday, and the spinner responded with a player-of-the-match performance, picking up 5/42. And the Indian captain said that it is now a ‘good headache’ to have before the semifinal on Tuesday. Varun was brought in to the XI in place of Harshit Rana, with Rohit saying the pacer was rested for this match.
“Look, Varun brings something different, there’s no doubt about it. We wanted to see what he could offer, and he proved he has much to offer,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation when asked about the decision to draft in a fourth spinner into the playing XI. “Obviously, we got to think a little bit about what we want to do in the next game. It is a good headache to have. But yeah, Varun was excellent today. If he executes well, he’s very difficult to read.”

Earlier on commentary, after Varun dismissed Michael Bracewell, former India coach Ravi Shastri had said that the spinner from Tamil Nadu has made a strong case to be retained to play against Australia. “What he’s done is that he has put his hand up now for a spot in the semifinal in the playing XI, because the pitches will be the same, he has been outstanding tonight. Well more headaches for the think-tank and selectors,” Shastri said.
India picked five spinners in their squad, with Varun a late addition after the original 15 was named without him. After his good performances in the T20 series against England, the 33-year-old was included in the ODI squad too, and then replaced Yashasvi Jaiswal for the CT squad. In slower conditions without dew in Dubai, Varun has vindicated that move and potentially sealed his place to take on Australia.

Title: Champions Trophy: Varun Chakravarthy takes 5 wickets as India defeat New Zealand by 44 runs to set up semifinal date with Australia

Varun Chakravarthy starred with 5 wickets for 42 runs as India defeated New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday and topped the Group A table to set up a semifinal date with Australia on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Group B table toppers South Africa will now face New Zealand in the second semifinal in Lahore on Wednesday.
Kane Williamson scored a fighting 81 but he was sent back by Axar Patel who along with Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja took 1 wicket apiece. India will be wary of their semifinal opponents who even with a depleted squad pose a threat. The last time these two sides met in an ICC 50-over tournament, Australia had walked out as the ODI World Cup 2023 champions in Ahmedabad.
Earlier, Shreyas Iyer produced a composed fifty under pressure but New Zealand, led by pacer Mark Henry, managed to stifle India to an under-par 249 for nine.
Iyer (79 off 98 balls) shared a well-paced 98 runs alliance with Axar Patel (42 off 61 balls) for the fourth wicket and Hardik Pandya (45 off 45) played a quick-fire innings towards the end to help India survive a top-order meltdown.
Henry (5/42) was the most successful bowler for New Zealand, who also made an impact with their terrific fielding.
It was a slightly different situation for Iyer as in the last few matches, the top three batters had given him the cushion of runs.
It had enabled him to bat with some degree of freedom in those matches. But here he had to build the innings from the scratch and he did that job with perfection while making fifty off 75 balls with a single off Rachin Ravindra.
The natural flair was on show on occasions as Iyer once lofted pacer Will O’Rourke for a six over long one and Axar gave him excellent company on a rather slow pitch.

But Axar departed against the flow of the game when his attempt to scoop Ravindra over short fine leg ended in the hands of Kane Williamson.
A century was there for the taking for Iyer but a feeble pull off O’Rourke was gobbled by up Young inside the covers.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: New Zealand pacers flourish on spin-friendly track
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-new-zealand-pacers-ind-vs-nz-9864798/
Content:
Of the three matches played here, the pitch for the India-New Zealand game was by far the toughest the batsmen had encountered. On a pitch that offered 4.5 degrees of turn – the most in the three fixtures so far — India posted the highest total of the tournament at this venue as their game plan against the New Zealand spinners worked.
Yet as India walked back with 249/9 on board despite acing their match-up against spinners, picking 5.12 an over, there was a sense of disbelief as to how they didn’t get more. What prevented them from getting a total above par on this surface was the combination of Matt Henry (5/42) and an exceptional fielding performance which saw Glenn Phillips and Kane Williamson convert half-chances into catches that left India stunned.
With the surface being on the slower side in the afternoon, Rohit Sharma lost another toss – the last time he won one was in the semi-final of the 2023 World Cup – and were made to bat first. While it definitely offered an opportunity to test how their batting goes about setting a target, should India field first again in the semi-finals on Tuesday, it is bound to test their bowlers’ workload.
In the build-up to the game, all the talk had been around how India’s batsmen would counter the Kiwi spinners, who have caused all sorts of problems in recent times. With four spin bowling options in the Kiwi ranks, India’s batting group would definitely be happy with the way they dealt with them as they scored 128 runs in the 25 overs delivered by Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell and Rachin Ravindra. A run rate of 5.12 against spinners on this pitch was a vindication of how effective their approach was. Despite managing only six boundaries and three sixes off the trio, they used strike-rotation to keep the dot balls to 66 off the spinners.
By contrast, the New Zealand speedsters offered a stiff challenge. They gave 120 runs in 25 overs, picking up 7 wickets. In a three-pronged seam attack, Henry may be the most lethal with his speed and movement. And in Kyle Jamieson and Will O’Rourke, they have two bowlers who stand at 6’8” and 6’6” respectively and are capable of getting the ball to move. That their attack – which also includes Lockie Ferguson – who is out injured – has repeatedly troubled Indian batsmen isn’t new. But they did so in conditions that were not pace-friendly.
With a silken-smooth action, much like his idol Shane Bond, Henry has troubled India in the past –
famously at an overcast Manchester at the 2019 World Cup. In completely different conditions with no cloud cover, he still managed to generate movement in the air and off the pitch. Though Rohit tried to go after him when he landed short of a good length, when he pitched on a good length, he kept testing both the openers before nailing Shubman Gill with one that seamed in and trapped him plumb.
By the sixth over, Jamieson would get involved. On a slow surface, with pace on offer, Rohit went for a pull – the second time on the day – but this one, thanks to Jamieson’s height, bounced a bit more and lost a bit of pace as well once it landed. It hit the toe-end of the bat as Will Young gladly accepted the offering at square-leg.
Then came the first bit of brilliance on the field from Phillips who had already taken a blinder in the opening match to dismiss Mohammad Rizwan. This one wasn’t as spectacular, but was still acrobatic as he dived full-length to his right and caught it behind him to cut short Virat Kohli’s innings at 11 in his 300th ODI outing. Stationed at backward point when the seamers operated, he would throw himself to his left and right to prevent singles. When the spinners operated, he would move to the covers and cut down the angles to stop singles towards mid-off. Towards the end of the innings, he would run in from deep mid-wicket and plunge forward valiantly with the capacity crowd giving a round of applause for his effort.
It wasn’t just Phillips. When Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel were setting up a platform, it was Williamson who ended the 98-run partnership with a one-handed diving catch at fine-leg. Later on, wicketkeeper Tom Latham would take another fine catch when KL Rahul edged one off Santner. Then with Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja setting themselves for the final flourish, Williamson, now stationed at backward point, dived to his left full-length to catch the ball centimetres off the turf to the disbelief of the left-hander.

It was the story of India’s innings. Whenever they appeared to take full control of proceedings, New Zealand would come up with something special. In the end, when Pandya was in top gear, Jamieson would keep him in check with a clever mix of back-of-the-hand slower deliveries before conceding a 15-run over that spoiled his figures. But on this pitch, New Zealand walked back having given it their all.

Title: Champions Trophy: How Matt Henry removed Shubman Gill by targeting his one batting weakness
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-matt-henry-shubman-gill-dismissal-weakness-9864719/
Content:
It’s amazing really how Shubman Gill hasn’t managed to erase that one weakness in his batting for all these years: the slow weight transfer onto the front foot. Sunday afternoon provided yet another iteration of the deja-vu. New Zealand in particular have done it often before; Kyle Jamieson on at least two occasions, Tim Southee and this time it was Matt Henry. Other bowlers too have got him with the same ball — Kagiso Rabada, James Anderson and Mohammad Shami (in the IPL).
The television coverage has saturated our minds’ by now about what that good length is: say 6 to 8 metres from the batsman’s stumps. Matt Henry’s delivery landed on a length, say closer to the 8m and skidded in. Anything closer to him, Gill has no issues. Even closer to the 6m mark from his stumps, he has relatively less issues as he lets his wonderful hands do the jailbreak for him. Henry’s delivery skidded in a bit from that length and Gill was on the move, trying to work it around his front pad and was unsurprisingly trapped in front.
It primarily stems from his tiny stride out; calling it a stride is an overstatement, a short step out. And that primarily stems from his childhood days of developing his game on cement tracks. On cement, the backfoot becomes an instinctive play, and the front foot is something to be worked on. The muscle memory is deeply set; and hence his back-foot game is stellar, his stand-up and punch game is a sizzler, but the in-between length has always posed him problems.


A post shared by ICC (@icc)
Batting is about transferring weight and being still when playing a shot. At the top level one needs to be strong on the back foot but still have the balance and skill to play under the eyes, and be in a position to transfer the weight forward.
Gill’s trigger is quite simple: he moves back a touch, opens his front foot a bit, and is loath to take a big stride out. As that one change can completely upset his entire set-up, his balance. It’s a tradeoff that batsmen like him accept when they change things. The things they do well might not be easy to achieve if they alter the way they move in the crease. Is it worth disrupting the technique built? Would this – let’s say leaning forward with a positive step or taking an initial movement out – disrupt the entire balance and affect all other areas of his game? Isn’t it better to manage this with the hands? And so he has ploughed on for years now.
It’s sort of a problem that once you see it as an observer, it becomes difficult to unsee. And we have seen it often with Gill. Even when the ball is relatively full, he doesn’t move forward that much. He can occasionally push his hands at the ball without actually transferring his weight forward, especially against pacers. It’s a potential area of weakness that good bowlers target on less bouncy surfaces. The key is to draw him forward as he likes to sit back on the back foot. Or around the crease. It helps him on pitches with bounce, as we saw in Australia in the past — though on the recent tour there he couldn’t convert his starts. However, that technique has created problems for him in England and elsewhere. New Zealand were one of the first to exploit that.
Not that he doesn’t know of course. “There are one or two important elements. Like your shoulder should be aligned towards the ball, you should be a little side-on while playing, you should be in a good position even if your feet are not moving that well. If you are positioned well in relation to the ball, you will manage… When we play in India, there isn’t that much bounce. Most deliveries stay low. That (reducing the shuffle) was one adjustment I made after talking to our batting coach. I felt I should restrict my initial movement a bit. The ball doesn’t swing much in India either, so the lesser the movement in your body, the better it will be for you,” Gill once told The Indian Express.
He “manages” with his hands, by letting them go in front of the body to meet the ball. It works as it did when Shaheen Afridi hurls it fuller. That Pakistan game actually did throw up similar cues. He had no issues with the back of length stuff from Haris Rauf nor the fuller stuff from Shaheen. It was Naseem Shah who coaxed out his cautious self with his in-between lengths, like Henry did. He managed to let his hands out and stab Naseem away. He tried that against Henry but couldn’t.
“As a player you should know what things you need to work on, and where the opposition is looking to get you out. If you know that, it becomes easier to tackle,” Gill had said. “I don’t make any big changes to my technique without talking to my father… In cricket, there is no technique that can be termed ‘out-proof.’” Clearly, he does see the weight transfer as an issue as he has tried to offset it by reducing his back-foot initial movements. Also, for a brief while in the past, he would stand with a noticeable lean-in of the front shoulder. So he has tinkered around.
And in the recent months, he has often used the walk down the pitch against such bowlers who hit that length. It has often worked, not just in those particular balls where he has walked, but the approach has put off a few bowlers who then have changed lengths in other deliveries. But on days like this, before he has got his aggressive instincts up and flowing, especially when very new to the crease, it’s a delivery that most good pacers should and often do go against him.

Undoubtedly, it’s a ploy that would be tried in the semifinal too. One can assume he would begin the walk-down-the track sooner there or try to get that front shoulder lean in that much more pronouncedly at the crease. It will come down to the first few overs, mostly within the first five. If he can hoodwink the seamers into thinking he has that area covered on the day, he will prosper.

Title: Ranji Trophy final: Sachin Baby and Co lost a nervy, mistake-filled title clash, but here’s how Kerala can shine in the future
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-kerala-can-shine-in-future-9864715/
Content:
At the presentation ceremony, Kerala captain Sachin Baby fired a friendly warning, turning his head towards Vidarbha cricketers: “You guys have beaten us in all three knockout stages. Next time, guys, we’ll beat you. We’ll give you a tougher time!”  The banter, finally, sprinkled some cheer on the face of Kerala’s downcast cricketers, hands wrapped over each other’s shoulders, collective in their passage of grief.
Commiserations and consolation flowed. Some of Vidarbha’s cricketers, had arms of comfort around the disconsolate Kerala counterparts. Vanquished in last year’s final, they could relate to their plight. Kerala players reciprocated with uneasy smiles, but the pain was evident in their hollow eyes.  What would pique them when they reflect on a memorable journey but with a heartbreak twist at the climax is the moments that they didn’t seize and the tactical naivety they betrayed in clutch junctures.
A big round of applause for Kerala 👏
They played some fantastic cricket and scripted history by making it to their first ever #RanjiTrophy Final 👌👌@IDFCFIRSTBank

From bestowing Vidarbha with the best of conditions to bat after winning the toss, to defensive field placings throughout the game, to instances of individual letdowns – like Sachin slog-sweeping two runs adrift of his century with the lead in the vicinity – and Akshay Chandran spilling a dolly of eventual centurion Karun Nair at first slip, Kerala let moments pass by with the passivity of nervous freshers.
Sachin owned up his moment of indiscretion. “As the leader, I’ll take the blame. My shot changed the momentum of the game. I wanted to be there for the team, and we were six down. wanted to be there till the end to get the lead. Wanted to have a lead of 100-plus if at all we got a lead. That would have made a difference,” he says. He still can’t put into words what went through his mind. “I was playing all along the ground till that moment, but then I don’t know what happened and why I played that shot. But that and the dropped catch of Karun were important moments of the game,” he says.

When the pain ebbs, coach Amay Khurasiya and Co would find the comforts of a resurgent season. It’s the first time Kerala had ever featured in a final; they were nerveless in the grind to the eventual destination, seeing out close games and surviving intense pressure; there is a sturdy base to string together a more competitive team for the future.
They could glean lessons too. Like the need to discover top-order hands who could consistently compose hundreds, so that the middle-order bulwarks, Salman Nizar and Mohammed Azharuddeen, could shine brighter. The pairs’ best years are yet to come. The rough edges of Rohan Kunnumal and Ahammed Imran could be polished and they could sparkle. Eden Apple Tom, only 19, could be groomed into a strike force of the future. Vidarbha coach Usman Ghani, who had trained him at the NCA was happily surprised by his improvement. “Some of his spells were really good, bowled at good pace and found movement. I was impressed with his development and the way he bowled,” he observes.
A condition-transcending spinner too could be high on the priority. Both Aditya Sarwate and Jalaj Saxena, 35 and 38, conveyed signs of creaking as well as their over-reliance on custom-made pitches of Thumba. Sarwate has lost much of the zip that propelled his sub-20 average. Saxena cannot sustain his incisiveness throughout a long spell. The spin cupboard in the state is thin, but if they could recruit one, like Saxena in his prime years, and invest in manufacturing one from age-group cricket, the title push in the coming years could be stronger.
Kerala should ensure that they are not one-season wonders, but that they are a certifiably progressing side, the curve shooting upwards, and it’s not a false dawn like it was in the 2017-18 season. The journey was orchestrated by the irrepressible new-ball duo of Basil Thampi and Sandeep Warrier. Both were lost in grooming and never scaled the heights they were touted to.

Then, Kerala cricket should remember they have endured harder matches and darker patches, and those overreacting to the final stumble must have forgotten both how poorly they have played at points in the past, and how well they have tended to rally and respond when they have been written off this season. The team deserves faith. “We would look to work on the positives we have achieved this year and hope to make the next big step in the game,” Sachin says.
There are no better teams to borrow optimism and belief than Vidarbha. Ploughing the Plate a decade ago, leaning heavily on imports to prop up their comeuppance, each blow has only made them stronger in their transformation from underdogs, to pretenders, to challengers and a certified superpower. Kerala’s next big challenge would be to reproduce in real life the friendly warning Sachin fired. And this would be the dream that fires Kerala next season.

Title: Champions Trophy | Tale of 2 catches: NZ fielders Glenn Philips and Kane Williamson help restrict India to 249/9

Before the match, Glenn Phillips was asked in the press conference about the incredible catches he takes. Jokingly, a reporter, wondered: ‘any particular glue stick you use?’ Philllips, the understated NZ cricketer that he is, said: “I think a great deal of luck comes involved. I wish I could say that I’ve got a special little glue tag that I use, but unfortunately, that’s not the case. If anything, my palms are more sweaty than anything else. Obviously comes down to a lot of hard work and doing the basics as much as I can and then sometimes luck just plays a good part in it.”
If it is luck, Phillips must be like Domino in the Deadpool movie. On Sunday in Dubai, he pulled off another stunner in the ICC Champions Trophy. This one that left Virat Kohli awestruck in his 300th ODI. The Indian star absolutely belted a square cut to a short ball wide outside offstump, and the ball seemed to be flying towards the boundary, but Phillips put in a dive like an eagle, and plucked the ball from behind his right shoulder.

Title: ‘Would like them to come up with an answer’: Sir Vivian Richards wants ICC response to Champions Trophy scheduling

Content:
Sir Vivian Richards said that the International Cricket Council (ICC) will have to provide answers on the confusion over the Champions Trophy schedule with both Australia and South Africa having to fly to Dubai in order to know who they’ll face in the respective semifinals. Australia flew to Dubai from Karachi late Friday night after their match against Afghanistan was washed out, a result that guaranteed them a semifinal berth. South Africa drubbed England by seven wickets to swell their points tally to five and boarded the Dubai-bound flight as toppers of Group B.
This was due to India playing all their matches in Dubai and their match against New Zealand on Sunday will decide whether Australia face them in the semis or if South Africa will take them on. The team which do not play India in the semis as well New Zealand will have to fly back to Pakistan
“People may have a point when they say that. I guess that’s due to politics — I don’t want to get into the politic side of things,” Richards said.
“But I believe the people who are responsible, in terms of the governing and the ruling of the game in itself which is the ICC, they’re the ones who I think got the problem. I would like them to come up with an answer, why? If they are the governing body of cricket, why is that happening at present? I honestly believe one of the things that can bring all of us together, fans and everyone, even enemies together, (is) sports,” he said.
With India playing all their matches of the competition in Dubai, the final will also be at the Dubai International Stadium provided Rohit Sharma’s team makes the summit clash.

Former England cricketers Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton had also recently said India have the advantage of not having to travel to the other venues.

Legendary player Sir Vivian Richards urged West Indies to learn from Afghanistan and re-establish themselves as a force in ODI cricket. The West Indies and Sri Lanka, both former world champions, have failed to qualify for the ongoing Champions Trophy with WI even failing to take part in the 2023 ODI World Cup in India.
“I’m just hoping that my West Indies team can take a leaf out of these guys’ book, because there is a passion and energy that the Afghanis have brought to the game,” Richards said.
“They haven’t been in the cricket world for so long as maybe some other teams around the world, but just their fighting spirit. To me, the ability to learn as the years go by, that would have given them the experience that’s needed in order for them to be where they’re at. When you can see Afghanistan in the Champions League, and the West Indies not, it means that Afghanistan is doing something right,” he added.
As compared to West Indies, Afghanistan have now become a decent force in the Asian region on the back of some consistent showing in ICC tournaments with the side eliminating England in the ongoing Champions Trophy while also making it to the semifinals of the 2024 T20 World Cup.
“In order for us to get ourselves back where we once were, it is going to take maybe not just the players, but individuals from the board, people who are in responsible positions,” Richards said.

“For them to believe that this is not just the players, but it takes people from the board to identify the things that may be missing, (as to) why we are not there. I feel very annoyed with the fact that the West Indies team, with such (a) huge legacy, is not in the Champions Trophy and it hurts. It makes me feel very, very sad, because we are much better than that,” he added.

On Sunday, Phillips pulled off another stunner in the ICC Champions Trophy. This one left Virat Kohli awestruck in his 300th ODI. The Indian star absolutely belted a square cut to a short ball wide outside offstump, and the ball seemed to be flying towards the boundary, but Phillips put in a dive like an eagle, and plucked the ball from behind his right shoulder. It was the second time he had done so in the tournament, the previous one coming against Pakistan when he flung himself to his left. “We kind of expect that from Glenn,” captain Mitch Santner had said back then. It has just become a habit for the world’s best fielder at the moment… but it makes your jaw drop every time.

Title: Virat Kohli 300 ODIs: Sunil Gavaskar on why Kohli is ‘Chancellor of the Indian Cricket University’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-300-odis-sunil-gavaskar-on-why-kohli-is-chancellor-of-the-indian-cricket-university-9864226/
Content:
IND vs NZ Champions Trophy 2025: Virat Kohli’s desire to constantly improve and wholehearted commitment to everything he does on and off the field is what sets his apart, said former India captain Sunil Gavaskar, on the occasion of the 36-year-old’s 300th One Day International for India.
Asked about Kohli’s longevity in the modern game and his evolution, Gavaskar said on Star Sports: “I think it’s the desire to be better than yesterday. He’s never satisfied with what he’s achieved and always wants to do more. The pride he shows playing for India is an honor and a privilege. There are millions who dream of playing for India. Whether it’s a test match, a 50-over game, or a T20 game, representing your country is every young kid’s dream and ambition. Keeping that ambition alive is key for Kohli wanting to excel in every game.”

Kohli is the seventh Indian cricketer to appear in 300 ODIs, joining Azharuddin, Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh in the elite club. Gavaskar went on to describe Kohli as the Chancellor of Indian cricket university.
“It’s not just about the runs he scores. Look at his commitment on the field—how he dives, returns the ball to the wicketkeeper or bowler, and tries to save runs for his team. That wholehearted commitment to India is crucial. That’s why his evolution from a learner to almost a professor of cricket is remarkable. He’s gone from student to teacher to, if I may add, the chancellor of the Indian cricket university. For younger players like Shubman Gills and Yashasvi Jaiswals, just sitting next to him and observing how he prepares is a great learning curve,” Gavaskar added.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Third title in seven years means Vidarbha no longer domestic upstarts

The revelry lasted the whole evening. Vidarbha’s euphoric cricketers gathered around the pitch, muttered prayers and kept the trophy at the centre of the 22-yard strip. Some broke down in the arms of their tearful parents, the farewelling Akshay Wakhare clung onto the giant ears of the trophy, tugging it close to his chest; sweets were distributed, feet were touched in reverence, Jamtha turned into a bubble of emotions.
The moment of victory was wrought hours ago. When the digital clock mounted beside the manual scoreboard flashed 2.15, the sun scorching down, Darshan Nalkande swiped Aditya Sarwate towards midwicket to complete his half-century. The long-awaited declaration arrived, and the moment of frenzy kicked in. Vidarbha declared at 375 for 9, and Kerala’s captain conveyed the message that they won’t dare the ludicrous task of chasing down 412 in less than 40 overs. The match was drawn and the hosts won on their first-innings lead.
The rest of Vidarbha’s players stormed into the ground to pile over Nalkande and Yash Thakur, before grabbing souvenir stumps and dancing in an impromptu huddle near the pitch. Wagging their stumps, they ran a lap around the stadium. The pain of losing last year’s final, at the hands of Mumbai, was exorcised as they held the trophy aloft for the third time in seven years.

The destiny of the game was a foregone conclusion, reducing the proceedings to the seriousness of an irrelevant postscript. It was akin to the credit-roll at the end of a movie, those watched from the corner of the eyes in the hustle to exit the theatre. The mass of names doesn’t register. The action that unfolded on Sunday would barely remain in the memory of the audience or the players, until the trophy-lifting moment knocked in.
A sense of ennui swept from the start. Vidarbha’s Karun Nair attempted a flurry of reverse-sweeps and contrived to get stumped in the end, adding only three runs to his overnight score of 132. The rest batted disinterestedly, even though the wickets of Wadkar and Harsh Dubey infused remote concerns of a Kerala retaliation. It did not manifest, as even Kerala had entered the field reconciled to an inevitable loss.
Exhausted after their longest campaign in a Ranji season, they wandered like somnambulists. The pangs of defeat had long sunk in, and it would remain a bittersweet season in their consciousness. Even Karun’s departure didn’t lift their punctured spirits, or poke the belief in miracles. The appeals were faint, the movements laborious, and the celebrations mere afterthoughts.
In contrast, excitement rippled in the stands, where relatives and friends of Vidarbha players waited for the team’s coronation. The chorus of claps were as loud as a few hundred pairs of hands could be. The mood before the day’s start was one of joviality rather than jeopardy, the Vidarbha faithful congregating not in hope but in expectation. The hard yards had been done on Saturday. This was the fun part. Songs and banners.
That winning feeling 🤗

The 2024-25 victory might not be the sweetest of their three Ranji conquests — nothing matches the euphoria of hoisting the trophy for the first time — but it could be the most satisfying one. It’s the tournament where they acquired invincibility; undefeated, outrightly victorious in eight of the 10 games. Had they pressed for a win on Sunday, they could have achieved it comfortably. But they didn’t resort to banal exhibitionism, flexing their muscles only when the situation demanded. The first-innings lead accomplished, they wanted to barricade every possible comeback route for Kerala.
Revealingly, it’s a juncture in their history that captures their journey from fairy-tale spinning underdogs to a genuine domestic powerhouse with resources, skills and attitude to boss any other side in the country. The nondescript side from the sun-parched Central Indian plains has more titles (3) than some of the more storied sides in Indian cricket’s map. Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Hyderabad have fewer trophies than them. En route, they have shed the ‘upstart’ tag that haunted them even in their back-to-back title-winning years. The argument that more celebrated sides are playing without their stars, turning up for the country, holds vacuous logic now.
Moulding cricketers for the country is the next organic rung in the evolutionary cycle. The campaign — a triumph of home-spun talents— has emitted encouraging signs in this regard. Although, Karun Nair’s contributions were immense and Dhruv Shorey chimed in with valuable knocks, the primary contributors were the triumvirate of youngsters from Nagpur. Yash Rathod, the bespectacled and compact left-hander, helmed the run-scoring charts with 960 runs at 53.33; Danish Malewar, flourishes of the wrists punctuating his game, rattled out 783 runs at 52.20; Harsh Dubey, the discovery of the edition, revealed his wondrous gifts to blend orthodoxy and modernity.
Rathod, 24, is the oldest among them, his teammates call him the “studious one.” He is always working on his batting, at the nets behind the ground when he is not batting or fielding. Or he could be seen locked in intense dissections of his dismissals with the video analyst. “It was our plan to blood youngsters and we were confident that they have the game to excel at this level. And as you have seen, they have all performed really well,” points out coach Usman Ghani, who, without any hesitation, termed this the best moment of his life.
Malewar is the youngest at 21, even though he exudes a frightening maturity in the middle. He is quiet and shy, until he starts talking about batting. “He is a keen student of the game, always wants to improve his batting and fitness, always looking to learn new things,” Karun would say.

Dubey, 22, is the “intelligent one”. “Hamara Ashwin hai,” screams a support-staff member. “He has a great awareness to bowl according to the conditions. He is a very smart cricketer, and I am sure he will reach great heights,” Ghani says.
Winning the Ranji Trophy was perhaps the first step in their journey to dizzying cricketing heights.

Title: Champions Trophy: Travis Head says Dubai conditions a bit more low-scoring, making the situation challenging

Travis Head was asked about the suboptimal travel arrangements, forcing both Australia and South Africa to travel to UAE with one team returning, should they be slotted for the semis against NZ, the vice captain said, it was a tricky situation but one they would deal with.
Acknowledging the difference in conditions between Lahore and Dubai, with the scheduling boggling the team’s preparation, Head stressed they would keep their heads about the unique scenario. “We’ll watch the next couple of days, stay relaxed and then get to work. I guess there’ll be two different scenarios where it could be two different conditions,” he was quoted as saying by Fox Cricket.

“Whether we go to Dubai and play there, which looks like it’s a little bit more difficult or more challenging pitch than is here (in Lahore). It’s a little bit more low-scoring. We’ll prepare as well as we can, so we’ll see how we go,” he added.
Earlier, South African batter Rassie van der Dussen had said the tournament scheduling gave India an effective home advantage without being the host nation, acknowledging the uneven playing field.
“If you can stay in one place, stay in one hotel, practice in the same facilities, play in the same stadium, on the same pitches every time, it’s definitely an advantage. I don’t think you have to be a rocket scientist to know that,” he had said straight-faced.
New Zealand effectively have the best scenario next to India, knowing when they have to play in sluggish Gulf conditions, with a certainty of travelling to Pakistan for their semis.

Jasprit Bumrah revealed what he asked Sam Konstas during their altercation in the fifth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
“Pata nahi isme to aapko kuch aur lag raha hoga, main to usse puch raha tha ki ‘sab theek hai? Mummy theek hai, ghar par sab theek hai? (‘I don’t know what you guys are thinking but I mainly asked him, ‘Is everything okay?’ Is your mother fine, is everything at home fine?’)” Bumrah said at a promotional event.
“Usne bola ‘haan theek hai’ to maine bola ‘Acha theek hai ab ball daal deta hoon.’ Aap logo ne kuch aur interpret kar liya hoga. I think udhar words nahi the to maybe miscommunication ho gaya hoga. (He said ‘Yes, it’s fine?’ to which I said ‘Now, I will bowl’. You guys must have interpreted it some thing else. I think the lack of words may have caused some miscommunication).
“Incidents like these happen when the game is close.
“We were wasting some time, they were trying to do it as well. We were trying to put some pressure.
“But, that’s not the best example. I am not angry all the time but sometimes, it happens,” he added.
During the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), Jasprit Bumrah who was on the receiving end of some unconventional shots from debutant Sam Konstas which included 2 sixes, said that he felt that in the initial stages he could have dismissed the Aussie 6-7 times in the first couple of overs.
“Interesting batsman (Konstas) as well and I always felt I was in the game, I never felt I am far away from a wicket. Initially I felt I could have got him out 6-7 times in the first two overs but that’s how cricket goes, some days it pays off, it looks good, some days if it doesn’t you might be criticising the same person,” Bumrah said in an interaction with Channel 7.
Bumrah has had one of his best years for the Indian team which has reflected in the fact that the pacer was adjudged the ICC’s Test Cricketer of the Year on Monday and was also named in the Test Team of the Year last week.

Title: Here’s who Ravindra Jadeja, Md Shami and Axar Patel picked as the most dangerous batsmen

Content:
While Jos Buttler might be out of the Champions Trophy, he still has a admirer in Ravindra Jadeja. In an Instagram video put out by ICC, Jadeja named Buttler and Glenn Maxwell as the most dangerous batters going around currently.
“Maxwell is a match winner for Australia,” Jadeja said in the original ICC video, while  identifying the Australian and England captain Jos Buttler as formidable match-winners.
Pacer Md Shami however picked impending storm, New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra, saying he liked his aggressive approach and shot-making ability. “I always like Ravindra because he is attacking in powerplay and his shot selection is good in these conditions,” Shami said.
Shot selection and ability to play shots around the ground in middle overs of opponents seemed to impress Indian bowlers who were often at receiving end of aggressive and enterprising batters from opposition ranks.

Strangely, Travis Head was still not acknowledged as someone who the Indian bowlers feared or who could pose a challenge to them, despite him being a constant thorn in their flesh.
Axar Patel, meanwhile, picked South African power-hitter Heinrich Klaasen, for his high impact in the middle order, even if India had defeated South Africa in the 2023 World Cup. “Heinrich Klaasen had a very good T20 World Cup and he plays shots all around the ground in middle overs,” Axar said.
India have made the semifinals of the Champions Trophy in Dubai, alongside New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, although the exact match up will only be known after the Ind vs NZ game starting in an hour and half’s time.
Klaasen had been resting out an injury and only surfaced against England. Rachin already has a century against Bangladesh while Maxwell hasn’t exactly been called upon to go berserk.

Australian great Matthew Hayden has backed Black Caps batting sensation Rachin Ravindra to score heavily in coming years, labelling him the complete package. After tailing off his commentary in the last match the Kiwis played against Bangladesh, with a “He did it at a canter, it didn’t look like he was even breaking a sweat,” Hayden proceeded to gush about the southpaw.

“The beautiful areas are his cover driving,” Hayden said describing him as a classical player. “He gets himself into incredible positions. He’s a very front foot player but he’s also able to rock back, use his height as an advantage and play square of the wicket.”
Hayden noted his proficiency against spin.
“He rotates the strike well and he’s got a good sweep shot and a good down the ground shot, so he’s the complete package in terms of strike-rate and scoring rate. He’s a player of the ages,” Hayden said.
New Zealand play their final pool match of the Champions Trophy against India in two hour’s time, and it will be a perfect faceoff between the two new-age batters, Shubman Gill and Rachin. Hayden too stressed that top order batsmen always dream of smashing tons at major ICC tournaments, such as the Champions Trophy and World Cups. Rachin had three centuries at the 2023 ODI World Cup in India and his Champions Trophy knock against Bangladesh (112 off 105), gave him the record of having more hundreds at ICC 50 over tournaments than any other Kiwi.
Shubman Gill, on the other hand, follows an illustrious list of Indian batters with ICC tournament centuries, but got started himself with a ton against Bangladesh.

Title: Virat Kohli’s 300th ODI: How Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni and other Indians fared in milestone match with Champions Trophy connection

Content:
India’s ace batter Virat Kohli is slated to play in his landmark 300th ODI during the Champions Trophy 2025 match against New Zealand in Dubai on Sunday. Kohli will achieve a world record of becoming the first player to feature in at least 300 ODIs, 100 Tests and 100 T20Is.
The former India captain will be the 22nd player to achieve the landmark and the first player in six years since Chris Gayle to feature in 300 ODIs. Kohli will be the seventh Indian to reach the landmark of 300 ODIs. Interestingly, four of the previous six players achieved the milestone match during a Champions Trophy campaign.
Mohammed Azharuddin’s 300th ODI
Azharuddin’s 300th ODI was marked during the inaugural Champions Trophy edition in 1998, then called the ICC Knockout Trophy. Playing Australia in Dhaka, Azharuddin would, however, fall for a three-ball duck to Damien Fleming but India would march to a respectable score on the back of Sachin Tendulkar’s 141. India won the quarter-final tie by 44 runs as Tendulkar chipped in with the ball too, claiming four wickets.
Sachin Tendulkar’s 300th ODI
Sachin Tendulkar’s 300th ODI fell during the rescheduled rain-marred 2002 Champions Trophy final against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. After the final was replayed after a washout the previous day, Tendulkar had gotten off to seven runs in 22 balls in a 223-run chase before rain struck again and both teams were declared joint-winners of the 2002 CT edition.
Rahul Dravid’s 300th ODI
Leading India in the 2006 Champions Trophy, Dravid played his 300th ODI against Australia at the PCA Stadium in Mohali in a must-win match. Dravid registered a half-century as India put on 249 batting first. However, the Aussies would record a comfortable six-wicket win before proceeding to win the title.
Sourav Ganguly’s 300th ODI
On the comeback trail, Ganguly set up a win for India in his 300th ODI appearance with a half-century against England at Headingley in 2007. After securing a 116-run opening stand with Tendulkar, Ganguly helped India set a 325-run target that they would defend in a rain-affected game. Dada also chipped in with two crucial wickets in his seven-over spell during the 38-run victory.
Yuvraj Singh’s 300th ODI
Another man on the comeback journey, Yuvraj Singh played his 300th ODI against Bangladesh in the 2017 Champions Trophy semifinal in Birmingham. Yuvraj would have a quiet outing as he was not required with a bat in a nine-wicket win set up by Rohit Sharma’s century and Virat Kohli’s unbeaten 96.
MS Dhoni’s 300th ODI
India’s most successful skipper and wicket-keeper Dhoni played his 300th ODI against Sri Lanka in Colombo in August 2017. Dhoni chipped in with a brisk 49 not out in 42 balls as India piled on a mammoth 375/7 with Rohit and Kohli smashing centuries. Dhoni effected three catches later on as India rounded up a 168-run win.

Content:
The 90th season of the Ranji Trophy will close on March 2, 2025 as Vidarbha secured their third title over Kerala at their home ground at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha, Nagpur on Sunday. India’s premier red-ball tournament was established in the 1934-35 season and initially called as the Cricket Championship of India before being renamed the year after.
Bombay were the inaugural champions of the red-ball championship and has since established a staggering record with 42 title wins, the latest of them coming last year when they beat Vidarbha in the final at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Karnataka (formerly Mysore) are the second most successful team in the Ranji Trophy with eight titles.
Vidarbha made their maiden appearance in the Ranji Trophy final in the 2017-18. The Faiz Fazal-led side beat Delhi and proceeded to defend the title over Saurashtra the following season. Since 2001, only Mumbai (twice),  Rajasthan, Karnataka and Vidarbha have won the title in successive years.

Virat Kohli is set to appear in his 300th ODI match during the India vs New Zealand Champions Trophy 2025 league stage clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Sunday. The 36-year-old Kohli will join an illustrious club of cricket legends to reach the 300-match milestone in ODIs and the first player in six years to cross the landmark.
Kohli’s former IPL teammate and West Indies powerhouse Chris Gayle was the last player to feature in 300 ODIs, achieving the mark in August 2019 against India. Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin was the first player ever to reach the milestone of 300 ODI matches. Azharuddin played his 300th ODI against Australia in October 1998 and also became the first player to cross 9000 runs in the format.
Since Azharuddin, 20 other cricketers have featured in at least 300 ODI matches with India batting legend Sachin Tendulkar eventually topping the charts with 463 matches to his credit.
Kohli will be the seventh Indian cricketer to appear in 300 ODIs, joining Azharuddin, Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh in the elite club.
Kohli, however, will make a unique distinction with his 300th ODI match, illustrating his longevity across all formats of the game with the milestone. Kohli will become the first player to appear in 300 ODIs while also having played at least 100 Tests and 100 T20Is.
Kohli made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2008 and has since gone onto dominate the 50-over circuit with a whopping 51 centuries. Kohli surpassed Tendulkar’s tally of 49 tons with his 50th century coming up against New Zealand in the 2023 ODI World Cup semi-final in Mumbai. Kohli’s jaw-dropping average in the format stands at 58.20 with 14,083 runs. Only Tendulkar (18,426) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) have aggregated more runs in ODIs.

While both teams have qualified for the next round of the tournament the winner of tomorrow’s contest will play Australia and the loser will play South Africa.

India and New Zealand were the best sides in the group by distance.

IND vs NZ pitch report
The Dubai pitch has not been as batter-friendly as some of the Pakistan pitches. Especially once the ball has gotten older and softer batting has become difficult against the tweakers and seamers who could execute the slower balls skillfully. Hence teams batting first would have to maintain the right balance between attack and defence and construct the innings accordingly which both Bangladesh and Pakistan have failed when they played in Dubai and batted first.
IND vs NZ weather report
The temperature is expected to be around 25 degrees centigrade for Sunday according to the Accuweather App. In the first game when India played Bangladesh, the surface did slow down quite considerably in the second innings however, it was not the same when India faced Pakistan as the pitch got quicker in the evening hence it will be quite tricky for the captain to win the toss to decide what to do as there has been not much of dew either in both games.

India will take on their ICC tournament bogey team New Zealand when the two teams face off in Dubai on Sunday. With both teams into the semifinal, this match will be to see which side finishes on top of Group A. If India finish second, they’ll face South Africa who is the topper of Group B and if India finish first, they get Australia. Quite an unenviable position for the Men in Blue.
With rumblings in the Indian team about skipper Rohit Sharma’s fitness, India might opt to rest the skipper. But on Saturday, Rohit was seen batting in the nets which might indicate that he’ll be playing. Still, India might opt to make a few changes in the Playing XI to keep all the players on their toes.
CLICK HERE TO CATCH ALL THE LIVESTREAMING DETAILS
The young Punjab pacer Arshdeep hasn’t had a sniff of Champions Trophy action with India preferring to go with the veteran Shami and Harshit Rana in their pace department. With the pressure somewhat off in Sunday’s match, India might opt to give Arshdeep a go while resting Shami in order to manage his workload. With Shami rested, Arshdeep and Rana will spearhead the India pace attack along with allrounder Hardik Pandya.
Like Arshdeep in the pace department, India have opted to go with Kuldeep, Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja as their three spinners. So, in the match against New Zealand on Sunday, expect the think tank to give Varun a whirl. The mystery spinner was in hot form in the England series at home so it’ll be interesting to see if he is given a chance to showcase his skills in Dubai.

Title: WPL 2025: Home, no advantange, as RCB lose four straight; Shafali Verma’s 80* powers DC to big win

Smriti Mandhana seemed to consider tossing the coin up with her left hand – something Harmanpreet Kaur does from time to time for India – because her luck hasn’t been good. She fumbled, then tossed it with her right hand anyway. And when it went against her she walked away with a wry smile, as Delhi Capitals skipper Meg Lanning did a little celebratory fist pump, giving Mandhana a pat on the shoulder.
In her long, decorated stint as Australia captain, Lanning was often asked what she would have done if she lost the toss. Her response almost invariably, without hesitation, was a version of: “it doesn’t matter”. But in the Women’s Premier League, it has mattered a whole lot. Only one team so far had won batting first.
That was the case once more on Saturday as Lanning’s DC became the first team to confirm their place in the knockouts with a thumping, back-to-back, 9-wicket win to ensure Royal Challengers Bengaluru finished their home leg with four defeats from four matches. Asked to bat first, RCB managed to put just 147/5 that DC managed to chase down with 27 balls to spare, riding on an unbroken 146-run partnership off just 77 balls between Shafali Verma (80* off 43) and Jess Jonassen (61* off 38).
The advantage of winning the toss aside, the challenge for DC was to start well because they were back in action in less than 24 hours after another convincing 9-wicket win the previous night. And they did just that as Shikha Pandey struck in the second over, having Mandhana caught at slip with a brilliant delivery that angled away. Ellyse Perry continued to be the lone warrior for RCB as she scored yet another half century (60* off 47 balls) but it didn’t help the home side that she barely had the strike in the backend of the innings. Raghvi Bisht, while doing a decent job early on stabilising the batting order, couldn’t shift through the gears fast enough and by the time RCB’s hitters came in, there were too few deliveries remaining to do any damage. DC’s bowlers were solid once more, with debutant Sree Charani impressing with 2/28.
In the run-chase, Lanning couldn’t get going this time, out for 2 off 12 balls thanks to a stunning catch by Perry. The narrative around Shafali’s batting in WPL has been how having Lanning at the other end often helps her but this time around, she took off despite losing her guiding factor early. With the move to promote Jonassen to No 3 clicking for the second time, the left-right combo quickly deflated any hope RCB might have had. Shafali has had a decent season so far without that one big score, so that was another box ticked for DC. The swashbuckling opener showed her array of big strokes once more, a six into the stands over deep midwicket eliciting a “wow” from Jonassen at the non-striker’s end.

In this form, DC look the real favourites once more with all the four other teams searching for consistency, as the league moves to Lucknow. Mandhana ended the night with a sorry to the home fans who had turned up in huge numbers for the second season running. The defending champions now have a mini break to regroup before two huge matches that will decide their fate.

Title: Nostalgia at Sharjah stadium: From a Guinness record to now playing to empty stands
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sharjah-stadium-nostalgia-guinness-record-empty-stands-9863447/
Content:
The hashtag #ItAllStartedHere that adorns the cream coloured walls of the Sharjah Cricket Stadium says it all. From 1984 to 2001 — when the Indian government banned the Men in Blue from playing there – it had been the epicentre of cricket. If World Series Cricket or the tri-series were synonyms with the Australian summer, so were the multi-national tournaments in Sharjah, played under the name Cricketers Benefit Fund Series (CBFS). For Indians, any mention of Sharjah in a conversation doesn’t end without the mention of Javed Miandad’s last-ball six in 1985 or Sachin Tendulkar’s Desert Storm in 1998.
The empty stands, which are now aged and a throwback to a different era, used to drum up such an electric atmosphere that it made Tony Greig scream on air, “They are dancing in the aisles in Sharjah,” when Tendulkar was in full flow in 1998. Decades have gone by but the Sharjah Cricket Stadium still stands intact. With Dubai and Abu Dhabi having modern stadiums it isn’t the most sought after these days, but it still remains the heartbeat of cricket in the middle-east.
The old scoreboard has given way to an electronic one, which seems to be the only upgrade. Those hoardings over the canopies which famously used to give away the next scheduled tri-series in the city are still around. So is the one-storied stand behind the sight-screen on one end, where one of Tendulkar’s sixes off Michael Kasprowicz landed in the final got Greig going, “Ohhhhh this is high, what a six! What a six! Way down the ground, it’s on the roof. It is bouncing on the roof.”
Those were the glory days of Sharjah. Now, the stadium resembles an old din that has clearly seen its best days. Apart from the numerous photographs – which don’t have a contemporary active international cricketer — that adorn the walls, there is nothing to indicate how this venue used to be a stopover for most teams every year. In the case of India and Pakistan, there have also been instances where they have played two series in a calendar year, much to the excitement of the numerous expats who live here.
“Cricket has been going on in Sharjah for over 50 years now,” Mazhar Khan who is the general manager of the Sharjah Cricket Stadium says. “In 1974, we were the first club to invite teams from overseas with a State Bank of India team arriving here in 1975 and PIA in 1976. Then Abdulrahman Bukhatir thought why not invite the international teams of India and Pakistan. They decided to have this benefit purse in Sharjah, which started in the 1980s. And that way, retired players who had represented India and Pakistan, used to get a purse of $50,000. That’s how it started and it continued till 2000,” Mazhar says.
With the tensions boiling over in the stands, the venue has had a habit of segregating the Indian and Pakistan fans separately to avoid any incidents. For a long time it just had concrete seats, but with time they put in those bucket seats which were ravaged by Afghanistan and Pakistan fans when they played a Asia Cup fixture here in 2018. “The security department here, they know that it’s better to separate them. Especially when you play Afghanistan, even India or Pakistan, they always prefer to keep them aside. So, there are no issues amongst them,” Mazhar says.
Since that first ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 1984, it has hosted more than 300 international fixtures (which finds a place in Guinness world records which also includes around 253 ODIs, the most any venue has hosted. In 2001, after the match-fixing saga, the Indian government banned its team from playing in the city, which continues till date. That ban meant, between April 2003 and February 2010, it didn’t host a single international fixture. The drought would only be ended by Afghanistan, which used the venue as its home base during its initial years.
“In those days, it was easier to request the Indian and Pakistan boards to come and play because there was no FTP. But with the amount of cricket these days, it is impossible. So Sharjah had its own time. But even now, we are hosting internationals. Last year, the ICC used the venue for the Women’s T20 World Cup. Before that the IPL happened here,” Mazhar says.
Though India has long stopped visiting the city, with Dubai being its favoured destination for cricket in the middle-east these days, Sharjah has somehow still managed to hold its relevance. Owned privately, the stadium has a self sustainable model in place where the venue is rented for matches and even for entertainment shows.
“We are a privately owned stadium so unless we host matches it is hard to maintain it. So, that’s why we try to keep the stadium busy with not only international games, but also allow entertainment shows and corporate matches to happen. On an average, we play about 225, 30 games in a year, which includes our domestic season,” says Mazhar.

On Thursday one such game was underway with eerie silence for company. Nobody was dancing in the aisles.

Title: Champions Trophy | SA vs ENG: As Jos Buttler moves on, he hopes to take a leaf out of Joe Root’s book
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-sa-vs-eng-jos-buttler-moves-on-joe-root-9863441/
Content:
Sunil Gavaskar’s anecdote about the time Sir Viv Richards sledged him on the field is quite familiar to most cricket fans. But, a quick refresher: The only time in his career that Gavaskar batted at No 4 in a Test – in 1983 against West Indies in Chennai – India lost two wickets in the first over bowled by Malcolm Marshall.
“I managed to avoid the hat-trick and at the end of the over Viv ran past me and said, ‘Hey, no matter, no matter, no matter what number you bat, man, the score is still zero’,” he says, the last part with a Caribbean accent.
England’s decision to move Joe Root to No 4 in ICC Champions Trophy has been somewhat similar. Before the tournament, England took the call to play keeper-bat Jamie Smith at No 3 – where Root had played 63% in his ODI career – to have more dynamism in the top order and to have Root anchor the middle order. But, no matter what, he has come out to bat well inside the first Powerplay. Phil Salt and Smith have both been dismissed at 5.2, 6.1, and 2.3 over-mark across the three matches.
It’s just one of the many things that didn’t work out for England as they went out of the tournament without a win, thrashed by South Africa in Karachi by 7 wickets with 125 balls remaining. Batting first, England – jolted by losing three early wickets including Ben Duckett’s – managed just 179. South Africa entered the quarterfinals with a run-chase that resembled a glorified net session for the most part.
Former England captain Mike Atherton’s first question to outgoing captain Jos Buttler in the post-match interview was point-blank. “Jos, dare I say, was that the kind of performance that reassures you (that) you’ve made the right decision?”, he asked. “Yeah, that was a really disappointing performance, wasn’t it? We’re so far short of the mark,” Buttler replied with a wry smile.
To his credit, Root at No 4 was still England’s best. Against South Africa too, he looked in good rhythm before a wobble-seam ball sneaked through his defence. But around him, there hasn’t been any significant contribution apart from Duckett’s 175 against Australia. As Buttler moves on from leadership, he hopes to take inspiration from Root. “Joe’s been a shining light and a great example for English cricket throughout. Obviously, we can see what he’s done since he relinquished the captaincy and taken his game to new levels, leading in a different way for the team. Hopefully, I can follow his lead, get back to my best form and start contributing to the team in the way I want to.”
England’s white-ball form has fallen off a cliff in recent times, with three straight disappointing ICC events. Brendon McCullum has taken over the head coach across all three formats recently, and his take before the match against South Africa was interesting. “They just are desperate to want to perform and it’s actually stymieing in the ability of us to be able to get the performance we want because they care too much.”
England deserve credit, under Eoin Morgan’s reign especially, for redefining how to play limited-overs cricket but the team has looked a shadow of that, and the defeat against South Africa was symptomatic of that.
Buttler couldn’t quite put his finger on why there has been such a dropoff in form. “As a whole group, we’re not obviously getting the results and that takes away some confidence and stuff. Time for everyone to sort of go away, have a change of scene and work hard wherever cricket takes them next. There’s a huge opportunity for everyone inside and outside the dressing room to really put their hand up and say they want to be part of the rebuild of the white ball teams.”
For South Africa, there were a few concerns despite a convincing win. Illness in the camp meant captain Temba Bavuma and Tony de Zorzi were unavailable. Then stand-in captain Aiden Markram also left the field due to a hamstring issue, but later confirmed it was precautionary. But with two huge wins in their two completed matches, they have ticked a lot of boxes. None more satisfying than seeing Heinrich Klassen return to the side after an elbow concern and appear in supreme form.
The two fours he hit to get to his half-century were things of beauty. Jofra Archer, England’s best bowler on the night, bowled two perfectly good length deliveries in the fourth stump channel. Those are the deliveries that are meant to cause uncertainties to batters. But Klaasen stood tall, with the weight on his backfoot initially then transferring it forward through the punch, and just pushed them through extra cover for back-to-back boundaries. The raise of the bat from Klaasen for his fifty would have been met with relief in the South Africa dressing room.

Marco Jansen’s ability to strike early even on unhelpful conditions was another positive as he picked up three wickets in the first powerplay, with two of those thanks to adjusting his lengths to bowl short with no swing available. He then backed up with a stunning catch in the outfield too to dismiss Harry Brook, running 28m towards deep midwicket to grab a blinder.

Title: A final before real final? India meet their big tournament nemesis New Zealand
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-dubai-ind-vs-nz-rohit-sharma-gautam-gambhir-9863405/
Content:
It has been three days since New Zealand arrived here, yet because of different tournament schedules they haven’t had the opportunity to bump into the Indian players. On Sunday, when they arrive at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium for an afternoon clash of the Champions Trophy, the very sighting of New Zealand would definitely reopen some wounds in the Indian camp.
This might be an inconsequential game – with both teams confirmed of a semi-final spot and even the venue of it – but has the making of being the final before the actual final next weekend. So far in this tournament, it is India and New Zealand that have stood out not just in terms of results, but also the way they have gone about. Man for man, both teams are equally matched, impactful openers at the top, two solid No 3s, accumulators and enforcers in the middle-order, all-rounders to provide balance and firepower to finish innings off, spinners to choke opponents and seamers who just about hit the right length on these decks.
Having made short work of both their matches against Bangladesh and Pakistan, this does feel like the match that will truly reflect whether India are in with a chance of going the distance. For a side that looked listless with their on-field strategy when New Zealand went about handing shockwaves after shockwaves during the whitewash in Tests at home, they have looked a different outfit here. From pre-game preparations to enforcing the same in the middle, they have seldom faltered in terms of execution.
New Zealand, though, will be nothing like any other team they have faced here. While there has been plenty of focus with regards to how India’s middle-order would confront the New Zealand spinners, the same can be said about how Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav would come up against a batting line up that includes Will Young, Devon Conway, Kane Williamson, Tom Latham, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips. As they showed in the Test series win over India, they are a batting outfit that doesn’t just go with a one-dimensional approach to attack the spinners. On similar slow conditions, the Kiwi batsmen had after all out batted Indians.
And they have the same personnel with them here as well. In Young, Conway, Williamson and Latham, they have batsmen to bring controlled aggression. If they are intent on taking the spinners down, in Rachin, Mitchell and Phillips have batsmen who have the firepower to clear the big boundaries with ease.
“With the quality of the Indian spinners it is about how we can rotate strike, how can we take the game deep and be able to give ourselves a chance to launch an attack at the death. And if we do that, first put a competitive score on the board. And obviously, if we’re chasing, that becomes really crucial to limit those dot balls in the middle overs with how good their spinners are,” Phillips said of their plan as a batting group which mirrored that of India’s.
Even on the bowling front, a reason why India have every reason to be wary of New Zealand is they have their bases covered. Armed with four spin-bowling options to go with seamers who are good with bowling cutters as well, they have a rounded-attack to keep India’s batsmen in check.
“It’s playing a little bit slow and there’s obviously a good deal of turns. I think it’s going to be an interesting match-up. They’ve got three quality spinners and I guess for us we obviously have a lot of all-rounders as well as our top bowling line-ups. We do have a lot of bases covered regardless of the situation that we’re going to be facing,” Phillips added.
So on Sunday, India are in many ways up against multiple challenges – to keep the winning momentum going and to ensure they remain fresh for the semifinal, which is bizarrely scheduled for Tuesday with just one rest day in between. It is making India tread cautiously. In both the matches, they have batted second, so ideally before getting to play the semifinals, they would prefer to test how their batsmen go about in terms of setting up a target. If that is their intention on Sunday, then it will also come at the risk of them bowling second, which would give their bowlers not enough time to manage their load ahead of Tuesday’s fixture. If New Zealand win the toss, then the call would be beyond their reach.
In terms of personnel as well, India are caught in a bit of muddle. Their premier pacer Mohammed Shami showed signs of struggles during their match against Pakistan, but with a week’s rest is good to play on Sunday. Given his recent fitness issues, how well they manage his load for two matches in three days is a burning question that is confronting the team management, which is also aware that unless he gets enough game time in the middle, his rhythm will not improve.
The story is the same with Kuldeep Yadav as well. With New Zealand having a good mix of left-handers and right-handers in their top seven and the three spinners India have used in two matches here being all left-armers, there are temptations to include Washington Sundar or Varun Chakaravarthy. But Kuldeep, like Shami, coming from an injury lay-off against Pakistan seemed to get his old mojo back. As Kuldeep mentioned afterwards his accuracy will only improve when he plays more games, so benching him for Sunday in favour of matchups could prove more detrimental. Interesting tussle on and off the field, awaits India.

Title: India’s Dubai base forces Australia and South Africa to travel early to UAE

Content:
South Africa will leave Karachi and travel to Dubai immediately after the Group B match against England concludes on Saturday. Australia  will also be in Dubai by then after having played Afghanistan in Lahore on Friday.
But both teams won’t know until the completion of the India versus New Zealand group match in Dubai on Sunday as to who they will face in the semifinals and where their respective matches will be played — Dubai or Lahore.
Depending on the semifinal line-up one of the teams will head back to Lahore where they will face New Zealand on Wednesday. Semifinals in two different countries is a result of India refusing to play in Pakistan but that has complicated travel plans for Australia and New Zealand.
The first semifinal involving India is scheduled to take place in Dubai on Tuesday, the second in Lahore a day later. The final on Sunday will either be in Dubai or Lahore depending on whether India qualifies or not.
“We wanted to give teams as much time as possible to get acclimatised to the conditions in Dubai. Travelling on Monday would have made their preparations complicated,” sources in the ICC said.
The hybrid model, which sees India play all of their matches in Dubai, has already witnessed criticism from several quarters.

What is also perplexing is why the semifinals are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday with a three-day gap before the final. Having the semifinals on Wednesday and Thursday would have given the teams travelling from Pakistan to Dubai for the semifinals a bit of a respite.

Title: Catch dropped, spinners awry: A forgettable day for Kerala in Ranji Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-2025-kerala-catches-dropped-poor-spinners-vidarbha-9863220/
Content:
Under the enormous stairs behind the dressing room, fans were clicking photographs with Vidarbha’s cricketers after the day’s play. Yash Rathod rubbed his jaws, tired after the selfie spree with his parents and relatives. A few yards away, near the lawns, Harsh Dubey was busily reeling off autographs to a bunch of schoolboys. Squad members frolicked in the corridor of the dressing room. Officials greeted each other with warm smiles and hugs. An irrepressible air of festivity soaked the Jamtha.
One more day remains to wrap up a largely absorbing Ranji Trophy, but Vidarbha have sauntered to a spot of near-infallibility. The hosts have gathered a lead of 286 runs, have six wickets intact, and are in no mood to make the game adventurous by declaring early. “We want to bat as long as possible,” Vidarbha’s batting pillar Karun Nair would say. His side would have no overwhelming aspirations to venture for an outright victory, rather they would travel the safe route of batting Kerala out of the game and prevail by the virtue of the first innings lead.
Twice have slender first-innings lead rescued Kerala in the knockouts. But this game has perhaps sailed, beyond any interventions of fortune, or miracle, or their own will to regather from the brink. Maybe, they knew this as much when they dragged their battered bodies and bruised souls past the boundary lines. They rushed tracelessly to the comfort of their hotels, where they would wish the day to end as early as possible. Or to think that the day didn’t exist at all. Or how a day that began with promise ended in tears.

Belief buzzed when Vidarbha slipped to 7 for 2. MD Nidheesh was purchasing seam movement both ways; Jalaj Saxena was finding natural variation. Their first-innings tormentor Danish Malewar looked edgy; Karun Nair could be vulnerable at the start of the innings. But like receding waves during low tide, hope waned. On a day, they had to put their life on the line, they shrunk to their shells. Malewar survived a close DRS, judged not out on on-field umpire’s call. He overturned an lbw, off Nidheesh, seeking DRS.
In these moments, Kerala felt the day was not destined to be theirs. Both were close verdicts, but they entered sulk mood and let the game drift with confounding tactics and careless fielding. If Sachin Baby’s intemperate slow-sweep haunted Kerala on Friday, Akshay Chandran’s hapless spilling of Karun on 31 would torture them on Saturday. Eden Apple Tom had industriously set up Karun for a poke outside the off-stump. He teased him with full balls swinging away, traded a four in the bargain, pulled his length back a bit and made the ball leap awkwardly at him. The edge meandered playfully into Akshay’s palms. But somehow, the ball bobbled out of his hands. He had gloriously misjudged the pace of the ball. Eden was distraught, the rest wore a resigned look, as though they had not any energy left in them for one final push before the ball got old and lost its sting.
💯 for Karun Nair 👏

The tactics were bizarrely defensive. Kerala’s comeback aspirations relied on picking wickets. But they were more conscious about stopping runs. It played into the accumulation ploys of Karun and Malewar, who rotated the strike with ridiculous ease, without the pressure of close-in fielders. Even when Jalaj bowled over the stumps on a line outside the off-stump, a slipsman was shockingly absent. Only after a few edges whizzed past the cordon was a man deputed at first slip. In contrast, Vidarbha had warmed the Kerala batsmen’s ear with the chorus of the close-in fielders. Apart from a short-leg, mid-off and mid-wicket, most of Kerala’s fielders prowled in the deep, or were in run-saving rather than catching positions.
When impatience grew, the strip became relatively comfortable to bat on, Kerala lost patience and began to shuffle their bowlers without any concerted plan. In his over-exuberance, Nidheesh repeatedly ran into the danger area and was twice warned. NP Basil rumbled from around the stumps and bowled four disciplined overs for six runs, before he was taken out and never thrown the ball again. Eden bowled with the sprightliness of a 19-year-old, but lost his radar after the dropped catch.
The spinners, on whom Kerala had invested their hopes, were wholesome letdowns. Jalaj erred with his lengths, giving Karun and Malewar the time and width to work him effortlessly off the legs. Sarwate barely spun the ball and bowled  guilelessly. The spinners, combined, eked out only two wickets in 57 overs on the same deck Harsh Dubey and Parth Rekhade coaxed turn and bounce. Worse, the Kerala pair hardly looked piercing enough to pick a wicket, forget a flurry of them required to put on a fight. It meant, Kerala let their indefatigability fade on the penultimate day of the season. Unless they plot an OG heist, they would reflect on this day as one of lost opportunities. Vidarbha, contrastingly, is in a festive mood.

Title: Ranji Trophy final: With an unbeaten 132, Karun Nair reminds selectors of his hunger for big runs

Content:
Nudging the hundredth run of his innings, Karun Nair did not forget the figure that mattered more to him. After waving his bat at the audience — a poster scribbled, ‘Karun the Vidarbha Rock’, fluttered in the mild breeze — he raised nine fingers towards the dressing room, stressing that this was his ninth hundred of the season. Five in the Ranji Trophy; four in the Vijay Hazare. Or was it directed towards the selectors sitting in the adjoining box? Conspiracy theorists swung into (mis)interpretation mode.
“It was actually meant for the side-armers. I had told them about getting my ninth hundred,” he explains. A pause and mischief kicks in: “But you could take it whichever way you want,” says Karun, chuckling in the joy of an unbeaten 132 that has effectively sealed the Ranji Trophy for Vidarbha. The hosts have progressed to 249/4, the lead stretched to 286 at stumps on Day Four.
Whoever the intended recipients of his celebrations were, his broad willow has already ferried the message of resurgence in the currency of runs and centuries. In every domestic tournament this season, he has compiled a mountain of runs — 255 runs at 42.50 with a strike rate of 177 in six SMAT outings, 779 at 389.50 in eight Vijay Hazare Trophy knocks and 860 runs at 57.40 in 16 Ranji Trophy excursions.

The latest was arguably the most endearing of them all. For several reasons; because it was etched in the final, the conditions were arduous, the bowlers incisive in bursts, and the last act leaves a lasting impression in memory. Even after the season ends and fresher memories consign the past to oblivion, posterity (maybe even the selectors) would associate the edition with Karun. The season of Karun Nair, it shall be remembered. Like it was the season of Mayank Agarwal six domestic seasons ago.
Whether the body of work facilitates a Test comeback — the dream that fuels him — is uncertain, he wouldn’t repent that he had fought as hard as he could. “I’m not the person to make those decisions,” he says with disturbing modesty.
The final was the crescendo. He was crushed that a run out ended his first innings at 86, he threw his bat in a rare show of emotion. “The hundred was there,” he says, sighing. But in the second coming, he was resolved to reach three figures (his second in a Ranji final, the other a monstrous 328), extend his team’s supremacy and extinguish the flickering embers of Kerala’s fightback. “Few people gets the opportunity to bat in a final, so I look to make the best of it,” he says, almost degrading an average of 135 in Ranji finals.
The 132 not out captured all the virtues that had resuscitated his crashing career. Out of Karnataka, of the national selectors’ mind, his triple hundred against England reduced to an academic trivia, Karun was on the verge of becoming a forgotten man in Indian cricket. “It was easy to give up, but I decided to fight,” he summed up his comeback mantra before the final.
His fight raged on for almost the entire Saturday. The day was only 15 balls old when he strode in, his team reeling at 7/2, the surface prone to wanton mood-swings, and Kerala bowling with fire and energy. His fight is hard to quantify, because he leaves no footprint of it. He did not crumple his shirt; the trousers, crisp and white, left no trace of the red pit he was batting on. Unless you watch him, you wouldn’t realise the battles he waged.
It’s because he carries a sense of peace and control into the middle. He resisted tempters outside the off-stump from Nidheesh, akin to the one that deceived Dhruv Shorey. When once he did, and the ball moved away, his soft hands and the clockwise tilt of the bat face at the last second ensured the edge dropped fast and flew along the ground. His defensive robustness led to Jalaj Saxena’s withdrawal from the attack. Occasionally, he played and missed. But unlike batsmen of inferior temper, he did not brood on those aberrations.
He realised the folly of looking to survive. The lead was still meagre, and he quickly essayed a pair of punchy cover drives to reduce the mounting pressure. “It was difficult, but we were just looking to survive and score as many runs as possible, and to not think too far ahead,” he says.
The shots were not manufactured, but when the bowlers erred, ever so slightly, he latched on. Slowly, he drilled into Kerala bowlers a feeling of impregnability. Akshay Chandran spilled an unputdownable catch at slip, Jalaj grazed the shoulder of his bat with a spitter, but Karun batted as though nothing untoward had happened. That no matter how much the deck or bowlers allied, he would remain unshakeable at the crease, batting as long as a triumph was assured. When Jalaj tried to land the ball on the same area he had the ball spit, he reverse swept, picking the ball almost from his front pad, in line with the off-stump.
His was a masterclass on blunting spinners on a semi-turner. He defended with incredibly low hands, read the flight adeptly, moved late but decisively. He did not sweep or step out for the sake of it, but only when those measures were required. He relied more on clips off his legs, taps through the off-side, and glides behind square-leg as old-fashioned spin virtuosos dealt spin.

He chose moments to counterattack. Without any hints, he jinked down the track and smeared Aditya Sarwate for consecutive sixes either side of the sight-screen. He resumed his grinding ways, as though he became a different person altogether. Even after the hundred, the trophy almost sealed, he batted on, as though he wanted to score every run that could be scored, every run that could take him closer to regaining the lost paradise. The message of resurgence has already been delivered.

Title: Champions Trophy: After England bowled out vs South Africa, all four semifinalists confirmed – but not the matches

Content:
With England dismissed for a paltry 179 after opting to bat first in Karachi on Friday, South Africa’s place in the semifinals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 was officially confirmed. This means that the semifinal lineup at CT 2025 is the same as the World Cup 2023, although the matchups have yet to be decided.
In Group B, Australia’s place in the last four was confirmed on Friday, when their match against Afghanistan was washed out without a result in Lahore. Afghanistan, on 3 points, needed England to beat South Africa by a margin of 200+ runs but England didn’t even score that many.
In Group A, India and New Zealand are confirmed to progress to the semifinals, and their clash on Sunday will determine who tops that pool. Pakistan and Bangladesh finished without a single win as their match was washed out after two defeats each.
Irrespective of who tops Group B (South Africa or Australia) we will not know the semifinal schedule until Sunday night. The schedule is such that India will play their semifinal in Dubai on Tuesday irrespective of where they finish in the group, so their opponents will also have to wait. The second semifinal is on Wednesday in Lahore, and will be the one that doesn’t feature India, who will take on Group B 2nd placed team if they beat New Zealand.
In fact, according to a report in ESPNCricinfo, both Australia and South Africa will travel to Dubai on Saturday itself, and one of those teams will return to Pakistan based on what transpires in India vs New Zealand. The report said, “an ICC official said the decision had been taken to allow the side that plays the semi-final in Dubai on March 4 the maximum time to prepare for that contest.”

Title: Why South Africa stand-in captain Aiden Markram will miss remainder of England Champions Trophy match
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/south-africa-captain-aiden-markram-injured-england-ct-2025-match-9863066/
Content:
South Africa’s stand-in captain Aiden Markram suffered a hamstring injury during their last Champions Trophy 2025 league-stage match against England at the National Stadium in Karachi on Saturday.
Leading the team in the absence of Temba Bavuma, who was ruled out of the game due to illness, Markram went off the field in the 31st over due to the discomfort. “Two guys have had illness around the camp, Tony (de Zorsi) and Temba miss out. Unfortunate that they miss out but hopefully they will recover. *Tristan) Stubbs and Klaasen come into the side. Stubbs has a good technique, he will open the batting. Our last game got rained out, we had a few training sessions, we are ready for this game,” Markram had said at the toss.
The 30-year-old Markram will not come out to bat unless required with the extent of his injury still unknown. The dashing right-hander had slammed an unbeaten 52 as South Africa recorded an 106-run win over Afghanistan in the first match of the tournament in Karachi.
Heinrich Klaasen took over the leadership duties from Markram before South Africa shot out England for 179 in 38.2 overs. England’s meagre total meant that South Africa had secured their berth in the semi-finals alongside Australia from Group B, ahead of Afghanistan. Both Australia and South Africa will reportedly travel to Dubai on Saturday night with uncertainty over their knock-out venue in Lahore or the UAE with India qualifying for the semifinals of the tournament hosted by Pakistan.

Title: ‘Patience is one of the biggest things that Afghanistan players need to learn’: Dale Steyn on how AFG can win an ICC tournament
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/afghanistan-cricket-team-patience-icc-tournaments-dale-steyn-9863022/
Content:
Former South Africa pacer Dale Steyn said that Afghanistan can go on to win a limited-overs ICC tournament in the next decade provided they learn to play in a patient manner. In recent years, Afghanistan have been a force to be reckoned with in ICC tournaments, upsetting the more established team with their recent win against England in the Champions Trophy  a prime example of their skills.
They had almost reached the knockouts in the 2023 ODI World Cup, defeating former champions England, Sri Lanka and Pakistan while they were the semifinalists at last year’s T20 World Cup, where they knocked out Australia.
“We live in a time now where people are not patient enough. We can hardly watch two seconds on an Instagram story and it just feels like the Afghanistan players are similar when they’re playing their cricket,” Steyn said on ESPNCricinfo.
“Patience is one of the biggest things that Afghanistan players need to learn, and once they get that down, honestly, in the next decade, they could win ICC tournaments, for sure. They want things to happen so quickly. This ball must be a wicket, there’s no patience to building up and taking a wicket. The batters are the same sometimes, they’re batting in the first over. There’s so much movement happening in the crease, so they’re trying to hit a six and they’re trying to get the game going,” Steyn noted.

Afghanistan are almost out of the Champions Trophy after their match against Australia was washed out on Friday. Even though they defeated England to stay alive, their heavy loss to South Africa in their first match has come back to haunt them. Now, they are looking towards England to defeat South Africa by at least 200 runs which seems like a distant dream.

Title: Karun Nair hits second Ranji Trophy Final century against Kerala in career-best season
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/karun-nair-hits-second-ranji-trophy-final-century-against-kerala-9862836/
Content:
Vidarbha batter Karun Nair continued his purple patch in the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 final as he backed up his first-innings 86 with his 23rd First-Class century against Kerala at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha, Nagpur on Saturday.
Batting in the second innings on day four of the contest, after Vidarbha earned a 37-run first-innings, lead the previous evening, Nair walked in at number four after Kerala removed the openers within the first 14 deliveries. Building another fortifying partnership with Danish Malewar with whom he shared a match-defining 215-run stand in the previous innings, Nair denied Kerala the chance of a comeback with his stroke-filled hundred off 184 balls.
The century was the second hundred for Nair in a Ranji Trophy final across four appearances since his debut season in the tournament for Karnataka in 2013-14. In the previous innings, Nair also went past 8000 FC runs in his 152nd appearance. The right-handed batter has also tallied 800-plus runs for the first time in a Ranji Trophy season.
The 33-year-old Nair who returned to the spotlight after a whirlwind Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign last month, finishing with 752 runs and five hundreds in seven innings, was also among the runs in the second phase of the Ranji Trophy. Nair smashed a hundred in Vidarbha’s last league game against Hyderabad and backed it up with his 22nd First Class century in the quarterfinal victory over Tamil Nadu.
Nair played the final in his maiden First-Class season in 2013-14 as Karnataka beat Maharashtra to claim the title. In the following season, Nair emerged as the Player of the Match in the summit clash as he cracked a marathon 328 – the highest individual score ever in a Ranji Trophy final – against Tamil Nadu as Karnataka defended their title.
While over 3700 runs of Nair’s career has come for Karnataka, his brief India Test career between 2016-17 also saw him become the second Test triple-centurion of the country behind Virender Sehwag, cracking an unbeaten 303 against England in Chennai.
Karun Nair in Ranji Trophy finals:
2013/14: 44, 20*
2014/15: 328 (best by any batter)
2023/24: 0, 74
2024/25: 86, 100* (batting)

Title: ‘I’ll bat my own f***ing way’: When MS Dhoni lost his cool and stunned Michael Hussey thought his CSK ‘coaching career was done’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/bat-my-own-way-ms-dhoni-angry-losing-cool-hussey-csk-coaching-ipl-9862756/
Content:
Former India and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni’s approach to the game revolves around his icy cool demeanour in the face of mind-crunching pressure on the field. But if one were to encounter the odd moment and fall on the wrong side of Dhoni’s generally unwavering temper, the experience could be stunning and perhaps, eye-opening.
Dhoni’s former teammate and current CSK batting coach, Michael Hussey, recently described an incident with wicketkeeper-batter that left him gobsmacked during his first coaching season in the IPL.
Hussey, who represented CSK from 2008 to 2013 and returned for another year in 2015, joined the franchise as a batting coach in their comeback year following a two-year ban in 2018. Steering the side to the Playoffs, CSK were to meet SunRisers Hyderabad in the Qualifier 1 match where Dhoni’s men would be pitted against Afghan spin wizard Rashid Khan who was making waves in only his second season in the league.
The former Australia batter would almost immediately find out that he couldn’t get too technical with coaching ahead of big games.
“I love it. The talent there is unbelievable and you get to coach, ‘loosely’. It is more like not to try and stuff them (players) up, with some of the greatest players around,” said ‘Mr. Cricket’ as he reflected on his coaching journey in the Backchat Podcast.
“To be able to work with MS Dhoni, for example, the greatest finisher in the history of the game in my mind… I sort of used to pinch myself,” Hussey added before he revealed an iffy exchange.
Hussey said an exchange of data on Rashid Khan’s variations would not go down too well with Dhoni during the Qualifier 1 game later on.

A post shared by BackChat (@backchat__)

“The night before the big game, the analyst sends me through this split screen of Rashid Khan. And it’s basically when he bowls his wrong’uns, he runs in his fingers together and when he bowls his leggy, his fingers are apart. ‘Ooh this is good’. But this is the night before the game though, so I’m sitting on thinking do I send this out to the batters or do I not? I sat looking at it for an hour because you don’t want to put too much stuff guys’ head the night before the game.
“But I’m sitting on this and thought I’ll never forgive myself if I didn’t send this through and I sent it to the batting group. I said for what it’s might worth you might want to use it or just ignore it if you don’t. Faf du Plessis loves that kind of stuff and he came back immediately, saying ‘awesome, yeah, yeah’,” revealed Hussey.
Chasing 140 in the Qualifier 1 against SRH in Mumbai, CSK would crumble to 39 or four as Rashid would castle Dhoni. Though CSK would scrape home to victory by two wickets, Dhoni left Hussey thinking his coaching career was done for good.
“We were like four down for nothing the next day and Dhoni’s in with Faf at the other. Rashid Khan comes in first ball and bowls the wrong’un. Dhoni goes for the cover drive, hitting against the spin, bowled. You got to understand that this guy is a mega star, like bigger than god.
“He comes in and looks me straight in the eye and he goes, ‘I’ll bat my own f***ing way, thanks’ and sits down next to me. Oh, Coaching career, done! I sat for the rest of the game like a stunned mullet,” Hussey recounted with a chuckle.
As CSK would meet SRH again in the final and waltz to their third IPL title, a calmer Dhoni approached Hussey to clear the air.
“Dhoni’s a great guy and he comes up after the game and said, ‘The information was great, but I needed more time and a couple of net sessions to process it'”.
Hussey admits it was a gruelling start to his coaching career, but thankfully Dhoni “stuck with me” as the Aussie’s coaching association with the franchise extends to a seventh edition this year.

ENG vs SA Champions Trophy 2025 National Stadium Pitch Report And Karachi Weather Forecast Updates: England will take on South Africa in the 11th match of the Champions Trophy 2025 at the National Stadium in Karachi on Saturday. The former has been eliminated from the competition after losing the first two games and the latter has one foot in the semi-final.
Going into the game though England’s batting has been in good touch it is the bowling that has looked out-of-sorts. Meanwhile South Africa on the other hand did bat well in their only game against Afghanistan and the pace-attack looked like a well-oiled machine on the night. However, South Africa’s second game against Australia was a washout.
ENG vs SA pitch reports
In the games at Karachi, the pitch had a bit of grass and cracks. The pacers when they bent their back did get quite a bit of help and both bowling attacks South Africa and England have some high-quality seamers up their ranks to make the most of the conditions and whichever attack can execute their deliveries with accuracy will have an upper hand.
ENG vs SA weather report
According to Accuweather, the temperature is around 30 degrees centigrade on Saturday and conditions are pleasant for playing cricket. There will be always a dew factor that has to be considered when playing subcontinental conditions and the team that wins the toss will want to chase and make use of the wet conditions in the evening.
South Africa vs England squads
South Africa:Ryan Rickelton (wk), Tony de Zorzi, Temba Bavuma (c), Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Heinrich Klaasen, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Corbin Bosch.
England: Jos Buttler (c), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Tom Banton, Harry Brook, Rehan Ahmed, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Jamie Smith, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Saqib Mahmood, Phil Salt, Mark Wood.

Title: Matt Short set to miss for Australia’s Champions Trophy semi-final due to injury
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/matt-short-set-to-miss-for-australias-champions-trophy-semi-final-due-to-injury-9862422/
Content:
Australia opener Matt Short is set to miss the Champions Trophy semi-finals after suffering a thigh injury during Friday’s abandoned Group B match against Afghanistan in Lahore. The in-form opener suffered a quad injury in the field and hobbled his way to a brisk 20 off 15 balls.
Skipper Steve Smith said the opener was unlikely to be fit to face India or New Zealand on Tuesday or Wednesday.
“I think he’ll be struggling,” Smith said. “I think we saw tonight he wasn’t moving very well. I think it’s probably going to be too quick between games for him to recover.”
Jake Fraser-McGurk would offer similar skills as a replacement for Short at the top of the batting order, while young spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly is Australia’s travelling reserve.
“We’ve got a few guys there to come in to fill a job,” Smith added.
The 29-year-old Short had impressed in the opening match against England, setting the tone in their record-breaking chase with 63 off 66 balls, before Josh Inglis and Alex Carey carried Australia to victory.
Australia will play their semi either against India in Dubai on Tuesday or against New Zealand on Wednesday in Lahore. They will only get to know their semifinal opponent after the Group A fixture between India and New Zealand on Sunday.
Australia squad: Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Spencer Johnson, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matt Short, Adam Zampa. Travelling reserve: Cooper Connolly

Title: Why Dhoni quit his Railway ticket collector job and Gopi wants respect for sports quota players
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/why-dhoni-quit-his-railway-ticket-collector-job-and-gopi-wants-respect-for-sports-quota-players-9862400/
Content:
Next time you travel by train and spot a fit-looking Ticket Collector (TC) seemingly bored with his job, try remembering the face. The person in the black coat and tie with a reservation chart in hand could be a future sporting star biding his time, tolerating life’s struggles to pursue his grand secret dream.
Try taking a picture, you never know, it could be the next MS Dhoni.
National badminton coach and a formidable voice in Indian sport, P Gopichand put that nondescript railway employee under the spotlight when this last week, he articulated the pain and dilemma of those getting sarkari jobs under the sports quota.
With the disclaimer that no employment is lower or higher, he said sportspeople “struggle to find excitement in anything” beyond the sporting arena. Not the least, working as a TC or the president of a sports body. “TC is very tough and others don’t understand the motivation struggle and having to say ‘Yes sir, yes sir’ to IAS officers even when we talk about sports,” Gopi told The Indian Express.
As India gets serious about sports and a large section of youth takes the leap of faith to consider it as a career option, it’s a debate whose time has come and the story of the world’s most famous TC needs an urgent revisit.
The observant among those passing Bengal’s busy Kharagpur railway station in the early 2000s would recall a reluctant railway employee who went on to be a cricketer with a country-wide cult. He had long hair and was an obvious misfit. That budding wicketkeeper-batsman couldn’t juggle the 8-hour shift of poaching ticketless travellers with cricket for too long. He quit and went on to be arguably India’s greatest-ever captain.
The biopic MS Dhoni: The Untold Story captures the turning point of his life in detail. “Papa, if I start thinking of job security, I would never be able to play cricket,” Dhoni tells his father, who is perplexed by his son’s decision to walk away from a sarkari naukri.
As a budding cricketer with potential and no sponsor, the young Dhoni desperately wanted the Railways job. He was middle-class, and had family responsibilities. The boy from Jharkhand knew that with his father’s pump-operator salary, the family would struggle for funds needed for his sister’s impending marriage. And it was only after he had eased his father’s wedding expenses that Dhoni had a change of heart. Liberated from his family duties, he now thought it was right to be selfish, think about his cricket.
The self-driven cricketer knew that if he aspired to have wings and fly high, he couldn’t afford to hang around trains for most part of his day. He said goodbye to the Railways and the rest is history.
Are there lessons here? Maybe, but questions for sure. Does a government job scuttle the growth of sportspersons? Does fixed pay, healthcare and pension kill the hunger in athletes? Sarkari jobs provide early endorsement of youngsters with talent, stop them from quitting early, but does it also throw them into an ecosystem that isn’t conducive for outliers with audacious aspirations?
Cricketer Diana Edulji, the former India captain and later a senior Railway officer, doesn’t agree. She talks about 330-plus days of paid leave for athletes and gives several examples of top international sportspersons like Mithali Raj, PT Usha, Sanjay Bangar and Murali Karthik having flourishing careers while working for Railways.
But in Dhoni’s case, according to the movie, this wasn’t true. Maybe, it’s because he joined Railways as a rookie and climbed the tough slippery ladder. He was young, he was restless. The clock was ticking, he didn’t want the negativity of his snarky colleagues, who didn’t like the special treatment given to him, to impact his play. There were too many battles to fight, way too many ‘bosses’ to please.
The story goes that once, Dhoni travelled to Delhi for trials for the Indian Railways team. Part of a crowd, he got limited opportunities to show his skills. He was rejected. The coach said that he didn’t have the right technique. Others around there didn’t make the blow softer. “Ticket check kar Kharagpur ja ke, tennis ball khel,” someone taunted.
Years later, in 2009, Dhoni would be leading India in a Test at the Brabourne Stadium. He would score a hundred and the Test win against Sri Lanka would perch India on top of the ICC Test rankings. The same old Railways coach was in the stands. Dhoni would spot him. He would walk to him and, through the fence on the boundary, flash a smile and say: “Sir, ab toh technique thik hai?”.
Dhoni could take rejection but not disrespect. Always. But at playing fields and workplaces of government institutes with sports quota recruits, where official hierarchy is etched in stone, there is a culture of throwing rank. Since the all-powerful signature of an officer can decide the work exemption or leave that athletes need to train, there is rampant sycophancy. At times, this reaches theatrical levels.
You could be a gold medallist, but a missed ‘Good Morning’ or the absence of that subtle bow in greeting the boss could mean a transfer to some remote outpost. With time, athletes would get used to the system. Getting in the good books of your superiors was as important as getting into the record books. They would learn the trick of swallowing sporting pride while nodding their heads and agreeing with everything the sahebs said. Dhoni failed miserably in doing that.
The movie shows that the trigger that pushed Dhoni to quit his job were his two snitching colleagues. They had their reasons. And this is what makes the ‘sports quota’ debate grey. It isn’t black and white. With Dhoni taking his time to get a grip of office work, others had to work extra. It was human for them to complain. There was nothing diabolical about it. A headquarters inquiry into Dhoni’s shoddy attendance would get initiated. That was to be the last straw. Dhoni would give up the job that he was never cut out to do.
An earlier scene clearly suggested that Dhoni wouldn’t be a TC for long. It was about his trial that his friend, a Railway employee, had arranged for him. The friend had suggested Dhoni’s name to Ganguly sir, the man responsible for sports quota hiring, who would bowl at the applicants.
So, the ageing pot-bellied recruiter would get ready to bowl his loopy slow spinners. In front of him was Dhoni, all set to go ballistic. But no one hit Ganguly sir, he had to be indulged. That was the culture. That day Ganguly sir was hit, the balls kept flying out of the ground. The good friend would panic, he would walk towards Dhoni and whisper: “Out ho ja Mahi, nahi toh yeh daalta rahega… naukari ka sawal hai. (Get out Mahi, or he will keep bowling, your job is at stake).” Not really, this was the man who would go on to even take calls on BCCI’s most powerful officials and turn a deaf ear to heavyweight politicians. “Bhaiyya, naukari ke liye out thodi hoyenge. (Brother, why should I get out even if this is about my job!).”
Dhoni was one of a kind, a one-in-a-billion cricketer. He would refuse to get out. But those less ambitious, servile and seeking job security and pension would get out to Ganguly Sir. They wouldn’t change, but the system should.

Temba Bavuma’s South Africa will take on Jos Buttler’s England in the penultimate game of the Champions Trophy league stage. With qualification and a semi-final spot on the line, an in-form Proteas side will hope to iron out the chinks against a shaken and wobbly England unit that has lost both of its previous group-stage games to Australia and Afghanistan. South Africa enter the contest after the one-point cushion they received from the washout against Australia, shortly after thrashing Afghanistan in the opener by 106 runs. With Heinrich Klaasen likely to return, South Africa will have momentum on their side against a depleted English bowling attack.

Title: ENG vs SA: Heinrich Klaasen set to play for South Africa, Mark Wood to miss out for England

South Africa’s wait to get into the semifinals got a little bit longer when Australia vs Afghanistan match was abandoned by the rain on Friday. If Australia had beaten Afghanistan, both them and the Proteas would have qualified on Thursday itself. But due to the washout, the Temba Bavuma-led side will face England in Karachi.
The Proteas already have one foot in the semifinal and even a loss by a small margin to England won’t be enough to eliminate them due to their superior run rate. The only way the South African team can be eliminated is only if England beat them by more than 200 runs which if you look at England’s form this tournament, doesn’t seem a possibility.
South Africa will hope that Heinrich Klaasen, who hasn’t played a single game this tournament due to an injury, will be raring to go after getting cleared to play. The destructive batter is always an asset for any side but with him joining a South African side that is already firing on all cylinders with Ryan Rickelton, Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen and Aiden Markram all in good touch, England might find it pretty hard to keep South Africa quiet. Tony de Zorzi is expected to sit the match out if Klaasen plays.
England who are already eliminated might opt for a single change with bowler Mark Wood sitting out due to injury. He’ll likely be replaced by Saqib Mahmood who had a decent T20I and ODI series against India where he accounted for Rohit Sharma’s scalp in the 1st ODI.
England: Phil Salt, Ben Duckett, Jamie Smith (wk), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (capt), Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood

Title: Women’s Premier League: Meg Lanning’s Delhi Capitals finally put together perfect game
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-bowling-fielding-delhi-capitals-meg-lanning-mumbai-indians-9862035/
Content:
There was a nice embrace between Meg Lanning and Shabnim Ismail at the end of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) match in Bengaluru. When Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals met earlier in the season, in the battle of retired international superstars it was the South African pacer who looked sharper and dismissed the DC captain with a peach. But on Friday, Lanning stamped her class, taking down Ismail with an array of boundaries, including a stunning on-drive, as DC went on to beat MI in a one-sided contest to go top of the table. “I’ve played a lot against her and she’s a great competitor I love coming up against her. So yeah, it was nice to get a couple away today,” Lanning said after the match. It was just one of the many things that went her way.
The ‘win-toss-win-match’ trend continued as MI were asked to bat and never got going, managing just 123/9. The run-chase was then broken open early by Lanning and Shafali Verma – the WPL’s most prolific duo – as DC put together a perfect match to win with 33 balls to spare.
While the chase appeared to be a formality, the game was set up by DC’s bowlers, led once more by veterans Shikha Pandey and Jess Jonassen. While the Indian pacer was impressive in the powerplay to prevent MI from getting off to a flier, Jonassen picked up the two wickets that mattered – that of the red-hot Nat Sciver-Brunt and captain Harmanpreet Kaur. It was also, arguably, the best fielding performance any team has put together in this year’s WPL, headlined by a catch of the tournament contender by Annabel Sutherland, who ran in 28m from long on to pull off a low diving catch to dismiss Amelia Kerr.
Watch the catch here:

“It was an incredible catch You know We speak about as a team wanting to attack every ball that goes in the air and and try and get there. That was the epitome of that so I’m it was certainly crucial for us,” Lanning said. “We wanted to put all three facets together. We’ve had patches where we’ve played well so far but not the whole package. You want to keep improving throughout the tournament and we certainly feel like we’re doing that.”
While there were plenty of good bowling performances on the night, Lanning chose to highlight one in particular in her post-match chat. Over three years of WPL, the former Aussie captain has typically used every possible opportunity to put the spotlight on (even without prompting sometimes) Indian domestic performers. And she gave a glowing review of Minnu Mani’s bowling, as the offspinner impressed with her flight and pace variations during her spell of 3/15. “Special shout out to Minnu, she she’s been bowling extremely well throughout the tournament and picked up a couple of crucial wickets for us as well. She’s got some really incredible skills, she’s able to turn the ball when she wants to and then some good variations as well. It’s been a real improvement from from the whole of our team, but particularly some of our local domestic Indian players which has been great to see.”
While going top of the table is important, DC would have wanted to address their Net Run Rate before the last phase of this tournament, given that only the first-placed team gets a direct entry to the title clash. And they did just that, boosting their NRR from -0.223 to +0.201.

Brief scores: Mumbai Indians-W 123/9 (Harmanpreet Kaur 22; Jess Jonassen 3/25) lost to Delhi Capitals-W 124/1 in 14.3 overs (Meg Lanning 60*, Shafali Verma 43) by 9 wickets

Title: India hope to avoid sluggish strike rates, confronted with New Zealand’s cloying spinners
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-champions-trophy-sluggish-strike-rates-new-zealand-9862004/
Content:
Watching India’s batting group bat in the nets on this trip, one aspect that has stood out is how flexible they have been when it comes to preparing for the slow conditions they are facing in the middle. Across their sessions at the ICC Academy ground, they have been as random as a group can get, in terms of their approach. One moment, they are tonking the pacers and spinners out of the park; next moment they are nudging the ball here and there; then out of nowhere, they would show their imaginative side with reverse-sweeps, paddle sweeps and scoops.
In two matches they may have had a comfortable outing in the middle, but there are tough challenges that lie ahead. They are yet to be tested while batting first, where they would be forced to take a lot more risk than they are used to, in search of a good total to defend. On Sunday, with their place in the semifinals secured, India are set to face New Zealand who irrespective of when the Men in Blue bat are bound to test their batting group with a three-prone spin attack.
If one goes by their career strike-rate against spinners — Virat Kohli 92.22; Shreyas Iyer 102.29; KL Rahul 88.94; Axar Patel 96.73; Hardik Pandya 119.66 – one might wonder what the fuss is all about. But those stats don’t tell a story as a whole. These slow pitches have often been their pitfall. In Sri Lanka for example, where they faced similar conditions to what they have here in Dubai, Kohli’s strike rate dipped to 84.05. Iyer 97.43; Rahul 68.88; Axar 73.14.
Here in Dubai where there is help for bowlers right through the afternoon and evening, there hasn’t been an ideal situation to bat. Except for the openers who have been given the licence to go hard against the new ball, for the rest it has been a scrap where rotating the strike hasn’t been easy as fluency of strokes has been hard to find.
“Once those dot balls start to pile up on a batsman, obviously the pressure builds up and you have to play that big shot. And that gives the opposition and bowlers an opportunity,” KL Rahul said on match-eve. “So that has been the challenge. And we’re trying to find ways to see how we can rotate the strike a lot more. We’re all very happy hitting boundaries and scoring boundaries, but on this wicket that is very difficult. We have to make sure that the dot ball percentage is really less and then the risk that you take, the opportunities that you are going to take is suited for this type of wicket and against a certain bowler,” he added.
It is the biggest lesson India seem to have taken from Sri Lanka, where they repeatedly lost games with the bat in the middle overs chasing three totals between 230-248. With New Zealand having four finger spinners, who are all capable of tying down batsmen with their unerring accuracy, for India to keep the winning momentum going, they have to bat out of their skins in the middle-overs.
Although having four fielders outside the circle these days allows batsmen to be lot braver with their approach in the second powerplay, on these pitches India have had to do things differently. In these conditions, the fifth fielder inside the circle can be their biggest handicap as once they cut down the angles inside, finding the gaps to rotate the strike won’t be easy. With the Kiwis having a strong fielding unit that relentlessly charges at the ball, it makes it all the more challenging to score off against the spinners.
“We have to make sure that the dot ball percentage is really less. See how we can move the fifth fielder around and that gives us the opportunity to rotate the strike. You see what suits you best — someone might like sweep and reverse sweep. Someone might like playing an aggressive shot straight down the ground or someone might like playing off the back foot,” Rahul said.
If India bat first, it could make for a fascinating match-up, as to how they go about their approach with the bat in search of scores that their spinners can defend under lights. The idea seems to be to marry their new-found approach to the old-school style, where they want to keep as many wickets as possible looking for a final flourish. That comes with its own risks for if seamers take pace off the ball, they might be hard to score off in the last 10 overs. For India to keep their winning momentum going, they’d want one of their top four to bat the distance, because with their batting depth they are more than capable of getting to par totals and beyond or to chase a par score.
“The wicket is slow. Going in, any new batter, he finds it very difficult to rotate the strike. So, we were mentally a little bit prepared. And yeah, I think on such wickets, whoever is the set batter, the longer he plays, the better it is for the team. And that’s what gives you that extra 30-40 runs. Because if the wickets keep going, the new batters will find it a bit difficult,” Rahul said.
Though KL Rahul revealed that there are some fitness concerns in the camp, skipper Rohit Sharma who has been struggling with his hamstring batted for an hour in the nets. With just one day break between their match against New Zealand and semifinals, India are keeping their cards as close to the chest as possible.

India are likely to bring in Arshdeep Singh for Sunday’s game particularly after Mohammed Shami struggled with his calf during the match against Pakistan. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said India want to manage the bowlers workload while hinting at changes. “If Shami or all the seamers are going to bowl 10 overs bowling second in the first game (vs NZ) and 36 hours later we are bowling first, that’s quite a lot of workload. So may be they don’t bowl their full quota of overs if that opportunity allows itself. We have had a few days off and had two tough sessions. The priority is to have our best guys available for the second game (semi-final) fully fit. But we also don’t want to rest them for another two days. So to get the balance, we might try to share the bowling a bit,” he said.

Title: Rain denies Afghanistan fairytale, but Australia’s heavyweight status is in no doubt
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-australia-heavyweight-rain-afghanistan-chances-9861957/
Content:
Weather had the final say in Lahore on Friday as Afghanistan’s must-win match against Australia was abandoned, a result that saw the world champions qualify for the semifinals. Afghanistan only have a ridiculously impossible mathematical chance now, their dream of making it to another ICC semifinal all but over. But even without the rain interrupting, Australia seemed well on course to win at the Gadaffi Stadium, flying to 109/1 in 12.5 overs in a chase of 274 before no play was possible. It might be a non-result on paper but Australia have once again reiterated their status as ICC tournament heavyweights despite not being at full strength.
It might not have been a pitch as flat as the ones we have seen at Gadaffi Stadium so far this tournament, with an average of nearly 340 runs scored per innings in the two previous games. After Azmatullah Omarzai’s late fireworks took them to 273, perhaps Afghanistan could have still made a match out of it with a good bowling and fielding performance. But, after stressing pre-match about curtailing mistakes and doing the basics right, Afghanistan were sloppy. And Travis Head, as he tends to when luck is on his side, made them pay, racing to a 40-ball 59 after being dropped on 6.
Rashid Khan spilled a routine catch for Head’s wicket at mid-on, and the southpaw sent one flying over fine leg for a six on the very next ball to rub salt into Fazalhaq Farooqi’s wound. There was a misfield in the same over as well that went for four. In Farooqi’s next over, Head hit three fours and Afghanistan’s body language said a story. There would have been flashbacks to Mumbai in November 2023, when Maxwell was dropped before pulling off a heist with a double century. With a hat-trick of fours against Omarzai, the run-chase was broken in the powerplay as they posted 90/1.
The first powerplay earlier in the day couldn’t have been starker. Australia and Afghanistan haven’t ever played a Test match, and won’t do so anytime soon. But the first few overs of this match in Lahore resembled one. The Australian pacers, under overcast conditions with the floodlights on in the afternoon, hooped the new balls around significantly, and Steve Smith set fields that wouldn’t have been out of place in a red-ball encounter Down Under.
Bowling the first over, Spencer Johnson did his best Mitchell Starc impression. Full, moving back in late, and underneath Rahmanullah Gurbaz’s bat… timber. The dismissal left Gurbaz stunned, as he stood at the crease for a good minute before starting to walk back, still trying to figure out what had just happened.
Afghanistan have been clear with their plan that they will bat first when possible because that’s how they believe they can maximise their chances. The plan looked like it was going to backfire.
After the first six overs Afghanistan had missed more deliveries than they hit (15 to 14). It was a proper early Test, with a capital T. But Sediqullah Atal, after riding his luck, played a brilliant hand at No 3. He got going with an expansive cover drive for four in the sixth as the swing started to subside. Ibrahim Zadran too started to find some rhythm, and Australia’s inability to be consistent with their lines, saw Afghanistan reach 54/1 – a much better start than they managed against England.
But that’s when the mistakes started piling up with the bat too. After weathering that early storm, Zadran cut a rank short ball from Adam Zampa in his first over, straight to Marnus Labuschagne at backward point. Then Glenn Maxwell got rid of Rahmat Shah and just like that, Australia gained control.
Sediq reached a half century with a six off Maxwell over deep midwicket. But with captain Hashmatullah Shahidi struggling for any sort of momentum (striking at under 50), all the attacking onus fell on the 24-year-old leftie. After a couple of sloppy errors (one missed review and a run-out chance), Smith brought back Johnson and took a sharp catch diving forward to end Sediq’s knock on 85.
Mohammed Nabi and Gulbadin Naib’s dismissals could also be best described as unforced errors. Omarzai produced some sumptuous shots: a 103m six down the ground — almost like Virat Kohli’s famous hit against Haris Rauf – and a 102m six over midwicket were standout moments. But 273 never felt enough.
“I think today was a bad day for me as a batsman, I will speak with the coach about where I went wrong because I think that was, strike rate-wise, a slow innings. But I will learn from today,” Shahidi said post-match. “And yeah about, you never know, yes we still have hopes and we are waiting for the next game, hopefully, England win big,” he added with a big smile. Even in a game of glorious uncertainties, however, a 200-run margin defeat for South Africa seems unlikely.

Brief scores: Afghanistan 273 (Atal 85, Omarzai 67, Dwarshuis 3-47, Zampa 2-48, Johnson 2-49) vs Australia 109 for 1 (Head 59*, Omarzai 1-43). Match abandoned due to rain.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Tireless Harsh Dubey gains Vidarbha the advantage despite not underestimating Kerala’s comeback tendencies
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-harsh-dubey-vidarbha-kerala-9861869/
Content:
The groundsmen lingered near the pitch until Jamtha turned eerily dark and before the swarm of bats flew out from their hideouts under the floodlights. The long-toothed brooms whipped up clouds of dust from the weary surface, before the staff flattened the roughs with large, green hammers.
Beyond the boundary ropes, on the linear balcony with wood-panelled walls, Vidarbha’s players were chit-chatting and giggling. The opposite end was empty, the Kerala contingent had left in a hurry, leaving just a trail of empty water bottles, torn sheets of paper and perhaps broken shards of their dreams.
The mood of the two sides could not have been starker when the third day ended. Vidarbha were jubilant and relaxed. They might not be underestimating Kerala’s comeback tendencies, there could be more devious twists, yet the joy born out of Kerala’s flaky collapse, was irresistible for them to hide. Harsh Dubey, who became the highest wicket-taker in a single Ranji season, reveals as much: “We definitely have a massive advantage, a lead of 37 runs, and they have to bat last. But we have seen Kerala fight back this year, and in cricket anything is possible.”
Record Alert! 🚨
6⃣9⃣ & counting…🔥
Vidarbha's Harsh Dubey has broken the record for most wickets in a #RanjiTrophy season 👏

Anything is quite possible. All four results—win for either team, a draw and tie, loom theoretically.  But practically, a draw looks unlikely. The pitch has not yet transformed into an abominable turner. But the degree of turn has progressed by the day, from 1.6 to 4.2 on Day 3. It could increase in the last two days.
A couple of roughs have swelled and had begun to misbehave. Dubey’s delivery to nail Aditya Sarwate—the ball kicking up and brushing the bat handle — seeded doubts in the mind of his colleagues. Later in the day, medium pacer Darshan Nalkande’s short-of-length ball to Sachin Baby shot along the surface. A Parth Rekhade ball took some skin off the surface in the final session. The devils are slowing rearing their heads.
Used to the nature of the strips here, Dubey believes the pitch would start turning more (and wickedly) on Day 4 and 5. “It would still be good to bat, a few balls would turn and bounce, but  if someone bats like Sachin (Baby) until his brain-fade moment, he can get runs. Lekin zaroor ghoomega,” he fires a warning shot with the last sentence of the answer. “Ghoomega” is when the ball not only turns, but grips, bites and snaps off the surface. Batting would be reduced to a lottery.

If so, Kerala’s most plausible comeback route hinges on their condition-reliant spin-duet of Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarwate wreaking havoc and bowling out Vidarbha for a meagre tally. Both were largely ineffective on the first day, but when they sight a turner, wings would sprout on the shoulders in a trice. They could be deadly in the first session, when the overnight moisture facilitates skid and bounce. Batting, though, could be less arduous when the ball becomes softer, even if the pitch wears more. “We would look to bat as long as possible,” Dubey says.
Striving for survival could be counterintuitive, as wickets could fall in a cluster and there would not be adequate runs on the board. Moreover, Vidarbha has set tall targets for teams to chase in the final innings (and defended all). They could do the same here, in the 37-run cushion of the first-innings lead and Kerala’s unenviable task of batting last on this surface.
That would be the toughest test for Kerala. Mumbai did muster 320 runs on the final day, but that was on a black-soil surface. The turn was slow, even if a few balls spat off cracks. There was the instance on a similar surface in 2022-23 when Gujarat had to chase only 74 runs but were ambushed for 54. Revisiting the scorecard could give Kerala shivers, but the identity of Gujarat’s hangman would cheer them. It was Sarwate, albeit at the peak of his wicket-taking prowess.
More damningly, they would have to devise means to slash the climbing graph of Dubey. He was, yet again, Vidarbha’s tireless strike-force. He strung 44 overs (out of 125 in the innings), mesmerised Kerala’s batsmen with loop, drift and drop, hurried them with his spitefully disguised armer and frustrated them with asphyxiating lengths. Just seven boundaries were accrued from his bowling.

In isolation, he also struck the most decisive blow of the day. He dislodged Salman Nizar, Kerala’s batting mainstay, at the stroke of lunch. It was not as heartbreaking a moment for Kerala as the Baby “brain-fade”, but important nonetheless in the context of the game. Dubey realised that Salman was playing for lunch and was leaving most balls. His concentration was wavering. So he made one rip from outside the off-stump, which he padded up and was adjudged lbw. Kerala’s batsmen should keep such intemperances away, if they are to pull off another heist. Now, though, their fate is in the calloused fingers of Saxena and Sarwate.

Title: There will be temptation to try players but I don’t think it will happen in CT: KL Rahul
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kl-rahul-champions-trophy-india-vs-new-zealand-9861845/
Content:
Wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul is not sure if India would tinker with the winning combination in a big tournament like Champions Trophy despite sealing a semifinal spot, but is certain that the team has learnt to do better in the ICC tournaments, of late.
With big wins against Bangladesh and Pakistan, Rohit Sharma’s side has already secured a spot in the
knock-out stage with a game to go against New Zealand on Sunday.
The current scenario is completely different to their T20 World Cup campaign in 2021 in Dubai when they suffered a heavy 10-wicket defeat against Pakistan, then lost to New Zealand and eventually missed out on qualifying for the semifinals.
Asked if the team was in a happy place, considering the comfortable position they were in, Rahul said he had not thought on those lines.
“Those are things that did affect us back then. And it wasn’t a pleasant time for us players to not be in the semifinals (in 2021) or do well in the competitions. I think we’ve learned from that. In the last two or three ICC events, we’ve done really well, we’ve performed really well,” Rahul said during a media interaction.
“We’re not thinking about what happened in the past or the good things or the bad things. Just what was important was to stay in the present. I get the sense within the team that everyone’s quite relaxed and quite balanced.
“And everyone’s only thinking and talking about the game that is in front of us and not about winning in the semifinals. We are just taking it one step at a time.” Pacer Arshdeep Singh, keeper-batter Rishabh Pant, spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar have not yet got a game.
Since India is already in the semifinal, will the team management be tempted to try out benched players? “I’m not in the leadership group to have to make that decision. But I’m sure there will be some temptation. I’ve been in these positions before where there’s an opportunity where you can try out the players who have important games and do get a game. But I don’t know if that will happen in a Championship Trophy.
“We only have one day’s break before the semifinals. And we’ve got a six-day break now. So we probably want all of the players to play the game and get a little bit of time in the middle. And this is my version. I don’t know. It might be very different tomorrow,” Rahul said, without revealing the team’s game plan.
Rahul said a team like New Zealand can never be take lightly. They defeated India in the three-Test series recently and had also beaten them in the 2021 T20 World Cup.
“It’s my first Champions Trophy and what I’ve realised is things happen really quickly. It’s not like the World Cup where even if you don’t start well, there’s an opportunity for you to come back. But in this tournament, it’s just really hard. You need to be really switched on.
“No game is easy or no team can be taken lightly. So, yeah, that’s how we’ve looked at things in New Zealand. They’ve always been a very formidable team and a very competitive team. We’ve played against them a lot of times in ICC events and they’ve ramped up against us. It’s been quite even in the contest.”
Comeback pacer Mohammed Shami’s ability to add late swing makes wicket-keeping a tough task, and Rahul has got a fair taste of that.
Rahul said he couldn’t praise Shami enough for his accuracy, pace and sharpness.
“He gets the ball to wobble behind the stump as well. So that’s been very challenging. He’s very active and that’s something that not many people talk about.
“Everyone talks about how he’s played and how he can get the ball to seam in any condition. And how bright his seam is. But not many people talk about how accurate he is and how sharp he is.
“Actually, he can surprise you with his pace. Just the other day in the nets, he hit me straight in the back. So, yeah, all of these things make him a very good bowler to play against.
“He’s worked really hard, which is the hardest thing to do when you’re injured and away from the game for so long. So I’m really happy to have him back. And he’s very close to his best.”
Asked if he feels the pressure when someone like Pant is breathing down his neck, Rahul said, “There’s always the temptation for the team, captain or the coach to take him. I’m not trying to compete with Rishabh. I’m not trying to play like him. I try and do what I do best and try and stick to my game.” Often the way Rahul paces his innings gets debated but he is not really worried about that aspect.
“I’m quite used to seeing it and hearing it and reading about it. Sometimes I just sit back and see whether the criticism is valid… That’s not something that I try to think about when I go into a game that I need to up my strike rate.

“I try to see what the best thing is for the team and for me to do in that scenario and I try to do that. And not always am I going to be right.”

Title: AFG vs AUS: What happens if the Champions Trophy match between Australia and Afghanistan is washed out?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/afg-vs-aus-champions-trophy-what-happens-in-case-of-washout-9861723/
Content:
The crucial match between Australia and Afghanistan was halted in Lahore due to rain with the 2023 ODI World Cup winners in a great position in their 273-run chase, scoring 109/1 in 12.5 overs. Travis Head was in blistering form, scoring 59 off 40 before the rain interrupted play.
In Group B, Afghanistan, Australia and South Africa are still in the semifinals race while England were knocked out of the tournament on Wednesday when they lost to Afghanistan which led to their captain Jos Buttler tp step down on Friday, one day before their final match of the tournament against the Proteas.
If the rain washes out the match between Australia and Afghanistan, then the Steve Smith-led side will qualify for the semifinals while Afghanistan will have to wait for the England vs South Africa result. Both Afghanistan and South Africa will have three points each then but the Proteas have a much better run rate than Afghanistan. In order for Afghanistan to qualify, they need England to beat South Africa by at least 200 runs. If South Africa wins, the Temba Bavuma-led side are through to the final.
The Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method will not come into effect in this match because there should be a minimum of 20 overs bowled in an innings. However, the match was halted by the rain in the 12.5 overs so the DLS method will not come into play.
Earlier, Sediqullah Atal hit 85 off 95 balls, while Azmatullah Omarzai (67 off 63) played a fine cameo in the middle-order to steer Afghanistan to a competitive 273 all out against Australia.
Electing to bat, Afghanistan lost opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz early before last-match centurion Ibrahim Zadran (22) and Atal steadied the ship with a 69-run stand for the second wicket.
Omarzai then held the fort in the middle overs with a gutsy half-century to give Afghanistan bowlers a score to defend.

For Australia, Ben Dwarshuis (3/47) picked up three wickets, including two in the last over, while Spencer Johnson (2/49) and leg-spinner Adam Zampa (2/48) took two wickets apiece.

Title: Are New Zealand’s spinners capable of slamming brakes on India in the middle overs?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand-spinners-ct-2025-santner-bracewell-phillips-9861732/
Content:
Having brushed aside Bangladesh and Pakistan to confirm their semifinal berth in the Champions Trophy, India have their task cut out on Sunday when they face their nemesis New Zealand. On paper, New Zealand appears a mirror-image of India – a strong batting line-up with a good mix of left-handers and right-handers; a minimum of four all-rounders in the XI; three lethal quicks; and depth in both batting and bowling. In short, New Zealand has all their bases covered.
However, more than fast bowlers Will O’Rourke, Matt Henry and Kyle Jamieson, who all have troubled Indians in the past, there are three key men that could prove to be stumbling blocks for Rohit Sharma & Co.
– Mitchell Santner, a bespectacled left-arm spinner, who hardly gets to bowl at his home venue in Hamilton and at times even walks out as an opener in white-ball fixtures. Famously bowled a clutch spell against India at Manchester to choke them in the 2019 World Cup semi-finals. Now the captain of the side, like his idol Daniel Vettori.
– Michael Bracewell, the latest player from the Bracewell cricketing lineage, he was a late bloomer but has established himself as a mainstay in the side with his batting prowess and off-breaks and is among the leading spinners in this tournament, picking up five wickets at an average of 12.80.
– Glenn Phillips, a wannabe pilot who loves adventure sports, these days he is busy diving across fields grabbing stunning catches and saving runs in the circle. He is also a designated finisher. And in sub-continental conditions, his off-spin is more than handy in the middle overs.
By now, it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that New Zealand were the first team to make the semi-finals. In the flatbeds of Pakistan, where bowlers have had a hard time to keep the scoring rate down, New Zealand have been exceptional with the ball. Their three spinners may not have any mystery element in them and all three happen to be finger-spinners but they have aced the conditions, which have been offering minimum turn.
If Bracewell has gone at 3.20 runs an over, Santner has conceded at 5.50. Phillips has been the most expensive of the lot, going at 6.63, but still good numbers for someone who started off as a wicket-keeper.
With the pitches offering little help, they have fallen back on their experience of bowling in far more challenging conditions back home. In an earlier interaction with the daily, Santner had said how they rely on creating angles with different trajectories, slowing the pace down and mixing it up to keep batsmen guessing. It is what they have done so far. And they will have to do it again when they play the semi-finals at Lahore.
But before all that, with the chances of them coming back to Dubai for the final remaining bright, they have an opportunity to get used to the conditions here. “The wickets here have looked like they’ve taken a bit of a spin. We’ve got our first training today so it’ll be good to try and get used to the wickets as quickly as we can. We’ve obviously enjoyed the pitches in Pakistan and I think we’ve got a pretty well-balanced side to play in any conditions so hopefully we can continue to do that and adjust to what’s in front of us. I think the strength of our side is adjusting to the surface. So hopefully we continue to do that as a side,” Bracewell said.
In Dubai, the spinners have got enough purchase off the pitch, which has offered them good grip and bounce. Only four months ago, in similar conditions in India, they gave Rohit Sharma’s team a hiding in a Test series. Bracewell, of course, missed the tour with injury, but with his classic, old-school off-breaks, he would test Indian batsmen who regularly struggle against tweakers in these types of slow pitches.
And it won’t just be the middle-overs where the Kiwi spinners will be hoping to leave a mark. With India having a habit of making the most out of batting powerplay, Santner – arguably the best new-ball spinner around — could fancy having a go straightaway, particularly with Rachin Ravindra also around as a left-arm spin option in the middle-overs to go with Bracewell and Phillips.“We’ve got a lot of experience in our spin bowling group with Santner leading the way there and he’s a great person to talk to around. We work really closely as a spin bowling unit with GP (Phillips) there as well and of course Rach (Ravindra) to find out what’s actually challenging on that surface and perhaps set fields accordingly as well,” Bracewell said.
Amid all the noise from  opposition camps over India getting to play all their matches in Dubai, New Zealand have remained unfazed about it. Including their semi-finals at Lahore on Wednesday, they would be playing each of their matches in four different venues. “Oh look, it is what it is. It has been decided and that’s the way that it is and there’s no point dwelling on that. It is part of what makes it exciting,” Bracewell said.
With a rounded attack they have horses for all types of courses.

Title: Jos Buttler resigns as England ODI, T20I captain after Champions Trophy 2025 exit
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/jos-buttler-resign-england-odi-t20-captain-champions-trophy-2025-exit-9861683/
Content:
Jos Buttler on Friday stepped down as England’s white-ball captain following his team’s Champions Trophy 2025 group-stage exit. Buttler announced his decision on the eve of the team’s final league stage match against South Africa, confirming that the match at the National Stadium in Karachi on Saturday will be his last as the leader of the white-ball setups.
After suffering a defeat to Australia in their group-stage opener last week, Buttler’s men suffered a harrowing defeat to Afghanistan in Lahore. England came up eight runs short as Afghanistan put on an inspired performance to pile on 325 runs on the back of opener Ibrahim Zadran’s 177 and held their nerves to see off the 2019 World Cup winners. The loss marked England’s seventh successive loss under Buttler’s captaincy starting from last month’s tour to India where they were blanked 3-0 in the ODIs and lost the preceding T20I leg 4-1.

While Buttler’s rise to the full-time white-ball captaincy after Eoin Morgan’s retirement was met with immediate success with the T20 World Cup 2022 triumph in Australia, the Champions Trophy is the third ICC tournament in as many years where England have failed to reach the finals. The team managed only three wins in the 2023 ODI World Cup and lost to India in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean last year.
“It’s the right decision for me, it’s the right decision for the team, and hopefully somebody else can come in and work closely alongside Baz to take the team back to where it needs to be,” Buttler said in a press conference on Friday.
“It was quite clear that this tournament was going to be important results-wise for my captaincy,” he added.
“With Brendon (McCullum) coming in (as white-ball coach) only recently, I was really excited to work closely alongside him and hope for a very quick turnaround and take the team forward, but it’s not worked out that way. It feels like it’s the right time for me and also for the team to have a change,” Buttler remarked.
Leading in 43 ODIs, Buttler managed 18 wins besides 25 defeats. Buttler led the T20I side in 51, second only to Morgan (72), registering 26 wins and 22 losses.

Title: Ranji Trophy final: Will Kerala pay the price for Sachin Baby’s ill-timed slog sweep?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-sachin-baby-ill-timed-slog-kerala-vidarbha-9861645/
Content:
For an eternity, Sachin Baby stood frozen on his bent knee. His batting ally Jalaj Saxena let out a shriek in anger so loud that it could have been heard as far as the Wardha Road. But Sachin was too shocked to even scream or shout or curse himself, or to move from his crouched follow-through. He had just played the stroke that could define his career, self-destroying a knock that could have defined his life.
Two runs away from his hundred, 56 runs away from snatching lead in the Ranji final, half his batting colleagues dismissed, he fatally slog-swept Parth Rekhade to deep mid-wicket. It was his lone moment of indiscretion in an innings that lasted 235 balls, where he was the wall of resistance and the fountain of hope that kept Kerala in the game and dragged them to the promised land.
It was the exact second the game took a decisive shift towards Kerala. Psychologically battered, they were shot out for 342 runs, the visitors losing the last four wickets for 18 runs, and handing Vidarbha a lead of 37 valuable runs.
A huge moment in the match❗️
Sachin Baby falls 2 short of his 100. A brilliant knock ends.
Parth Rekhade gets the crucial wicket!

— BCCI Domestic (@BCCIdomestic) February 28, 2025
The rare rash stroke undid his day-long vigil. On a deck that was assuming darker and ominous hues of red, he had seen off the penetrative bowling of Harsh Dubey, and was the steadying hand despite the regular parting of his partners. He seemed immune to the pressure of captaincy and the inexorable expectations vested on him by millions in a state starved of sporting glory.
The stroke was antithetical to the tone of his innings. Maybe, the sight of the hundred seduced him. He was overly focused that he didn’t want the hundred to distract his grand ambition to drag Kerala as far as he could past the Vidarbha total. Maybe, a deluge of thoughts suffocated him. Lead, second new ball, pressure, Dubey, his 100th first class match, an approaching landmark, and his mind lost the absolute clarity that it had exhibited until the moment of chaos. Pressure stoops the toughest of men to folly.
Or perhaps, it was just a simple error in judgement, a case of him not imparting the impetus he wanted on the ball. The ball was there, full, tossed up, pleading to be smashed into the fields of black earth beyond the stadium. He tried to hit the ball a trifle too hard and didn’t find the required timing as it looped in the air to the safe palms of his friend Karun Nair.
It’s the context that paints sportsmen as heroes and tragic heroes. His exit brought Vidarbha back into the game, restoring their hopes of finally grabbing the match by the scruff of its neck. But the reason Kerala was in this juncture was Sachin’s untiring vigil.
For 345 minutes, he batted as though this was his life’s purpose, as though he picked the bat for the first time to live and breathe this moment. To play a match-winning role in his State’s first-ever final in his 100th first-class game. He told this paper before the final: “Whether we win this game or not, it depends on a lot of factors, but we want to play to the outer limits of capabilities.”
Sachin embodied the approach, not because he was the captain but because no one was as desperate as him. “I am 36, I don’t know how long I will be able to play the game, don’t know whether I will ever play in the final. So I don’t want to regret that I didn’t give more than my best for the team. Time is running out.” he had said.
He hardly played a false shot, rarely edged (a rare inside-edge onto his pads helped him survive an lbw on DRS), scarcely played and missed (barring a paddle sweep and an uncharacteristic waft off the second new ball). His unfussy batting brought peace to the audience and frustrated Vidarbha’s toiling bowlers. His game-plan was impossibly simple. He left the balls that were meant to be left. The judgement outside the off-stump was immaculate. He drove — he started the morning with a crisp cover drive off Darshan Nalkande — when the ball was driveable. A short man of small strides, he did not reach out for the ball, but intervened, if at all it needed intervention, at the last second. There was no stroke in angst or impatience. He spent overs without scoring, but his patience remained undiminished.
The spinners were expertly dealt with neat, precise movements. As much as he could, he defended or punched them on the back-foot, pushing them to bowl fuller, whereupon he would drive them through covers, his front foot fully stretched to meet the ball. Bowlers tempted him, with full balls outside off-stump. He resisted. They went short and wide, leaving vast expanses unprotected on the leg-side. He swayed away, apart from a couple of instances wherein he pulled with utter authority. Dubey and Co. dug deep into their manual of deception, but he didn’t wither.

And then to squander it all with a hideous stroke like this, Sachin must have felt that the world is a cruel place. His side, though, should be thankful that he was the reason they are still in the game, even though clutching at the straws. All his batting colleagues perished to misjudgement — Jalaj to a half-baked paddle, Salman Nizar padding up to Dubey, Mohammed Azharudheen missed a flick, Aditya Sarwate sequestered into the shell. But it would be Sachin’s slog of indiscretion that could define the game.

Title: Champions Trophy: Australia captain Steve Smith urges umpire to withdraw run-out appeal after Josh Inglis-Noor Ahmad incident
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-australia-steve-smith-umpire-withdraw-appeal-inglis-noor-run-out-9861571/
Content:
Australia captain Steve Smith made a sportive gesture on the field during his team’s high-stakes Champions Trophy group B clash against Afghanistan at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday.
With Afghanistan forging a late lower-order comeback to move up towards a respectable total after opting to bat first, wicket-keeper Josh Inglis had the opportunity to appeal for the ninth wicket at the end of the 47th over bowled by seamer Nathan Ellis. With half-centurion Azmatullah Omarzai slapping a slower delivery to the mid-wicket fielder to retain a single, his partner Noor Ahmad was quick to leave the crease at the striker’s end in the assumption that the over had to come to a close.
FOLLOW: AUS vs AFG LIVE SCORE
However, wicket-keeper Inglis had already gathered the ball and flicked the bails as Ahmad began to drift out from the batting crease for a change of ends after the over. While Inglis and Australia could have appealed for a re-look from the umpires for a potential run-out incident, Australia skipper Smith immediately intervened to waive off the appeal from his team’s side.
The incident, however, quickly drew parallels to the 2023 Ashes incident where Australia Test wicket-keeper Alex Carey’s nimble glovework and presence of mind had England batter Jonny Bairstow involved in a bizarre stumping incident. Chasing 371 in the second Test at Lord’s, England had entered stumps on day 4 at 114 for four.
Batting on the final day, Bairstow was the sixth wicket to fall when Carey’s timely action proved to be decisive for Australia in an eventual 43-run win. Bairstow was stumped by wicket-keeper Alex Carey as he walked out from the crease after a short delivery from Cameron Green.
The dismissal also sparked widespread criticism from English fans. A Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) member was handed a life ban and two MCC members were suspended in the aftermath of clashes with the Australian side.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘We’re excited to try and learn and play in different conditions’: Michael Bracewell on if India have advantage by playing all matches in Dubai

Content:
New Zealand spinner Michael Bracewell sidestepped questions on if India have the advantage in the Champions Trophy by playing in the same stadium while other teams have to travel to and fro, saying that the Kiwis are excited to play in different conditions. Some cricketers, including South African top-order batter Rassie van der Dussen and former Australia skipper Pat Cummins, have said India are in an advantageous position as they have played all their games at one venue while other teams have had to travel to different venues in Pakistan.
“Look, it is what it is. It’s been decided, and that’s the way it is, and there’s no point dwelling on that,” said Bracewell, when asked if India have unfair advantage in Dubai.
“It’s part of what makes it exciting. I personally think it’s coming to a different ground and trying to figure out those different conditions. Yeah, not much more to say on that other than we’re excited to try and learn and play in different conditions,” he added.
India who have played all their matches in Dubai will take on New Zealand in the final Group A game on Saturday, with the Kiwis travelling to UAE after playing both their previous matches in Pakistan.

“The wickets here have looked like they’ve taken a bit of a spin. So, it’ll be good to try and get used to the wickets as quickly as we can. We’ve obviously enjoyed the pitches in Pakistan. And I think we’ve got a pretty well-balanced side to play in any condition. So hopefully, we can continue to do that and adjust to what’s in front of us. I think that’s been the strength of our side, adjusting to the surface. So, hopefully, we continue to do that as a side,” Bracewell said.

DC-W vs MI-W WPL 2025 : Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals will meet once again in a top of the table clash in Bengaluru on Friday with the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side eager to exact revenge on DC for their controversial loss when the two sides had met earlier in the season in Vadodara.
Since that loss, Mumbai are on a tear, winning all their three matches against Gujarat Giants, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and UP Warriorz. With Nat-Sciver Brunt and Harmanpreet Kaur in form, Delhi might find it hard to stop the MI juggernaut. Hayley Matthews’s return to form against UP Warriorz will also add to Mumbai’s momentum and confidence.
DC will also be happy with the fact that batters Shafali Verma and Jess Jonassen’s return to form with the bat after they were inconsistent in the last few matches. But their main worry will be skipper Meg Lanning’s form with the Australian having just one solitary good knock this season. Also, Jemimah Rodrigues and Annabel Sutherland have been pretty inconsistent with the bat.

Title: Vidarbha’s Harsh Dubey breaks Ranji Trophy record for most wickets in a season with 69th scalp
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/vidarbha-harsh-dubey-ranji-trophy-record-most-wickets-season-9860951/
Content:
Vidarbha left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey broke the record for the most Ranji Trophy wickets in a single season during the 2024-25 Ranji final against Kerala at the VCA Stadium, Jamtha in Nagpur on Friday.
Bowling in the second innings after Vidarbha posted 379 on the board, Dubey reached the milestone with his third wicket of the innings, dismissing Nidheesh MD after Tea on Day three. Earlier in the day, the young left-arm spinner removed top-scorer Aditya Sarvate on 79 before trapping Salman Nizar, Kerala’s highest run-scorer of the season, leg-before on the stroke of lunch.
Dubey surpassed the previous-best of Bihar’s Ashutosh Aman who snapped up 68 wickets in the Ranji Trophy 2018-19 season. While Aman’s wickets came entirely in the Plate group that season, Dubey’s wickets have come in more challenging turfs of the Elite Group where Vidarbha have been unbeaten this season.
Dubey set up the semi-final win over Mumbai with his seventh five-wicket haul of the season, the joint-most in a season among Elite group bowlers. The 22-year-old who made his First Class debut in 2022 is one of only six bowlers to go past the 60-wicket mark in a season, behind Aman (68), Jaydev Unadkat (67), Bishan Singh Bedi (64), Kanwaljit Singh (62) and Dodda Ganesh (62).
Besides the truckload of wickets, the southpaw Dubey has also racked up 472 runs in 17 innings this season with five half-centuries. Dubey is only the fourth player in Ranji Trophy history to claim the all-rounder’s double of 450-plus runs and 50-plus wickets in a season.
Dubey recently told The Indian Express he chanced upon cricket by accident as a fourth-grader in school. “We took a wrong turn one day when my father and I were going to buy my fourth-standard school books. I came across cricket practice at an academy there and asked my father what it was. He explained that’s where cricketers were made, and I got hooked and said I wanted to play too,” Dubey told The Indian Express.
After fruitful stints in the off-season, revelling on slow turners and flat tracks has been easier for the youngster, playing the TNCA first-division league in scorching Chennai. Interactions with the legendary off-spinner R Ashwin during his time and coursing different types of pitches in the Tamil Nadu league have helped him expand his versatility. Despite his 23 wickets last season – comprising eight with a five-for in the Ranji final – Dubey was overlooked for the season-opening Duleep Trophy in September 2024.
69* wickets – 19 innings – Harsh Dubey (Vidarbha, 2024/25)
68 wickets – 14 innings	– Ashutosh Aman	(Bihar, 2018/19)

Title: Champions Trophy: Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain say Jos Buttler must step down after England’s group stage exit
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-michael-atherton-nasser-hussain-say-jos-buttler-must-step-down-after-englands-group-stage-exit-9861269/
Content:
England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler was left questioning whether he is “part of the problem or the solution” after leading his side to a second group stage exit in four ICC tournaments at the Champions Trophy.
Former England skippers Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain believe it is the former.
“I think his time is done, actually, as captain and I think that’s probably right,” Atherton was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.
“England have had three bad (ICC events) in a row now, the disastrous 50-over World Cup in India, a poor T20 World Cup in the Caribbean – where they made the semis but they didn’t beat anybody of note though it – and now here, and their cricket is way below the standards which they set themselves.. Sometimes you just have to say it’s not working.”
Buttler’s side failed to defend 351 in their tournament opener against Australia in Lahore, and then lost by eight runs in the final over in a gripping game against Afghanistan at the same venue on Wednesday, bringing their tournament to an end.
Hussain believes that as affable and popular as Buttler may be, there is plenty of proof for the ineffectiveness of his captaincy which is why England must now look elsewhere.
“If you’re having to consider all options, that probably tells me the option is to let it go,” he said. “I thoroughly like Jos Buttler as a human being… but it’s not his job to be popular, his job is to make England better at white ball cricket.”
“If he’s saying there’s a lot of talent in the dressing room, and their win percentage has fallen off a cliff, and they’ve gone out in the group stages of the 50-over World Cup and Champions Trophy, and they’ve lost their last four bi-lateral series, and his form has diminished, I don’t think it [the captaincy] sits comfortably on his shoulders,” Hussain added.

Title: ‘No doubt’ that Indian cricket has left Pakistan far behind’: Sarfraz Nawaz on host’s Champions Trophy debacle
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/no-doubt-that-indian-cricket-has-left-pakistan-far-behind-sarfraz-nawaz-on-hosts-champions-trophy-debacle-9861240/
Content:
Former fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz feels that the once-formidable Pakistan cricket team has failed to keep pace with their Indian counterparts, and places the blame squarely on the administrators in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Rain washed out Pakistan’s final group stage match against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Thursday, leaving the hosts winless in the first ICC tournament held in the country since 1996. The no-result match followed a comprehensive defeat to India in Dubai and a loss to New Zealand in the tournament opener.
Nawaz believes his former side’s poor performance is due to a range of reasons — starting with the team selection that failed to incorporate the spinners that have performed well in recent Test series at home — and that the root of the problem lies in the corridors of power in Pakistani cricket.
“The team (for the Champions Trophy) was unbalanced. Some players were selected because of backing from higher authorities. When the team was announced, I wrote to the chairman of the PCB suggesting spinners like Sajid Khan and Noman Ali, who had wrecked England earlier. They performed well against the West Indies too, but they were not picked at all,” he said in an interview with Cricbuzz.
The former fast bowler, who has 177 Test wickets in 55 matches for Pakistan in a career that lasted 15 years, was not too optimistic about the future either.
“There’s no doubt (that India have left Pakistan far behind)… Pakistan cricket is gone now. I think it’s because of all the PCB officials running the board. They are non-cricketers; they are bureaucrats. That’s why I think they don’t know how to go about things like that. They’ve picked people who previously destroyed Pakistan cricket.
“And then there are frequent changes in the PCB. Within a year and a half, there were three chairmen and four captains. What else do you expect?” he added.

ENG vs SA Champions Trophy 2025 Match Schedule, Live Streaming, Date, Head to Head, Playing XI Prediction, Pitch Report, Weather: A determined South Africa will take on a deflated England in the last Group B game of the Champions Trophy on Saturday. Following a stupendous mauling of Afghanistan in their tournament opener in Karachi, South Africa earned one point from their washout against Australia, holding them afloat in the quest for the knockouts.
A win will propel Temba Bavuma’s side to the semi-finals, joining the winner of the Australia-Afghanistan contest in the last four. The team will also be buoyed by the potential return of the hard-hitting Heinrich Klaasen who will bolster the middle-order firepower. Meanwhile, with harrowing defeats to Australia and Afghanistan knocking them out of the competition, England will have plenty of questions to answer in the batting and bowling departments, irrespective of the dead-rubber nature for them in this tie.
With Jos Buttler’s future as captain on the line, England’s star white-ball batter will hope to make a significant contribution with the blade before heading back to home to contemplate further on the leadership role.
SA vs ENG, Champions Trophy 2025 all you need to know
The SA vs ENG match will happen on Saturday at 2.30 pm with the toss at 2 pm (IST). The match will be played at the National Stadium in Karachi. The match will be broadcast on TV on Star Sports and Sports 18 channels. You can also livestream the SA vs ENG match on JioHotstar.

The weather forecast for Karachi indicates a clear, sunny day with neglible chances of rain. The temperature is expected to be in the 20s throughout the game.
The Karachi Stadium has favoured high-scoring totals for the teams batting first in both games. In their previous match here, South Africa racked up 315/6 against Afghanistan before securing a 106-run win.

Title: Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott: ‘Every game we go into, I expect us to win’

From losing by 275 runs after allowing them to score 417/6 in a 2015 World Cup game 10 years ago, to having the potential to evict Australia out of the Champions Trophy, Afghanistan has come a long way.
This makes Australia-Afghanistan a big-ticket clash, eagerly anticipated despite the rain threat.
Afghanistan’s South African British coach Jonathan Trott said the many-time ICC champions were in no position to take the Afghans lightly.
“It’s all on the line,” Trott told media this week. “Since I’ve been coach we’ve played against Australia three times and we’ve been in the game each of those games, so we should take a lot of confidence from that.
“I think certainly what happened in the T20 World Cup, and I say this to the players as well, that Afghanistan’s never going to be taken lightly ever again.
“So we’ve got to be prepared because I know Australia aren’t going to take us lightly,” Trott asserted ahead of the game.
Last year, Afghanistan knocked Mitchell Marsh’s side out of the T20 World Cup after a historic 21-run triumph in Kingstown, the Asian nation’s first victory over Australia in any format. However the spectre of Glenn Maxwell who “single-leggedly” batted them off the 2023 World Cup, with just a mean golf swing on the bat despite cramps, hangs on Afghan heads in the 50 overs format.
Though captain Hashmatullah Shahidi said their team planned for all opponents, superstar Rahisd Khan had confessed Maxwell’s Wankhede heist gave him ‘nightmares.’ Trott though, is confident after their last two ICC ODI games finished with progression of Australia winning by 7 wickets with 91 balls to spare to them escaping by 3 wickets with 19 balls to spare.
No rain permitting on Friday, Afghanistan have an opportunity to eliminate Australia from an ICC event for the second time in eight months.
He reckoned perceptions had changed and the conditions in Pakistan make them a serious threat. “Whereas in the past, perhaps people would have seen the fixture and thought it was a little bit easier than playing a historic Test nation. But in this format, in these conditions, I don’t see that. I see every game that we play is going to be competitive and every game we go into I expect to win.”

Title: R Ashwin questions England’s ‘mindset,’ asks them to take sub-continental tours seriously
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/r-ashwin-questions-englands-mindset-asks-them-to-take-sub-continental-tours-seriously-9861043/
Content:
R Ashwin questioned England cricket’s “mindset” and slammed their approach towards “sub-continental tours” after the Jos Buttler-led team was eliminated from the group stage of the Champions Trophy.
“I saw Jos Buttler’s post-match interview (after the Afghanistan game). He was very candid in saying, ‘I do not know what my leadership aspirations are in the future.’ They had a terrible 50-over World Cup in 2023. And now they are out of the 2025 Champions Trophy. 1 They don’t qualify for the World Test Championship (WTC) final. So, with all that in mind, I think England are at a crossroads,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“There was a statement from Ben Duckett after losing the first ODI in India. He said, ‘We don’t care if we lose 3-0 to India. Because we want to beat India in the final of the Champions Trophy.’
“It reflects their mindset. Is it so easy to go to a major competition and win the final?”
Ashwin raised questions over England’s batting approach.
“There is no consistent template in your batting. You were marketing and branding Harry Brook as the next generation sensation. But Harry Brook’s game is also sinking. He is now under immense pressure to produce match-winning knocks,” he said.
“What’s happened with England in this Bazball generation is something that they have to retrospect.
“Ravi Shastri has given an amazing comment: that England needs to take sub-continental tours very seriously,” he said.
“The World Cups England won in 2019 (ODI) at home and in 2022 (T20I) in Australia—they actually haven’t come to the sub-continent and won anything of repute.
“Teams like Australia travel very well. They prepare well. They perform well. South Africa also prepares. They put in good performances.
“But England, I still feel, treats sub-continental tours just as a tick box. Has the time come for England to really dig in and think about it?”
Ashwin also said the England coaching staff is not good enough to help them win in the sub-continent.
“In earlier times, we used to get foreign coaches. We used to get coaches from abroad. Let’s say Gary Kirsten, Duncan Fletcher, Greg Chappell. But England, they haven’t gone out of the Western approach.
“If they want to win in the sub-continent, I don’t think their backroom staff has enough experience to win there.
“All these things put into perspective, for sub-continental tours, it is very important to prepare. I always keep thinking about England’s team. Because England’s team has so much ability. Think about their team lineup and ability. Look at the talent they possess, be it ball striking, delivering the ball. Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, everyone is fast.”
Ashwin lamented England’s execution against Afghanistan opener Ibrahim Zadran, who scored 177 runs.
“They are dependent so much on analytics. The company that does the analytics for them is England’s home-grown company. They rely so much on analytical data, but when it comes to execution, they always falter.
“I don’t understand how it happens.
“Everyone knows Ibrahim Zadran is an off-side player. But my question is, you have not targeted his legs or his hips. Ibrahim Zadran made 170 runs, and most of the runs came on the off-side. He hit just one six on the leg-side, that too in front of long-on. He is a closed-off player. He hits without using his feet. And how can there be such a mistake in execution?
“It means there is a mistake in planning. So, obviously, I think when a team is low on confidence, these mistakes keep happening.
“As a cricket fan, I’d love for England to play a better brand of cricket.
“If not for Joe Root’s brilliance, they would have lost by a distance.
“You don’t have the technique to compete in Test cricket. What you are doing in Test cricket is hard to understand. You are not qualifying for the WTC finals either. You need to respect all the formats and make a game plan accordingly.
“According to me, England needs to re-look their approach and thought process when visiting sub-continental nations, whether it is Sri Lanka, India, or Pakistan. A total revamp, in my view, is required in their approach. I really hope England goes from strength to strength.”

Title: R Ashwin: Rule of having 5 fielders in circle and 2 new balls was implemented to nullify India’s spin domination in middle overs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/r-ashwin-rule-of-having-5-fielders-in-circle-and-2-new-balls-was-to-nullify-indias-spin-domination-in-middle-overs-9860946/
Content:
R Ashwin has made a strong plea to do away with the second new ball and the extra fielder inside the circle to restore the balance between bat and ball in ODI cricket and ICC must give it a thought about this particular format of the game. Ashwin also questioned the relevance of the ODI cricket and how the matches in the ongoing Champions Trophy is so monotonous.
“Before this Afghanistan versus England match I was wondering whether there is any future for ODI cricket,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel “Ash Ki Baat.”
“Let’s be very honest with it. In T20Is, there is so much crowd, and consumption is high because it ends inside four hours. I feel Test cricket will excel more once the first-class structure of teams like Afghanistan will improve.
“But in ODI there is no contest. Until 2013-14, ODI cricket was played with one ball. Before 2015, the new rule was implemented where five fielders were allowed in the circle and two balls were introduced. I think in many ways that rule was to nullify India’s spin domination. That is just my take.”
Ashwin, who has spoken on the subject before, said that having two new balls eliminated reverse swing from the game, and said the rule was brought in to nullify India’s spin domination in the middle overs.
“I think that is impacting the game massively. Because reverse swing is gone from the game now. Role of finger spin was also reduced.
“The 50 over World Cup (2027) in South Africa is going to be a real challenge for the ICC. It is at the brink of a decision being made. Because the game is going so slow. It’s meandering along. I have a question in my mind that is there a place for 50 overs in today’s cricket?
“Until this Afghanistan vs England game. This champions trophy was just so monotonous,” he said.
Ashwin also bats for playing ODI with the red-ball.
“There used to be a time where one-day used to be play with the red ball. It is time to seriously give it a thought about this particular format of the game,” he said.

Title: Mitchell Starc eyes IPL comeback, reveals reason behind his Champions Trophy withdrawal
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mitchell-starc-eyes-ipl-comeback-reveals-reason-behind-his-champions-trophy-withdrawal-9860692/
Content:
Mitchell Starc said “sore ankle” was the main reason behind his withdrawal from the ongoing Champions Trophy.
“There are a few different reasons, some personal views,” Starc said on the Willow Talk podcast.
“I had a bit of ankle pain through the Test series, so I just need to get that one right. Obviously, we have the Test final coming up and a West Indies tour after that.
“There is some IPL cricket as well.
“But the main one at the top of my mind is the Test final. Get my body right, play some cricket in the next couple of months and then ready to go for the Test final.”
Starc will make a comeback in the Indian Premier League (IPL), where he will play for Delhi Capitals. Australia have a busy calendar ahead, with the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord’s in June before a three-Test tour of the Caribbean.
Australia are also expecting to have Pat Cummins (ankle), Josh Hazlewood (calf) and Mitchell Starc back available for their World Test Championship defence against the Proteas on June 11.
“I remember (when it was introduced) thinking it doesn’t mean much,” Starc said.
“But we got close to it and missed out and watching it on TV we wanted to be part of it.
“Now we find ourselves sitting with a chance to win it for the second time on the trot.
“I think the format needs some tinkering still … it’s an imperfect system, but two really good teams will be facing off in the final.”

Title: Champions Trophy | No travel gives India an edge, onus would be on them to use that advantage, says Rassie van der Dussen
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-no-travel-gives-india-an-edge-rassie-van-der-dussen-9860585/
Content:
South Africa batter Rassie van der Dussen has admitted that India has the advantage of playing all its matches in Dubai, but at the same time, it will be under immense pressure to do well in the ongoing Champions Trophy. India is playing all its Champions Trophy matches at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
“You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that the ability to train and play in one place, coupled with the absence of any inter-city or inter-country travel, gives India an edge that they will be under pressure to fully exploit,” Rassie van der Dussen told ESPNCricinfo.
“I don’t think you have to be a rocket scientist to know that. The onus would be on them to use that advantage.
“In a sense, it puts more pressure on them because whoever is going to play them in the semi or potentially the final is going to go there and the conditions are going to be foreign but they [India] are going to be used to it.
“The pressure would be on them to get it right because they have all that knowledge.”
Recently former England captains Nasser Hussain, Michael Atherton, and Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed has suggested that India had the upper hand from the outset.
“See, they are in Dubai for a reason,” Aaqib said.
“If they are playing in Dubai for a reason, definitely if you play on the same pitch or ground, you will have an advantage. But we are not losing because they had the advantage of the same hotel and pitch (laughs). It’s not just because of the pitch, and neither did they play some ten matches there.”
Michael Atherton in conversation with Naseer Hussain on Sky Sports Podcast had said: “What about the advantage India have in playing in Dubai, only in Dubai? Which seems to me to be a hard-to-quantify advantage, but an undeniable advantage.”
Nasser Hussain said: “It is an advantage. So, the best team in the tournament have that advantage. And I saw a tweet the other day saying ‘Pakistan host nation, India home advantage.’ It sums it up really,” he said.
“They are at one place, one hotel, they don’t have to travel. They have one dressing room. They know the pitch, they have picked for that pitch.”

Pitch report
The Gaddafi Stadium in two games in the competition has provided surfaces which are conducive for batting. In the first game at the venue, Australia chased down a mammoth 351 which England put on and in the second game when Afghanistan met England over 600 runs were scored overall. The pitch will play similarly on Friday with batters enjoying the conditions.
Weather report
According to the Accuweather app, there is a possibility of rain in the morning however, in the afternoon it would be mostly cloudy and cool. The temperature is to stay around 20 degrees centigrade throughout the day.

Title: AUS vs AFG: Does Australia need two left-armers? Spin to win for Afghanistan

Content:
The clash between Australia and Afghanistan will decide who will go to the next stage of the tournament. It is a do-or-die for Afghanistan however, from Australian perspective even if they lose the contest they will be on three points and would be hoping for England to do them a favour in the final game of this group against South Africa.
Coming into the game Afghanistan have momentum on their side after the thrilling win they had against England. Australia too had a stunning win in their opening clash against the same opponent however, their last game against South Africa was a wash out at Rawalpindi.
Two left-armers?
Both Spencer Johnson and Ben Dwarshuis are left-armers in the Australian attack. While the latter did pick up a couple of early wickets did seem like he lost a bit of gas in the final over of the innings. Australia does have an experinced Sean Abbott warming the bench who not only is a decent bowler but also provides batting depth coming at number eight.
Spin to win
Regardless of the dew factor Afghanistan continued to play with three spinning options in their clash against England and it did bear them fruits. While Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed have looked a bit off-colour in this tournament so far regardless Afghanistan would be hoping the duo would get into form in the final group game and help the side qualify for the semi-final.
Head and Smith
Though the Australian batting line up did come through against England when they face Afghanistan they would need their experinced players at the top to start well to negotiate the Afghan spinners. Though Jos Inglis with his ton in Sri Lanka has showed he has the game to deal with the tweaekrs but the Afghan spinners are different challenge altogether and will need a different skill-set.
Australia predicted XI: Matthew Short, Travis Head, Steven Smith (c), Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson
Afghanistan predicted XI: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: How Afghanistan’s cricket resurgence took root in Sharjah
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-afghanistan-cricket-resurgence-took-root-sharjah-9860258/
Content:
If there is one city, after Kabul and Kandahar, that is closely following the fortunes of the Afghanistan cricket team, it’s Sharjah. In the early 2000s, it became the home of countless Afghans who left a country ravaged by war.
Abdulrahman Bukhatir, the man who brought cricket to the emirates with the best players in the world making regular pit stops in the desert in the 1980s and 90s, opened the doors of his Sharjah Cricket Stadium for the Afghan team in 2010. He and others associated with the game in the city will follow the events in Lahore on Friday as Afganistan face world champions Australia with a spot in the semifinals of the ICC Champions Trophy on the line.
“When they moved here, they faced hardships, but because of cricket, they had a lot of their own people supporting them,” Mazhar Khan, who has been closely associated with Bukhatir for over four decades and is now the general manager of the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, tells The Indian Express.
“In the beginning, they would work in industries in and around Sharjah and train in the evenings. But now they are beginning to dominate the cricket system here with their local players. All the local clubs prefer Afghans.”
Though they had Greater Noida as their home base for a while, since the pandemic they have moved to Sharjah. Many of their key players – like veteran spinner Mohammed Nabi, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Azmatullah Omarzai, Karim Janat – call the city their home.
“They are very comfortable with the environment and feel like home because of the large number of Pathans who live here,” Mazhar says.
They are at home with the pitch and conditions here as well. “We’ve left two pitches reserved for Afghanistan.” The small ground and pitches are tailor made for their spinners. When Afghanistan hosted South Africa and Bangladesh, Mazhar says, skipper Rashid Khan requested, “Sir, don’t want any grass”.
Niaz-Ul-Aslam, the head coach of Sharjah Cricket Academy and one who worked with the Afghan team as assistant coach till recently, sheds light on the preparation for the Champions Trophy.
“It started after the 2023 World Cup. Since this is where they live, when they are here as a team, it helps with their preparation. They are no more a team dependent on one or two men. They have several impact players who can change a game,” Niaz says.
It is not just the top stars from Afghanistan who call the city their home. Of the 300 players enrolled at Sharjah’s Cricket Academy, almost 75 percent are Afghans. The Ramadan tournament, played in a T20 format, starts around the UAE on Friday, and there is a scramble among teams to get hold of Afghan players.
“We have about 20 teams in our tournament. Quite a few Afghans play for various teams and some of them get paid $100 per match, sometimes two per night,” Mazhar says.
Played in coloured clothing under lights on turf pitches, these matches were once dominated by Indian and Pakistani expatriates. But these days, it is the Afghans who are in demand. The number of Afghans is increasing with the second generation beginning to get their education here, and the cricketing ecosystem of the UAE and Oman is also beginning to open its doors for them.
“Earlier, some of them used to move out for education, but now with a lot of schools and colleges here, they prefer to stay as it also allows them to stay connected to cricket. A majority of them are second- generation Afghans settled here, so they are eligible to play.”
Niaz, who is of Pakistani origin, is stunned by what he sees at his academy and during his trips to Kabul.
“A majority of the boys in the academy are from Afghanistan. But what strikes me the most is what is happening in Kabul which the rest of the world doesn’t know. One day I took a count. There were 50 boys who were bowling like Rashid and 37 like Mujeeb-ur-Rehman. They are going to keep coming because they know cricket can change their lives. They are getting opportunities everywhere,” says Niaz.

Last year, fast bowler Omid Rahman, who was raised in Sharjah, became the first Afghan to play for the UAE. According to Niaz, even his brother is knocking on the door. “There are a lot of players waiting for opportunities. You have six teams playing First-Class cricket in Afghanistan, so there is all-round development. It isn’t just about spinners. Look how far their batting has evolved.”
Afghanistan and Australia have some recent history between them. Glenn Maxwell defeated them on one leg at the 2023 World Cup, but the tables were turned at the T20 World Cup last year.
“When you play with their egos, it hurts them. When you want them to win a game, don’t give them any batting or bowling advice. Just find a way to hurt their egos. England and Australia, by refusing to play Afghanistan, have hurt them. They have cancelled matches, which means a lot to the Afghan public. You could see it against England. Now, they want to do the same with Australia,” Niaz adds.

Title: WPL: Why the loss to Gujarat Giants will worry Royal Challengers Bengaluru
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-loss-gujarat-giants-worry-royal-challengers-bengaluru-9860207/
Content:
With 8 runs needed off 24 balls for Gujarat Giants to complete a comfortable win, the crowd at M Chinnaswamy Stadium could still be heard chanting “RCB, RCB, RCB!” The decibel levels, of course, quickly went down as Phoebe Litchfield smashed a six over square leg and GG soon completed a comfortable six-wicket win with 21 balls to spare. RCB’s 125/7 was never going to be enough and with this result, they have lost three straight matches at their home ground.
It is now well registered that RCB receive the widest support in the WPL, right from the first time they hosted matches last season to even the three matches so far. There was a video circulating on social media when RCB hosted Mumbai Indians, with the visiting captain Harmanpreet Kaur trying to drown out the noise by placing her fingers inside the ears. On the flip side, the home side haven’t been able to convert their home advantage into wins.
Firstly, losing three tosses hasn’t helped. It has been firmly established in both legs of the WPL this season that chasing is definitely more advantageous (only one match so far has been won by a team batting first).
After losing the toss again on Friday, Mandhana was asked about losing both the previous games at home and she pointed out how both were close affairs. Indeed, MI won with a ball to spare while UP Warriorz prevailed after the first ever WPL Super Over – a match where RCB plucked defeat from the jaws of victory after posting 180 while batting first.
The match on Friday was, worryingly for Mandhana and RCB, one-sided. “This is really going to hurt us because in all three departments, we didn’t do well,” said Mandhana bluntly in the post-match interview. She refused to put either one of the three disciplines under pressure, but losing their big three batters within the powerplay was a recipe for disaster. Mandhana pointed to her own innings of 10 off 20 balls, where she was repeatedly beaten when trying too hard to hit through the powerplay. When she was out caught in the deep off the excellent Tanuja Kanwer, RCB were reduced to 25/3 and they never recovered.
The defeat also dragged RCB’s Net Run Rate down from +0.619 to +0.155 while GG improved from -0.974 to -0.450. RCB, GG and UPW are all locked in now on 4 points from 5 matches. RCB still have a slight edge due to the close nature of their defeats. They have one match to go in Bengaluru though, and another defeat in front of home fans will likely leave the defending champions in a spot of bother.
Brief Scores: RCB 125/7 (Kanika Ahuja 33, Tanuja Kanwer 2/16) lost to GG 126/4 in 16.3 overs (Ash Gardner 58, Renuka Singh 2/24) by 6 wickets

Title: Box office clash of Champions Trophy: well-rounded Afghanistan vs clinical Australia
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-well-rounded-afghanistan-vs-clinical-australia-9860176/
Content:
Even before the adrenaline could subside after a heart-stopping, rollercoaster ride against England on Wednesday night in Lahore, Afghanistan’s thoughts started to turn toward Australia. Player of the match Ibrahim Zadran, after his record-breaking 177, said it will be important to avoid simple mistakes when they take on Steve Smith’s men. Sure, knocking out England from the ICC Champions Trophy is a big result for the tournament debutants, but it signified their rise in international cricket that they aren’t just here for these one-off wins. The Afghanistan cricket story, inspiring as it is, is not a surprise anymore. On Friday, they will stand with a chance to add another chapter.
World Champions Australia know all too well how difficult it is to face Afghanistan. Rewind back to Mumbai on 7 November at the Wankhede Stadium. Both teams had a chance to reach the semifinals, and Afghanistan had Australia on the mat. Had Mujeeb Ur Rahman not put down a sitter against Glenn Maxwell, the remainder of the World Cup would have looked a whole lot different. Mujeeb dropped the catch, Maxwell dropped an all-timer with a stunning double century. Afghan hearts were broken while Australia went on to be crowned winners 12 days later in Ahmedabad. Of course, captain Hashmatullah Shahidi was reminded about that Maxwell heist in the press conference, and the Afghanistan captain smiled.
“You think we will come only to play with Maxwell? Do you think it will be like that?,” he asked. “We will plan for all Australian batters. I know that he played really well in 2023 World Cup, but that’s part of history. After that, we beat them in T20 World Cup, and we think about all opposition team, we are not coming to the ground to plan on individual player. We are not playing only Maxwell – we are playing Australia.”
Historically, Afghanistan have relied on the consistency of their spinners led by Rashid Khan and flashes of brilliance with the bat to win them matches. But there is a more rounded feel to this side led by Shahidi. In Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran, they have openers capable of playing match-changing knocks. In Azmatullah Omarzai, the reigning ICC ODI Men’s Cricketer of the Year, they have a world-class allrounder in the making. His bowling technique which came for praise from Sachin Tendulkar during the World Cup, has evolved into a potent weapon, with hit-the-deck short balls a crucial part of his arsenal apart from the ability to move the new ball either way as the Indian great had noted. In Mohammad Nabi, they have a wily (old) customer capable of providing the big hits in the lower order and getting through his overs of spin with minimum fuss and maximum clarity. Then there are the likes of Gulbadin Naib and Fazalhaq Farooqi, reliable operators capable of putting their hands up when called upon.
The key men, of course, will still be their main spinners, Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad. Against South Africa in Karachi, they didn’t find much assistance from the surface and went for runs. Rashid went wicketless, Noor struggled with his line more than length and was expensive. Against England in Lahore, where there was a little more assistance, Nabi, Rashid and Noor were in the game a bit more. It was still the pacers doing the damage in terms of wickets, but the spin trio could apply some dot ball pressure at critical times.
With the Gadaffi Stadium being the venue once again, the pressure will firmly on the bowlers from both sides. Australia’s bowling unit, severely depleted in terms of star power, conceded 351 before it was chased down. Afghanistan conceded 317 in their defence of 325. But there is forecast of rain in Lahore on Friday, especially during the daytime. Australia’s game-time (with their match against South Africa in Rawalpindi rained out without toss) and training schedule has been curtailed because of the bad weather, but a washout in this virtual quarterfinal will be enough for Australia to qualify. Afghanistan will need Qudrat ka Nizam on their side as they must win a completed match to progress.
Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott made it clear he doesn’t see this as a match of unequals anymore, no David vs Goliath narrative here. After all, Afghanistan have pushed Australia to their limits in the last three ICC meetings, even defeating them at the 2024 T20 WC. “I say this to the players as well… that Afghanistan’s never going to be taken lightly ever again,” Trott said. “We’ve got to be prepared because I know Australia aren’t going to take us lightly. Whereas in the past, perhaps people would have seen the fixture and thought it was a little bit easier than playing a historic Test Nation. But in this format, in these conditions, I don’t see that. I see every game that we play is going to be competitive and every game we go into I expect to win.”

Title: Ranji Trophy: Vidarbha, Kerala punch and counter-punch as final set on a knife’s edge
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-vidarbha-kerala-punch-and-counter-punch-as-final-set-on-a-knifes-edge-9859970/
Content:
When dusk crawled into the Jamtha Stadium, and stumps called to end a dramatic and exhausting day, the outfield resembled the waiting hall of a medical college. Players slumped to different parts of the outfield, stretching their tired sinews and resting their drained minds, processing the events of a slow-burning, but see-sawing, day.
It was a day neither team would feel inordinately happy or absurdly dejected about, which explains the state of the match – on a knife’s edge, awaiting the next big pendulum swing.
Vidarbha are still the ascendant side. A first-session collapse saw them restricted to 379, when a 450-plus target loomed at stumps on Day One. But the total still daunts Kerala, who have lost three wickets for 131 runs. The red-soil strip could soon flash its venomous fangs, and the visitors have to bat last.
But it could have been worse and better for both. The evening of rumination, thus, would be bittersweet.
As the sun began to retreat, the sky splashed in a palette of colours, Kerala would have noticed just the rosier tints of the skies. Splendid was their comeback, and if they had escaped without more damage, the day would have been theirs. But Ahammed Imran perished, cheering up Vidarbha. It was in tune with the day, both teams making comebacks and neither getting too far in front.
Until he got out, Imran, just 18, and Aditya Sarwate, twice his age, had formed an unlikely union. Both were thrust into a firestorm. Sarwate, though a two-time centurion, had barely batted up the order in his career. Imran was batting for just the third time in his First-Class career. Their openers, Akshay Chandran and Rohan Kunnumal, were already back in the dugout, after inside-edging and under-edging Darshan Nalkande onto the stumps, providing the perfect start for the hosts.
But from a fragile 14 for 2, the duo fire-fought, demonstrating that beneath their scrape to the final is a coat of steel, that they loathe to surrender without a stoic fight. They did fight, yoking defiant defence and calculated counter-attacking. Sarwate threw the counter-blows, driving nonchalantly through covers, often on the rise and with a wristy flourish. When the bowlers pulled back their length, it didn’t stem the flow of runs as Sarwate cut and slashed with aplomb.
After surviving a dropped catch, Imran trenched in. His feet moved decisively, the decision-making found clarity, as he showed the possibility of a long-term solution for Kerala’s top-order dysfunction. He did more than clinging around, tapped and nudged singles, danced down the track to dishevel the length of left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey, swept the brisker left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade, and struck the intermittent boundary. Later, he swivel-pulled Yash Thakur. Short in build and quick of feet, Imran got into comfortable positions to pull. However, he couldn’t contain the burst of adrenaline as he fell to the shot off a heavy ball from Thakur.
The dismissal was indicative of the swing in fortunes on an engrossing day. There was no whiff of drama in the first hour of the morning as Danish Malewar and nightwatchman Yash Thakur lashed boundaries and steered Vidarbha close to the 300-run mark without any damage. At times, the Kerala bowlers tried too hard to coax a wicket. The visitors may have feared Vidarbha batting them out of the game. But they fought back with the rugged tenacity they had exhibited throughout the season.
Three balls into the 10th over of the day, NP Basil’s in-ducker stayed a tad low and snuck through the crouched defensive bailout of Malewar. A more front-foot savvy batsmen would have defanged the danger, but Malewar’s back-foot dominant methods has produced a rich yield in his debut season.
The stroke of luck lifted Kerala’s hopes. The fielders regained their voice and spunk, and bowlers steamed in with energy and intensity. Vidarbha’s batsmen suddenly found themselves in the middle of a tidal momentum swing. In the space of seven runs, they surrendered two more wickets. Kerala’s unrelenting workhorse, Basil LBW-ed Thakur, the nightwatchman, before Eden Apple Tom ejected Yash Rathod with an away-swinging pearl. When Eden removed Akshay Wadkar, in what could have been the final over of the session, Vidarbha were tottering at 335 for 9.
But another twist winked by in the extended 30 minutes of the session, when Vidarbha’s No.11 (but judge him not by the number) Nachiket Bhute freewheeled to an entertaining 32 off 38 balls, laced with two clean swipes over the fence off Jalaj Saxena. Panic chimed in, nerves flayed — Kerala conceded overthrows, set bizarre defensive fields and let Vidarbha’s total soar beyond 350, past 360, finally stopping at 379, 11 minutes into the second session. It would not be the last twist the day saw though. And of the game either.
Brief scores: Vidarbha 379 (Danish Malewar 153, Karun Nair 86; MD Nidheesh 3/61, Eden Apple Tom 3/102) vs Kerala 131/3 (Aditya Sarvate 66 batting)

Title: Sunil Gavaskar reveals how Imran Khan played a crucial role in his historic achievement of reaching 10,000 Test runs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-reveals-imran-khan-crucial-role-historic-achievement-9859949/
Content:
Sunil Gavaskar created history in Ahmedabad in March 1987 when he became the first cricketer of all time to score 10,000 runs. He achieved the feat during the fourth Test of the series against Pakistan. On Wednesday, he revealed that the seeds for that historic landmark were actually sown by Pakistan’s captain that day – Imran Khan – a year earlier.
Gavaskar recalled having lunch with Imran Khan in England when India were touring for a three-match Test series in 1986 (that Kapil Dev and Co won 2-0).
“I got the opportunity to do so (score 10,000 Test runs) only because of one Imran Khan,” Gavaskar said on Ten Sports’ Dressing Room show. “Now, a year before in England, after the first Test was won, Imran and I went with a friend for lunch in London bang opposite the Harolds in London, there is an Italian restaurant. We went for a lunch there. At this point, I told him, this is going to be my last tour (India tour of England 1986). I am going to quit after this.”
Turns out Imran, aware that Pakistan were going to visit India soon, convinced Gavaskar to rethink this decision.
“He said ‘No, no you cannot do this.’ I said, What do you mean no,  it is my choice.’ He said ‘Pakistan is coming to India, and I want to beat India with you playing’.” Imran then said he was aware of a meeting of the governing bodies and a confirmation was imminent. “I said if that announcement is there, I will carry on. But if it doesn’t come, I will finish after the next Test. Sure enough, the announcement came through and I carried on. If I retired at that time, I would have had finished with 9200-9300 runs. Because of that announcement, there were two other series in India, so I got close to 10,000. If Imran had not told me to carry on…,” the former India captain added.
Indeed Gavaskar’s glorious Test career came to a close after that series. In his last Test, played against Pakistan in Bengaluru from 13 March, Gavaskar scored 21 and 96 to finish with 10,122 runs in his career, with an average of 51.22, 34 centuries (also a record at that time). Even in his last innings, Gavaskar was defiant. According to ESPNCricinfo’s report, “Gavaskar gave a masterly exhibition of technique and judgement. Only when he was out, having batted 5 hours 23 minutes and faced 266 balls for his 96, caught at slip off a ball that kicked off a good length, could Pakistan assume victory.” Gavaskar was named player of the match but true to his word, Imran’s Pakistan won the five-match series 1-0.

Title: More than just a name: Kerala pacer Eden Apple Tom stuns Vidarbha in Ranji Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/more-than-just-a-name-kerala-pacer-eden-apple-tom-stuns-vidarbha-in-ranji-trophy-final-9859786/
Content:
The moment Eden Apple Tom was listed in Kerala’s team sheet, everyone became an onomastic, digging the roots of the name. Curiosity around his name swirled: “Is it Eeden or Aiden, or Edhan or Edan?” “Is he from a religious background?” “Who is Apple, his second name, or his father’s name?” Convoluted associations with Garden of Eden and Eden Gardens too were not far behind. Eden himself must have been asked to detail the etymology of his name a hundred times, by his friends, teammates, teachers, colleagues, coaches and journalists. He had to clarify: “My name is Eden. And Apple is my fathers’s name.” The name, phonetically spelled, is Adhan, the Malayalam equivalent of Eden.
On Thursday, he ensured that the onlookers remembered his bowling too, that there is more to him than his name. He designed the right-arm seamer’s perfect ball from around the stumps to devour Yash Rathod, Vidarbha’s batting figurehead, and catalysed Kerala’s second-day fightback.
The third ball of his first over of the second spell, he conjured a ball so dreamy that Rathod’s lips gasped into a perfectly round ‘O’. Just 66 runs away from scaling the 1000-run peak in the season, Rathod nicked a ball outside the off-stump, like a firefly drawn irresistibly into the light. He could have shouldered arms, if only he had a divine premonition of the ball’s wicked path. It angled inward from around the stumps, curling a smidgeon as it reached him. But in exemplary form, the inward shape did not trick his eyes into turning leg-side. He second-guessed the away-swing bluff, the seam canting towards the first slip was a giveaway, except that he did not expect the ball to seam away so deviously late or subtly. Or that, Eden had managed to draw him further across the off stump (or where he imagined his off-stump was), without him realising it and cajoled him into edging a ball that he could have left alone.
It was quick-kill. Kerala had little cushion to lay elaborate traps. So, the first two balls to him were full—the first on the fourth stump and the next on off-stump, tailing into him. The third ball, Rathod listened to the crack of doom.
The schemer was captain Sachin Baby. Every time Eden returned to the run-up point, with hurried strides, his fingers flicking an imaginary ball, Sachin would sidle up and whisper some advice. Eden, 19 and fresh-faced, who was four years old when Sachin debuted, would vigorously nod his head like an obedient pupil would a mentor. As he broke into his long and brisk run-up, the usually quiet Baby would scream: “Mone, polilku!” Son, have a blast.
A young Eden was a pacer with precious gifts that his academy coach in Dubai, and former captain Sony Cheruvathoor, advised him to relocate to Thiruvananthapuram so that he could professionally embrace the game. His father, Apple, had to quit his job in the Dubai Airport, but Cheruvathoor convinced him that relocation would be worth the sacrifice. Recollects Cheruvathoor: “I remember a young boy at the academy, (in Dubai) he might have been 8 or 9. He was quick for his age, and had a great willingness to learn. I saw some genuine talent in him and when I returned to Thiruvananthapuram, I asked him to relocate.”
A diamond in the rough, he required polishing. Like he was bowling off the wrong foot, the action put a lot of strain on lower back and knees. But by 15, Sony and coaches at the Love All Sports Academy sculpted him into a bowler good enough to summon the attention of then state coach Tinu Yohannan. He was invited to the senior camp, where he impressed one and all. A year later, Tinu handed him his maiden Ranji cap, against Meghalaya. Having made a habit of making first impressions, he struck with his first ball, grabbed six wickets in the game and was adjudged man of the match. By the time he played his next game, against Gujarat, he was already a household name in his State. “From a young age, he had a lovely in-swinger. But he wanted the out-swinger too, and worked incredibly hard to develop it,” says Cheruvathoor.
A stress fracture on the lower back decelerated his progress, but he not only recovered from a potentially career-ending injury, but also has returned without losing much of his pace and vim. Cheruvathoor credits it to his mental strength as well as the strong fundamentals of the game. He has a gliding run-up that gives him the impetus to produce nippy pace, a frictionless leap and a fluent action that sustains the momentum. He can be both quicker and bouncier—like Ajit Agarkar—than the batsmen think he could be. Akshay Wadkar felt the sting of his extra bounce. He wafted at a short ball, but it bounced more than he judged and edged behind. It was an equally important wicket, as the experienced hand was in the mood for quick runs that would have dragged Kerala out of the game.
He is far from a finished product—rough edges linger, scattergun properties remain—but Eden gave Kerala a glimpse of the promised land. And ensured those that remember his name would recollect the dream ball to Rathod too.

Title: Women’s Premier League: Chamari Athapaththu leaves UP Warriorz for national duties, Aussie young gun named replacement
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/womens-premier-league-chamari-athapaththu-leaves-up-warriorz-for-national-duties-aussie-young-gun-named-replacement-9859690/
Content:
UP Warriorz announced on Thursday that Chamari Athapaththu will be replaced by young Aussie star Georgia Voll in their squad for Women’s Premier League 2025 season that is past the midway stage. Athapaththu will be resuming national duties for Sri Lanka, the league said in a statement.
Sri Lankan superstar Athapaththu hadn’t played a single game for UPW in the ongoing season. Voll might not be a like-for-like replacement for Athapaththu in terms of experience, with the 21-year-old making her international debut only end of last year. But she comes with a reputation of being a big hitter at the top of the order as Indian cricket followers would be able to attest to. Replacing an injured Alyssa Healy in India’s recent series Down Under, scoring a century in just her second ODI. She then went on to make her T20I and Test debut during the women’s Ashes series.
Voll had a breakthrough WBBL season with the Sydney Thunder when she smashed 330 run in 12 matches at a strike rate of 144.73, with a highest score of 97*. The Australian batter will join UPW for Rs 30 Lakh.
UPW have had a up and down start to the season, without regular captain Healy in their ranks. Deepti Sharma was named the captain for this season, and while they won arguably the match of the tournament so far when they overcame RCB after a Super Over in Bengaluru, consistency has eluded them. UP Warriorz next move to Lucknow for their home leg, playing at the Ekana Stadium for the first stadium.

Title: IPL 2025: Kevin Pietersen named Delhi Capitals mentor

Content:
Former England captain Kevin Pietersen was named the Delhi Capitals mentor for the IPL 2025 season on Thursday. The 44-year-old Pietersen will be seen in a coaching assignment for the first time in the IPL since last featuring as a player in the league in 2016. “It’s an exciting opportunity to step into this new role as a mentor for the Capitals,” Pietersen said in a DC press release. “And I’m really looking forward to joining the squad, working closely with the boys, and doing everything I can to help us win that ultimate prize.”
Pietersen played for three IPL teams across five seasons from 2009, including Delhi (then Daredevils). He also led in 17 matches in the IPL. After leading Royal Challengers Bengaluru briefly in IPL 2009, Pietersen captained Daredevils in 2014 when they finished at the bottom of the league table with only two wins.
I’m so excited to come home to Delhi! I have the fondest memories of my time with Delhi. I love the city, I love the fans and I’ll do everything I can to support the franchise in our quest for the title in 2025! https://t.co/ln2ldwKHAz
— Kevin Pietersen🦏 (@KP24) February 27, 2025
https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js
“I’ve got incredible memories of representing the Delhi franchise in the IPL, and I’ve been able to maintain that passion for the team even as a broadcaster over the years. I shared the field with Venu (Venugopal Rao) during the 2012 season, and it’s great to be reconnecting with him as we begin a new chapter at this amazing franchise.”
In a T20 career spanning 200 matches, Pietersen scored 5695 runs at an average of 33.89 and strike rate just below 137. Pietersen will join Hemang Badani (head coach), Matthew Mott (assistant coach), Munaf Patel (bowling coach) and Venugopal Rao (director of cricket) in the Delhi support staff.
DC finished sixth in IPL 2024 and have only reached the final once in 2020 where they lost to the Mumbai Indians. Heading into the IPL 2025 auction with the biggest purse after retaining only Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs and Abishek Porel, Delhi snapped up big signings in KL Rahul, Harry Brook, Faf du Plessis and Mitchell Starc.
The team has yet to announce a captain ahead of the IPL season, due to begin on March 22. Delhi play their first league game against Lucknow Super Giants on March 24 in Vizag.

Title: ‘You think we’ll come only to play with Maxwell?’ – Afghanistan captain Shahidi miffed ahead of Australia Champions Trophy clash

Afghanistan captain Hashmatullah Shahidi and his team would have taken a while to recover from the Glenn Maxwell hurricane that wreaked havoc over them at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai during the 2023 ODI World Cup.
Chasing 292, Australia were staring at a certain defeat after losing seven wickets with less than 100 on the board, but then, Maxwell played one of the greatest knocks in the history of one-day cricket to steer his side into an unbelievable win, and days later, the Aussies won a record-extending sixth World Cup. Dropped on 33, Maxwell finished unbeaten on 201 after battling cramps and unleashing an extraordinary range of shots.
Though the Afghans exacted their revenge with a win that shut Australia’s knockout chances at the T20 World Cup last year, Shahidi was posed the Glenn Maxwell question ahead of a virtual knockout clash between Afghanistan and Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Friday.
“You think we will come only to play with Maxwell? Do you think it will be like that? We have planned for entire Australian team, and I know that he (Maxwell) played really well in the 2023 World Cup, but that’s part of the history,” a miffed Shahidi said at the pre-match press conference on Thursday.
“After that, we beat them in T20 World Cup, and we think about all opposition team. We are not coming to the ground to plan on individual players. We will try our best to come with the planning, and we are not playing only Maxwell – we are playing Australia,” Shahidi said.
The victory against England sparked wild celebrations in the Afghan capital of Kabul where fireworks were lit and streets were filled with jubilant fans. Should Afghanistan get past Australia, it will pave the way for their second successive entry into the semifinals of an ICC event in less than a year, following their inspiring run in the T20 World Cup in the Americas in 2024.
“I think it will be a good game for cricket, and our focus will be to keep things simple and don’t worry much about playing semifinal. We will try to do our basics well, and we will try to come to the ground with good planning,” Shahidi said. “Afghan people always cheer for us, as you saw (against England) in the ground. There were a lot of our Afghan people. So, their support is always with us, and wherever we go, they support us,” Shahidi added.

Title: Monty Panesar interview: England missed another batsman to support Joe Root at Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/monty-panesar-interview-england-champions-trophy-exit-odi-batting-9859039/
Content:
Because of The Hundred, a lot of the batters tend to focus on T20 cricket back home. And you’re getting a lot of batters now who are declining county contracts and want to just play franchise cricket around the world because it can earn more money. It is something that is a bit of a concern for England as they may end up producing T20 batters and not batters for ODIs
Probably the strategy. They didn’t prepare a proper second spinner to support Adil Rashid and they just went with fast bowlers. They thought having four or five 90-plus miles fast bowlers would help them win games, but that didn’t help on pitches in Pakistan.
We have seen England succeed with an all-attacking approach from 2015-19 in ODI cricket but in the last few years, it has not given good results. What do you think has changed?
Yeah, because they had batsmen who could bat for longer periods and now they relied just on (Joe) Root. They could have possibly had another batsman there, like maybe Harry Brook, thinking right, these are the two batsmen who are going to bat longer period while the others can attack a bit more. They were just missing another batsman. Root came into the team because he can anchor the innings but then yesterday, all Root needed was a batsman to bat with him and they probably would have beaten Afghanistan. That didn’t happen and from that point of view, they were missing one batter to support Root because all the other batsmen are quite attacking. Eoin Morgan’s team just had batters who could bat time. I think here, they have batters who have impact but they don’t look to bat time.
What do you mean by batting time and Morgan? They too have posted some very big totals in their time and played many innings of impact.
Yeah, but then the roles were a bit more clear as well. Look at someone like Jason Roy, he did really well. Jonny Bairstow did good as well. There were two key batters. There were two or three batters who could actually just hit the ball and bat time. But now they only have one, Root, who actually had to come in because they didn’t have a batsman who could bat the whole 50 overs because they all just sort of hit the ball and played more T20-style cricket. So I think what they should have done was set the innings up for the 35th or the 40th over, have wickets in hand, and then tell the guys to go hard. And that’s what Morgan’s team used to do. They would bat until 35 overs and then they’d go hard. Now, they’re just going hard from ball one. And I don’t think that strategy has worked for their batting.
India changed their approach in white-ball cricket after they lost to England in the 2022 World Cup semifinal in Adelaide. Rohit Sharma has led from the front but India continue to get the tempo right in ODI cricket. What do you think they are doing right?
Yeah, I suppose, when you’ve got Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, you have probably one of the two best batsmen India’s produced in ODI cricket. And they’re playing together and they’re in good form. It helps the rest of the guys. Shubman Gill is another one. He’s world-class, he’s the world’s best batsman. So India has batters who can attack but also these three batters, they can bat for long periods and they can keep the tempo going. India has more batsmen similar to Root’s style. And England need a couple of batters like that. Rohit, Kohli and Gill are three batters who bat through the innings. And that allows someone like Hardik Pandya to come in and just play impact innings. He can whack it out of the ground. And then, you know, it allows Axar Patel to come in and whack it as well. So they’ve got a lot more all-rounders but they’ve got good, proper batters who can just bat long periods. And I think that’s the difference.
Who are the good players from current England domestic cricket who can bat well in ODI cricket?
It’s just a mind-shift at the moment. There are young batters who are coming through like Jacob Bethell and they talk a lot about him. But he’s still young, learning his game. There isn’t really any batsman coming through at the moment that you think, yeah, this guy can bat long periods. I think because of the Hundred, a lot of the batters tend to sort of focus on T20 cricket back home. And you’re getting a lot of batters now who are declining county contracts and actually want to just play franchise cricket around the world because it can earn more money. They’ll end up moving to Dubai as their home and a few players are starting to do that. It is something that is a bit of a concern for England that in the future you may just see more players not playing county cricket, moving to Dubai and playing these franchise cricket leagues because they can earn more money. And England could end up producing T20 batters and not batters for ODI cricket. And that could be a danger for England in the future.
What do you think is the right approach to win? Is it having a philosophy and picking your team accordingly or setting the style of play with the players available?
That style of old, let’s say traditional England style of batting where you just bat slightly longer, you set the game up. Afghanistan did it perfectly. You look at Australia, they obviously, do it really well. They’ve got Steve Smith there. So, it’s just about actually setting the innings up rather than going in and thinking, right, let’s keep creating impact. In ODI, it’s a slightly longer format of the game. So, if we have wickets in hand by 35 overs, let’s say seven or six wickets in hand by 35 overs, then you can accelerate. Afghanistan did that. They got to the 40th over. They were, like in a really good position and they accelerated.
And the last 10, they got 100. England got it wrong where they could have just said, right, let’s keep, you know, let’s only be three or four down by 35 to 40th over. Then, in the last 10 overs, we go hard. Or the last 15 overs, we play T20 cricket. Let’s just bat until the 35th. That would have been a better strategy. But they just kept on going, they kept on attacking hard. I think it wasn’t the right option.

Title: ‘Never looked at Jos Buttler and thought ‘wow what a leader’ – Nasser Hussain reckons England captain’s time is up

Former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton slammed Jos Buttler’s leadership after the team’s stunning Champions Trophy 2025 exit on Wednesday, following their eight-run defeat to Afghanistan in Lahore.
England’s string of defeats extended to seven straight matches since the India tour under Buttler’s leadership, with the captain himself struggling to contribute with the bat, scoring 23 and 38 in two games against Australia and Afghanistan.
In a post-match chat with Atherton, Buttler conceded that he will take time to reflect on his position after heading back home. Meanwhile, Atherton and Hussain remarked that the captaincy tag never really suited Buttler, who took over from Eoin Morgan in mid-2022.
“I think his time is done as captain,” Atherton said on Sky Sports. “I think that’s probably right. England do judge themselves on these ICC events, they’ve made that very clear, that because they come along so frequently now, they build towards these tournaments.
“But England have had three bad ones in a row now, the disastrous 50-over World Cup in India, a poor T20 World Cup in the Caribbean – where they made the semis but they didn’t beat anybody of note through it – and now here, and their cricket is way below the standards which they set themselves.
“Sometimes you just have to say it’s not working and therefore it’s time for a change and time for somebody else, and I think deep down, he probably knows that,” Atherton added.
Meanwhile, Hussain said that Buttler could not command a persona like Morgan on the field while leading the side.
“I’ve never looked at Buttler and thought ‘wow what a leader,’ he doesn’t have that presence in the field that an Eoin Morgan had,” Hussain said. “That’s a bad comparison because you’re talking about England’s greatest-ever white-ball captain, and he was a hard act to follow.
“As far as captaincy goes, I don’t think Buttler has added that much to this England team, but it’s taken away from his batting. And when you add the two together, take away from a great player and you’re not gaining with leadership and captaincy, I think it’s probably time to move on.”

Title: Pakistan vs Bangladesh: What to expect from Rawalpindi weather?

When Pakistan play in their final game of the Champions Trophy 2025, an event which they’re hosting, they will have one eye on the sky in Rawalpindi. This is because the venue saw a wash out of the Champions Trophy game between Australia and South Africa. Another rain-marred game would be a particularly grim way for the hosts Pakistan to end their Champions Trophy 2025 campaign where little has gone their way.
On Thursday, the toss was delayed indefinitely after steady showers put the start in jeopardy. The weather forecast has predicted persistent rains throughout the afternoon in Rawalpindi.

Pakistan and Bangladesh are both eliminated from Group A while India and New Zealand have already secured their semi-final spots. So this game will be to decide which team finishes third. Pakistan will want to beat Bangladesh and at least end the tournament with a consolatory win.
The pitch at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium is expected to be on the slower side given the muggy climate with the seamers receiving assistance. IF the past is any indication, pacers might receive some early assistance. But as the game progresses, the surface is likely to favour batters. Spinners could find some grip on the surface when it starts deteriorating.
The weather forecast for Rawalpindi for Thursday predicts a cloudy evening with occasional showers in the afternoon. Temperatures are likely to hover in the low 20s, with precipitation chances shooting up to nearly 88 percent.

Title: ‘Am I part of the problem or solution’: Jos Buttler on England captaincy future after Champions Trophy exit

Content:
England’s eight-run defeat to Afghanistan in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 encounter at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Wednesday has unsettled the former world champions’ set-up, with skipper Jos Buttler contemplating his future in the role after another group-stage exit.
In a do-or-die contest, England came up eight runs short as Afghanistan put on an inspired performance to pile on 325 runs on the back of opener Ibrahim Zadran’s 177 and held their nerves to see off the 2019 World Cup winners. The defeat marked England’s seventh successive loss under Buttler’s captaincy starting from last month’s tour to India. After being blanked 3-0 in the ODIs in India, England’s Champions Trophy got off on a wry note after they failed to defend another 300-plus score against a depleted Australia.
The Champions Trophy is the third ICC tournament in as many years where Buttler and Co. have failed to reach the knockouts. While the England captain admitted that he would not take any hasty decisions, Buttler said it might be the right time for introspection.
“Yeah, I think the results aren’t where they need to be and I need to consider all possibilities. And like I said we need to get us as a team back to where England cricket needs to be in the white ball formats. And I think I’ve got to work out personally am I part of the problem or am I part of the solution?”
“As I said, I’m not going to make any emotional decisions right here, right now. You’re probably not the first people I’d discuss that with. And take a little bit of time to just work out personally what I think is right. And obviously, the guys at the top are in charge and they will have their views as well – so as I said, we need to get the team back to where it needs to be – competing to win these tournaments and as I said I’ve got to work out – am I part of the solution or not?” Buttler added.
With only a solitary hundred to his name in his last 58 white-ball games for England, Buttler was asked whether the leadership tag was taking a toll.
“It’s had its moments for sure. I know lots of people think it doesn’t sit well with me being captain and that kind of thing but I really do enjoy it. I enjoy leading. Even before when I wasn’t captain I’d like to think of myself as a leader in the team. But, results are tough and they weigh heavy at times. And, of course, you want to be leading a winning team and we haven’t been that for a while now so obviously that brings some difficult moments,” said Buttler.

Title: Ravi Shastri’s blunt message for England after Champions Trophy exit: ‘Take playing in sub-continent seriously’

Content:
England’s desperate push for a win in a high-scoring thriller in Lahore on Wednesday ended in defeat with Afghanistan stunning Jos Buttler’s men with an eight-run victory to keep themselves afloat in Group B of the Champions Trophy.
Despite an impressive start with the ball where Afghanistan shrunk to 37 for three, opener Ibrahim Zadran set forth a resounding comeback for his side. Zadran clobbered a career-best 177 off 146 deliveries, his innings studded with 12 fours and six maximums as Afghanistan put on a mammoth 325 for seven on the board.
England’s chase progressively stiffened with Afghanistan pegging the former world champions back with regular wickets. Even as No. 4 Joe Root put on a clinical century to keep the chase alive, the Afghan bowlers held their nerves to inflict England’s fifth successive defeat since their recent tour to India, also knocking them out of the Champions Trophy.
Afghanistan. You guys rock. Kammaaal Kaardi. For England. Take playing in the Subcontinent seriously with no excuses. Only then you will be recognised as a Team that can TRAVEL #AFGvENG #ChampionsTrophy2025 pic.twitter.com/6dUYlzAVc5
— Ravi Shastri (@RaviShastriOfc) February 26, 2025
Following Afghanistan’s emphatic win, former India head coach Ravi Shastri took to social media to applaud the side while signalling a stern message for the Englishmen. “Afghanistan. You guys rock. Kammaaal Kaardi. For England. Take playing in the Subcontinent seriously with no excuses. Only then you will be recognised as a Team that can TRAVEL #AFGvENG #ChampionsTrophy2025,” Shastri wrote.
England’s white-ball sides have been on a downhill since their T20 World Cup triumph in 2022. In the previous ODI World Cup in 2023 and last year’s T20 World Cup, England failed to go past the league stage.
“Brilliant from Afghanistan .. Throughly deserved win .. England just haven’t played good enough white ball cricket for a couple of years .. this result isn’t a surprise in these conditions,” former England captain Michael Vaughan later wrote on X.

Title: Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma might be rested for New Zealand game
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-rohit-sharma-hamstring-injury-rest-india-vs-new-zealand-9858575/
Content:
So far, it has been a smooth campaign for India at the Champions Trophy, but ahead of their last group match against New Zealand, they are sweating over the availability of skipper Rohit Sharma.
During their match on Sunday, in the early part of Pakistan’s innings, Rohit was seen struggling with his hamstring after a long chase to the boundary. Later on, he even walked off the field for a brief while with Shubman Gill taking charge.
But Rohit came back and marshalled his troops before opening the batting with Gill in India’s successful chase.
However, as India trained on Wednesday after a two-day break, Rohit was the lone frontline batsman not to get into the nets. Instead, he stayed indoors and later on, was seen working with the strength and conditioning coach and physiotherapist. While he did jog for a while, he wasn’t pushing himself to the full extent.
With India scheduled to play New Zealand and their semifinal on Tuesday after just one day’s gap, the next couple of days could well decide whether Rohit takes the field on Sunday or not. With the team already making the semifinals, they have the option to not risk Rohit against New Zealand. But with Afghanistan beating England, a match India keenly followed at the conclusion of the three-hour nets session, they still don’t know who their opponents in the semifinals will be. They will get a clear idea of whom they will face after the matches on the weekend.
With Rohit’s fitness being a concern, India are looking at Rishabh Pant and Washington Sundar as back-ups. Both left-handers trained extensively, alternating between the two nets where spinners and pacers were operating.
However in case Rohit is indeed unavailable for the game, it would be interesting to see who opens alongside Gill. In KL Rahul, they have an opener who can slot in easily at the top, but that would mean disturbing a settled middle order before the knockouts.

Defending Pakistan will look to bow out of the Champions Trophy that they’re hosting with at least a win against fellow strugglers Bangladesh, who have also been knocked out of the event. Both teams have lost both their group stage games so far, so today’s game offers them the opportunity to salvage some pride. The game is being played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi, which saw the previous game it was hosting — between South Africa and Australia — get washed out due to rains. Pakistan, at least, would be hoping their campaign does not end with a rain-enforced coup de grace.

Pakistan have crashed and burned in the Champions Trophy, despite coming into the event as the defending champions and the hosts. Their top stars have flattered to deceive in the Champions Trophy, which is why they’re playing against Bangladesh in the final game of the 2025 Champions Trophy with nothing more than pride on the line.
Pakistan might try and reason that they were hamstrung by injuries to players like Saim Ayub (ankle injury) and Fakhar Zaman (who was injury on the second ball of the tournament). But big-names like Babar Azam, Saud Shakeel, and Mohammad Rizwan have not delivered with the bat. Meanwhile, the pace trio of Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Naseem Shah has also been inconsistent.

Shaheen Shah Afridi has had a wretched tournament so far in Pakistan. He’s claimed two wickets in two games at the Champions Trophy, besides having a lacklustre event at the tri-series which was played as a build-up for the Champions Trophy. many former Pakistan cricketers like Wasim Akram and Mohammad Hafeez have roundly slammed him for this. With the tournament already done and dusted, Mohammad Hasnain could replace Shaheen in the XI.

Title: How Joe Root’s ramp shot gave Afghanistan a new lease of life and paved the way for their thrilling win
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-joe-root-ramp-shot-paved-way-afghanistan-thrilling-win-9858291/
Content:
The winning moment for Afghanistan couldn’t have been scripted better in Lahore. Azmatullah Omarzai picked up his fifth wicket to go with his crucial 41. The ball went to Ibrahim Zadran at long off who held onto the catch. He had batted from the start of the Afghanistan innings till the last over earlier in the afternoon for a record-breaking 177 off 146 balls, now the highest individual score in Champions Trophy history as well as for Afghanistan in this format.
As Adil Rashid was dismissed, Afghanistan made back-to-back wins against England in ICC ODI events, after having defeated the then-reigning World Champions in the 2023 World Cup in Delhi. Chasing 326 to stay alive in the tournament, England fell short by 8 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium and will be exiting another ICC event early.
As long as Joe Root was in the middle, England hoped. Batting on 99, he tapped the ball through square leg and took off, desperately wanting a second run, more than reaching a ton. As he completed the milestone, he stretched his legs before acknowledging the applause briefly, and without any over-the-top celebrations. He knew England were on the brink of losing if he didn’t finish the job there. While his strokeplay continued to be impeccable, it was now down to sheer will. After reducing the equation down once more with a boundary in the 46th over, Root put his head down and ran a double. He was gasping for breath at this point, the body was being pushed to the limits. Could he have maybe, for a conservative option, settled for a single that ball? Jamie Overton was proving to be an able partner at the other end after all.
Omarzai read the situation. The allrounder, who was named 2024’s ICC Men’s ODI Cricketer of the Year, dug in a short ball, Root arched his overloaded body backward and tried to ramp it over the wicketkeeper’s head. But the tired limbs meant he could only glove it to wicketkeeper Rahmanullah Gurbaz. In hindsight, that was the clincher for Afghanistan as Root trudged back to the dressing room – at the slowest walking pace one can imagine – out on 120, out of gas.
Omarzai kept picking up the crucial wickets all night. He struck early, Phil Salt removed after only sprinkling the match with a couple of boundaries for taste. With the match entering near even territory in the 37th over, Omarzai got rid of the England captain. Jos Buttler too fell to a delivery that was dug into the pitch and the pull shot was miscued, landing straight into the hands of deep square leg. Then, of course, came Root’s wicket. Even after that, Overton kept England on course to sneak past the finish line and Omarzai had him caught at long on. The Adil Rashid wicket was the icing on the cake.
All’s well that ends well for Afghanistan, but they were off to a rough start. At a venue where Australia chased down more than 350, it was a brave call from Hashmatullah Shahidi to bat first. But he was backing what his side were good at. Chasing hasn’t been Afghanistan’s strong suit, so he stuck to that. But with Jofra Archer moving the ball back in, Mark Wood shaping it away – both men doing it at red-hot speeds – Afghanistan’s top order struggled, losing three wickets in the first 10 overs, all to Archer.
But up stepped Zadran and how. In Shahidi, he then found a steadying hand as Afghanistan rebuilt their innings. With the run rate ticking over 4.0 at the halfway stage, Zadran played one of the shots of the afternoon as he lofted Overton down the ground for a glorious four. The next over from the right-arm pacer went for 16 runs as Ibrahim hit another straight six, this time a power swat off a short ball, then followed it up with two well-timed fours on the leg side. In their 100-run partnership, the first 50 runs came off 80 balls while the next 50 took just 49.
After losing Shahidi, Zadran found another able ally in Omarzai who came out with plenty of intent and didn’t let the momentum slip. And when he fell at the start of the last 10, Mohammed Nabi didn’t waste time to get going as well. The turning point came when England started leaking runs in the death overs, the chaos of losing Wood to an injury in the 43rd, with two overs of his quota still left didn’t help Buttler. Zadran recognised the opening and shifted gears once more, plundering 20 runs off the 44th that was bowled by Archer. Root had to bowl the 47th over and Nabi made the most of that too. “England are falling apart in Lahore,” said former captain Mike Atherton on air, prophetically as it turned out.
In the last 10 overs, Afghanistan scored 113/2 and when even 280+ looked improbable not long back, Zadran and Co had powered them to a winning total.

Title: Azmatullah Omarzai: Afghanistan’s hero vs England was once forbidden from leaving home at night

Afghanistan defeated England by eight runs in a thrilling Champions Trophy clash that went to the last over. While Ibrahim Zadran scored 177 runs — a record score in the Champions Trophy — in the first innings to help the side set a total of 325/7, it was Azmatullah Omarzai who also helped him with a 31-ball 41. Then, he helped the Asian side win by claiming five wickets in their defence of 326.
Omarzai ended with figures of five wickets for 58 runs from his 9.5 overs. Among his five wickets, he claimed the wickets of Jos Buttler, centurion Joe Root and Jamie Overton, who was threatening to take England over the line to victory.
The 24-year-old Omarzai is an all-rounder for Afghanistan. He made his ODI debut for Afghanistan in January 2021 and a debut in the shortest format of the game a year later. 2023, though, was his breakout year. He scored his maiden half-century in ODIs against Bangladesh in July 2023. Then, he scored 62 against India in the World Cup.
He’s also played for Gujarat Titans in the IPL. He was 2024’s ICC Men’s ODI Cricketer of the Year.
Omarzai grew up in Nangarhar, playing cricket on the streets. But he and his brothers were not allowed to step outside the house after sunset. Why? Because their region was one of the strongholds of Tehreek-e-Taliban, who were battling against the Pakistan army.
In 2014, when Afghanistan beat Bangladesh for the first time, in an Asia Cup game, Omarzai’s father asked the 14-year-old what he wanted to do when he grew up. He replied instantly: he wanted to become a cricketer because he loved cricket more than anything else.
“In 2014, me and my family were watching Afghanistan’s match against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup. Afghanistan won that match and even my father, who did not understand much about the sport, enjoyed the experience. He used to ask us what was happening whenever we celebrated any four or six hit by our team. He celebrated Afghanistan’s victory and gave us the car keys to go out and celebrate even though we were not allowed to roam out in the evenings,” Omarzai had told the Afghanistan Cricket Board’s (ACB) YouTube channel in 2021.
“When we came back, my father asked me if I wanted to become a cricketer. I told him that I had loved the game for a long time and played tennis-ball street cricket. After that, my father allowed me to play,” he said.
His start in the sport began as a “impact sub”.
“I have sweet memories of street cricket. My elder brothers used to play tennis-ball cricket. One day, they needed a player and decided to take me in. During the match, the situation at one time was such that the opposition needed only 15-16 runs with five wickets in hand. The captain threw me the ball. I used to bowl off-breaks back then. I grabbed the opportunity and turned around the match by taking four wickets in a single over and we won the match,” he said.
It took Omarzai barely four years from playing on the street with a tennis ball to representing the Afghanistan U-19 team at the 2018 World Cup.
In the quarter-final of the U19 World Cup, Omarzai smashed a 23-ball 66, which included seven maximums, against hosts New Zealand to help Afghanistan win by 202 runs.
“The U-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand was a great experience and a great start to my career. Against New Zealand, Ibrahim Zadran, Gurbaz and Basheer Shah gave us a brilliant start. Then I went in and executed the plan and the role that the coach had given me as a finisher. It was the first match I played which was broadcast live,” Omarzai recalled.

Title: Cues from Indian nets: how Virat Kohli’s way to play spin differed from Shreyas Iyer and Hardik Pandya
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-nets-virat-kohli-way-to-play-spin-differed-shreyas-iyer-hardik-pandya-9858242/
Content:
After a well earned two-day break, India returned to the training fold at the ICC Academy grounds on Wednesday. With their semi-final spot confirmed, their third match against New Zealand may not be a must-win fixture, but it will no doubt be the first stiff challenge they face.
With the Black Caps having a rounded attack to suit the conditions in Dubai, India will have their task cut out on Sunday. The conditions, which have been on the slower side in the two matches, are expected to slow further. Soon after India completed their win over Pakistan, the groundstaff immediately watered the entire square. With at least two matches to come in the space of three days, it is understood that fresh pitches will be used for the two matches with the centre strip being kept aside for the final (should it happen here).
With adequate watering and one week gap, India believe there is a good chance for the pitches to retain its same characteristics as one saw against Bangladesh and Pakistan. New Zealand with its three-prone spin attack that includes skipper Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips will pose all sorts of questions to this Indian batting line-up that has struggled off-late against tweakers in similar conditions. New Zealand after all had inflicted plenty of wounds to this team, which they would like to reopen.
At their three-hour net session on a chilly evening, their planning revolved around the matchups they will confront on Sunday. Apart from Shubman Gill who didn’t turn up and skipper Rohit Sharma, who didn’t bat, the rest of the batting line-up had an extensive outing.
Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel displayed contrasting approaches to tackle spin at the nets. For instance, Shreyas and Axar who have been alternating at No 4, showed the intent to go on the offensive straightaway. Scoring in the middle-overs hasn’t been easy against spinners and with Santner and Bracewell being in good rhythm, Shreyas and Axar went about charging Ravindra Jadeja and Varun Chakaravarthy. Even Washington Sundar, who hasn’t played a game so far — but could come in should India tweak their option as New Zealand has three left-handers in the top 5 – followed a similar approach.
Kohli, on the other hand, started off by facing the seamers Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana , against whom he was seen playing aggressive shots. But the moment he switched to the nets where the spinners were operating, he predominantly played the angles using the nudges and wrists. Against Pakistan, in the middle-overs, it was his running between the wickets – 13×2 and 46×1 – that kept the scoreboard ticking. He nurdled Jadeja late behind the square while ensuring he wasn’t closing the bat face soon. Later on, he used the wrists to hit the spinners towards the cow-corner. But it also led to him mistiming a few and missing it as playing across the line against spinners has been his biggest undoing off late.
The power-hitters
Beyond the trio are KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya, the two India bet on to provide the final flourish when batting first. At the nets, they switched between facing the spinners and seamers. But with both of them one aspect stood out – unless the deliveries were short, they mostly tried to go in the V, a safe bet in any conditions. And when they did so, they repeatedly cleared the huge boundaries with minimum effort against both the spinners and seamers.
Even Harshit Rana, who followed them at the nets, indulged in some power-hitting with the pacer muscling a couple of big hits that went the distance.
Sweeps and reverse-sweeps
It may not be the go-to shot for most of the current Indian batsmen, but over here the likes of Kohli, Shreyas, Axar and Rahul repeatedly brought it out. During the tour to Sri Lanka, where they hardly employed the sweep, India struggled to release the pressure when spinners operated and ended up playing high-risk shots that brought about their downfall. So over here, apart from Rahul and Axar who struck to the conventional sweep, others deployed the paddle-sweep and the slog-sweep to good effect. And every now and then, a reverse sweep will come out indicating their preparedness for the Kiwi challenge.

The Afghanistan dugout ran in jubilation as Ibrahim Zadran grabbed the catch of Adil Rashid to knock England out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 on Wednesday at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.
Afghanistan defeated England by eight runs in a thrilling finish and won on the second-last delivery of the game. With Afghanistan’s win, group A of the tournament is wide open with all three teams having a chance.
Ibrahim Zadran played a magnificent innings of 177 runs in 146 balls to power Afghanistan to a big total of 325/7 from 50 overs. Joe Root scored 120 for England but the Afghani bowlers showed immense composure in the last few overs to get the crucial wickets and restrict England to 317 all out to clinch the thriller.
At the moment, South Africa is at the top of the group with three points and ahead of second-placed Australia based on net run rate as their game was washed out due to rain on Monday. Afghanistan is placed third with two points as they lost the first game against South Africa.
With just two games left in the group, there is a huge possibility that either of the three teams can go ahead or go home.
Afghanistan has just one option and that is to win against Australia in their last. In any case, if Afghanistan loses, South Africa will qualify automatically as they have three points.
Scenario 1: If Afghanistan defeats Australia and South Africa loses against England by a big margin, Australia will qualify for the semi-finals.
Scenario 2: If Afghanistan defeats Australia and South Africa wins against England, Australia will be knocked out of the tournament while SA will qualify for the semis.
Scenario 3: If Afghanistan defeats Australia and South Africa loses against England by a small margin, South Africa will qualify for the semis based on net run rate.

In India’s ICC Champions Trophy victory against Pakistan, Virat Kohli’s century (100* on 111 balls) was a key ingredient. But Kuldeep Yadav was the secret spice for India as he played an important role in reducing Pakistan to 241.
The subtle nature of Kuldeep Yadav’s art makes him stand out from some of the best wrist-spinners in the history of the game, including the likes of Shane Warne and Anil Kumble.
It’s this quality that bamboozles batsmen when they attempt to target Kuldeep at the business end of limited-overs games. Take the match against Pakistan at the ICC Champions Trophy, for example.
Pakistan had reached 200/5 with eight overs left in their innings. Salman Ali Agha and Khushdil Shah had a good partnership going and were looking to take their side to a strong total.
When they saw the ball being handed to Kuldeep, they thought their opportunity had arrived. Salman tried to go for a big shot to an overspun stock delivery, but the ball didn’t go where it was intended to. The right-hander couldn’t read the 83 kph cross-seam delivery and tried to flick it towards the legside, only managing to find Ravindra Jadeja at cover- point.
Kuldeep’s variations can puzzle even the best of batsmen, so it was no surprise that next man Shaheen Shah Afridi was all at sea.
A back-of-the-hand googly trapped the left-hander on the crease. It landed on the fourth-stump line and caught Afridi plumb in front. The ball darted in quickly, leaving very little reaction time for the batsman, who shaped to defend it on the backfoot before attempting a flick in vain, but couldn’t get bat on ball.
The two back-to-back wickets put Pakistan behind the eight-ball, but Naseem Shah has the capability to send the ball out the ground in the final few overs. Kuldeep ensured that he couldn’t do much damage.
It was a full length delivery, bowled on off- and middle-stump. Trying to go big over long-on, Naseem couldn’t judge the sudden dip and chipped it to the deep fielder. Along with spin and pace variation, what makes Kuldeep special is how he holds up the ball.
Despite going wicketless in the first six overs of his spell, conceding 28 runs, Kuldeep kept the batsmen honest, by reading the game and the batsmen’s minds, which makes him a big asset at the back-end of the innings.
Also, he has the uncanny ability to make quality batsmen look silly. A classic example is Babar Azam’s dismissal in the 2019 ODI World Cup. The delivery was tossed up at 78 kph, and drew the batsman forward before pitching and spinning back 5.8 degrees to strike the off-stump. It is this sudden change of pace and rotation of the ball that sets Kuldeep apart from other wrist-spinners.
The pitch in Dubai is set to slow down further and assist spin as the tournament goes on. The team management will hope that Kuldeep continues his good work as India aim to clinch back-to-back major ICC titles.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Mudassar Nazar fears Pakistan cricket going the hockey way
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-mudassar-nazar-fear-pakistan-cricket-goes-hockey-way-9858092/
Content:
Having moved to England in 1976, Mudassar Nazar may not have spent a lot of time in Pakistan. But few knew Pakistan and its cricket as well as Nazar.
These days, the former all-rounder lives in Dubai but still breathes cricket. So when the 68-year-old says he genuinely fears Pakistan’s cricket team going down the same downward spiral route as its decorated hockey side, one sits up and listens.
Speaking at the ICC Academy here, Mudassar doesn’t waste time getting to what’s bothering him most about Pakistan and its cricket. Towards the end of the 1970s, he had seen what live cricket coverage could do for Pakistan’s national sport hockey. With the team failing to make the podium at Moscow Olympics, over-the-top criticism would soon become the norm with several former players eyeing jobs in the hockey federation. These days, one could get to see similar content on YouTube channels of former Pakistan players and on panel shows.
“In the late 70s, hockey was very popular. The live telecast of India- Pakistan cricket just hit the roof. And it just about coincided with the time when our hockey team was just struggling a bit. On TV, senior hockey players would pick our own players apart. Every other day, they were fighting for positions in the system and it started to have an effect on the game. Look where our hockey is now,” Mudassar tells The Indian Express.
On Naseem Shah
He's never had a real long run. After a maximum of 6-7 months, he's back on the rehab table. So, he hasn't developed. With every injury, there comes self-doubt. He is now worried about his shoulder. He should go back and play First-Class cricket. Only then he can gain confidence.
On Shaheen Shah Afridi
With his height and the angle he delivers from, he was always going to be a threat. But he was hurried back after an injury, and hasn’t been the same. If he wants to bowl 10 overs in one-day cricket, he must bowl 20-22 overs in a day in First- Class cricket to be able to do that. Like Zaheer Khan, he should go to county cricket and work on his game, because Shaheen has a problem with his wrist.
Haris Rauf
Rauf doesn't want to play First-Class cricket, only T20s. But even if you want to bowl four overs, you must be able to bowl 10-12 overs in First-Class cricket a day. He is one-dimensional and bowls only incoming deliveries. Batsmen can easily clear their front leg and hit him over mid-wicket. So the yorker – a delivery with a low margin of error, becomes your wicket-taking ball. But it often ends up as a half-volley.
“It could happen in cricket as well. All the former players are looking for jobs. It’s painful to watch people pick on players and not talk about the game. The only saving grace is the money coming from the ICC. But things need to be turned around now.”
His father Nazar Mohammad faced Pakistan’s first ball in Test cricket and was also their first Test centurion.
After his playing career, Mudassar has served as coach, and head of the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Lahore – responsible for spotting talents and nurturing them into world-class players. In 2003, after a horrendous World Cup campaign, it was the talents identified by Nazar who formed the core of the transition phase.
“India is formidable because it has all bases covered. The IPL has brought money which the BCCI has invested back into the game. When we built the NCA, it was a state-of-the-art facility which even impressed the Indian players when they came here in 2004. But now, others have moved ahead. Once I moved out, they shut it down,” Nazar says.
The IPL has brought about a systemic change in India’s cricket with more emphasis on fitness and hiring professional coaches but, Mudassar says, the same hasn’t happened despite eight seasons of the Pakistan Super League.
“The PSL isn’t settled yet. There are always issues between the cricket board and the PSL franchises. Except for Lahore Qalandars, none of them are investing in grassroots. We have never been the best fielding side or the fittest, but now we are far behind the rest.”
A very stodgy batsman during his playing days, Mudassar is worried about where Babar Azam’s career is heading. “He is not out of form. He comes out and hits four-five boundaries and even batted 30 overs against New Zealand. During a tour in the 1980s, I saw Greg Chappell struggle to put bat to ball… that was being out of form,” he said.
“Babar, on the other hand, is mentally scarred ever since he was removed from captaincy. He needs to take a break for three-four months like Kohli. Then come back, play First-Class cricket, score three-four centuries. That way, we will get 7-8 years of cricket from him.”
With noises getting louder for a complete overhaul of the team, with a new coach and captain, Mudassar believes this isn’t the time to press the reset button.
“If you keep changing, you are going to struggle. If you have 3-4 past captains in a team, it is not a good sign. You have Aaqib Javed as coach, so give him continuity. Whether it is foreign coaches or local coaches, stability is important. You need to have a three-five year plan. The actual change that is needed is that the government shouldn’t appoint the board chairman. If the Prime Minister changes, the PCB chairman also changes. That leads to more changes. It’s a vicious cycle.”
Mudassar was interested to know what Sunil Gavaskar thought of Pakistan’s batting, especially Babar, before going on a nostalgic ride.
“For me, he is the god of batting. Nobody knows batting better than him. He is my favourite and because of that, my teammates would ask me to sledge him. But he would never respond. Who else could have scored that 96 at Bangalore (in 1987)? I still believe he got a wrong decision in the end,” he adds.

Title: Fakhar Zaman dismisses rumours that he’s planning to retire after injury-enforced end to Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/fakhar-zaman-retirement-rumours-injury-champions-trophy-pakistan-9858017/
Content:
Pakistan team talisman Fakhar Zaman has dismissed rumours that he was on the verge of retiring. Zaman, in fact, told the Pakistan Cricket Board’s social media team in an interview published on the PCB’s X handle that he wants to continue playing all forms of cricket.
Zaman, who is currently injured, said that he should be fit for national duty in a month’s time.
Zaman has been ruled out of the ongoing Champions Trophy that Pakistan is hosting after he got hurt during Pakistan’s opener against New Zealand in Karachi.
“Well, I’ve also heard a lot about this and my friends have also sent messages. There is no truth in this. One-day is my favourite format and, yes, because of my thyroid (problem) I was thinking of taking some time off from cricket. But retirement never crossed my mind. I want to play One-day, T20, even I want to play Test cricket,” Zaman said in a video posted on ‘X’ by Pakistan Cricket Board.

In the game against New Zealand, he had suffered a muscle strain while fielding in the New Zealand innings and spent most of the time off the field. He then batted at No 4 instead of opening the innings while Pakistan chased a 320-run target. Instead of him, Saud Shakeel opened the innings. At No.4, Zaman scored 24 off 41, as Pakistan lost by 60 runs.
“Had I opened then things could have been different because when you get a big target, then the opener has a big role to play,” Zaman said.
Pakistan had to call on Imam-ul-Haq to replace Zaman in the side for the Champions Trophy. Pakistan lost to India in the second game and are out of the tournament.
The 34-year-old top-order batter has played 86 ODIs and averages a just over 46. He believes that he will be back playing in a month.
“A far as my comeback (from injury) is concerned, I will hopefully return to competitive cricket in a month. I got an idea (about my Champions Trophy campaign ending) after the pain I felt,” he said.
“In the last one week, I’ve seen a marked improvement in my healing. The doctor has said that I can start training after three weeks, so I should be back in one month,” Zaman said. “I still want to play Tests but but the coaches and captain have their own planning and I also feel that there are better Test players in Pakistan,” he said, adding, “I would like to open on comeback but it’s up to them where they want to keep me.”

Title: Ranji Trophy final: How clever Vidarbha outwitted defensive-minded Kerala on the opening day
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-how-vidarbha-outwitted-kerala-on-opening-day-9857960/
Content:
Three batting specialists of Vidarbha were knocking the ball in the dry, bald patch outside the dugout when captain Akshay Wadkar breezed past them after the toss, ignored them all and gestured to spinner Parth Rekhade, shadow bowling beside the sightscreen, to pad up. Slightly bemused, even though he had batted at No 3 in the first innings against Mumbai, Rekhade blitzed up the stairs. Nearly 25 minutes later, he strode out with Dhruv Shorey to face the first ball of the game. He lasted merely two balls, leg before the wicket to a late-swinging pearler from MD Nidheesh on review. But it was the first sign that Vidarbha would outwit Kerala on the first day of the Ranji Trophy final.
When the makeshift opener retreated, the decoy one-drop walked in. Darshan Nalkande usually bats at No 8, but to nullify the moisture-induced movement, Vidarbha were ready to sacrifice a lower-order batsman.“We thought if they could face a few deliveries and take the shine off the ball, it would be good for the top-order batsmen. There was a bit of movement in the morning, and we thought why should we expose the top-order to the new ball? One good ball and you are gone,” explains Danish Malewar, on whose 138 not out and 215-run stand the hosts propelled to 258 for 4, from 24 for 3.
Run-wise, reversing roles made little difference. Nalkande survived longer—21 balls—than Rekhade and perished as delusional lower-order hand would. He tried to pull a climbing short ball from outside the off-stump and holed out to the lone man on the leg side. But more than the deliveries or time the pair consumed, the move froze Kerala – playing the Ranji final for the first time – into already ruing that they had wasted a toss, that they had shot themselves on the foot.
Inverting the batting pyramid is not a fresh strategy, even if rarely used. Sir Don Bradman, on a dangerously wet pitch in Melbourne (1937), opened with Bill O’Reilly and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith (“Smith going in at No 10 was an adventure,” Neville Cardus wrote). When the pitch’s djinns exorcised—even if the openers survived only eight balls — Bradman came out at No 7, and piled 270 runs. The strip here was not as deceitful as the Melbourne graveyard—“Never before” Cardus wrote, “have I seen a wicket so spiteful or eccentric”—but it deflated Kerala’s spirits as the day wore on.

With every wicketless ball, every run scored, every four flayed, the toss faux pas could have come to haunt them. It challenged the unwritten Jamtha code, where teams unhesitantly bat first after winning the toss, compile a monstrous total and twinkle out the opponents in the fourth innings, when the pitch inevitably reveals its vile traits. In all the seven Tests at this venue, teams have batted first after winning the toss, even though some of them have ended up losing. Kerala’s logic, outrightly defensive and betraying their insecurities, could have been two-fold. A) Exploit the first-hour moisture. B) Batting second, they would know the exact target to chase so that they could bat accordingly. Both planes of thought were flawed.
The moisture on the sun-soaked ground would rapidly evaporate. An hour into the first session, the surface started playing true to its inherent nature. Two balls that kept low aside, nothing untoward occurred. On the slower side, but not slow enough to make batting laboured, stroke-making was straightforward for batsmen at this level. The seamers bargained little movement, spinners heckled negligible turn. Moreover, Kerala don’t possess condition-proof bowlers. The medium pacers swing and seam on green tops, spinners turn it square on drier surfaces. This deck offered neither, but a load of labour under the harsh afternoon sun.
Worse, they sacrificed a top-order batsman for a seam bowler, thus weakening their batting. Except for the unshaved, uneven smattering of grass, there was little instigation to bowl first. No dark clouds hovering, no forecast of rain, no discernible vulnerabilities among Vidarbha’s batsmen when batting first. And potentially a fourth innings ordeal looms. It merely exposed their naivety, stemming perhaps from cluttered thinking.
Not that they didn’t persevere. Nidheesh pounded the ball with all his heart, wits and muscle, only for the ball to lose all energy after landing, whereupon it drawled to batsmen. Malewar and Karun Nair batted without much ado. Unless they plotted their own dismissals, they could bat deep into the day. So they did, with a double-hundred partnership, their second of the season. Malewar donned the lead act, while Karun contently sang the backing vocals.
A run out, the only avenue a wicket seemed like falling, ended the stand. That was the only moment of madness Vidarbha endured, and Karun threw his bat in a fit of rage. He looked destined for another hundred, before he defied the sacred truism: never run off a misfield. “He was gutted, he was batting so well,” Malewar admits.
The run out did lift Kerala’s flagging morale at the fag end of the day. But to contain Vidarbha from hurtling into a monstrous total looks intimidating, what with their highest run-getter, Yash Rathod, Wadkar and utilitarian lower-order hands ready to cash in on a flaccid deck bleeding runs. But as much as the supple frame of Malewar, the faces of the two-night watchmen, Rekhade and Nalkande, would haunt them this night.
Brief scores: Vidarbha 254/4 (Danish Malewar 138*, Karun Nair 86, MD Nidheesh 2/33)

Title: Remember the name: Danish Malewar hits hundred in Ranji final to power Vidarbha
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/danish-malewar-hundred-ranji-final-vidarbha-kerala-9857939/
Content:
Upon completing his three-figure mark, Danish Malewar dropped his helmet and bat on the ground, raised his hands, gazed at the skies with eyes shut, put his index finger into his ears and bowed down. “It’s how I always celebrate, like my idol KL Rahul, just to show that I am at peace, that the outside noise doesn’t affect me,” he says, with a bashful smile. None begrudged a rare show of blustery youth, for he had batted with preternatural poise to script his second hundred, an unbeaten 138 (259 balls), of his maiden first-class season and put Vidarbha on the saddle of the Ranji Trophy final (258 for 4 ).
Malewar is only 21. But he could pass off as a high schoolboy; the stubble is thin and patchy, his voice is faint and quivery, and drowned in the chatter of his colleagues playing football on the edge of the fence. But with the bat in his hand, he is articulate and time-travels into a mature, battle-hardened batsman, whose stroke-play blazed as much as his maturity. There are no peculiar quirks about his batting; the movements are precise and decisive, the switch of weight to either feet is seamless, the judgment of length on a surface where the ball occasionally kept low, was immaculate.  He possesses so much time that he concedes an impression that he could be late into his strokes, yet he finds himself at the right place at the right time. Ask him about this gift and he says, demurring. “Don’t know how it happens, but maybe due to practice.”
Off-side preference was evident. The movement Kerala’s seamers sought fuller lengths in pursuit of lateral movement, which manifested intermittently, he just stretched forth and punched them through the line, his high front elbow winking at the blue, spotless skies. He was hardly beaten on the drive because he rarely attempted to drive anything un-drivable. No throwing of hands at the ball, no over-exuberant slashes at wide balls. He left the balls in the corridor adroitly, as though he had drawn an imaginary line that he didn’t breach. At the start of the innings, he once stabbed at the ball, the edge flew past gully to gift his first four, but thereafter, he desisted such unwieldy urges. “I have been a bit reckless in some of my earlier knocks, when I failed to convert my half-centuries (5) into centuries. So I was determined to get one, and no better time than a final,” he says.
Yet, he purred along at a healthy run-rate because he assured the loose balls raced to the ropes. The persevering Eden Apple Tom was driven languidly through mid off—nothing but a front-foot stretch and the hands descending in a fluid straight swing to reroute the ball past the bowler. A more audacious stroke was the punch off the back-foot. He goes fully back, unlike several modern-day batsmen who go half backwards and rely on their hand-eye coordination to manufacture the impetus. But he is rooted to the conventions, goes back, stands tall, rises with the ball, gets on top of it and coaxes it through covers. MD Nidheesh, the most penetrative of Kerala’s bowlers could only stand and admire an on-the-rise punch off his bowling. So stood N Basil, when he was flicked from outside the off-stump through mid-wicket with a wristy flourish, an ode to the virtuosos of Hyderabad, VVS Laxman and Mohammad Azharuddin.
To contain his off-side flourish, the reactive bowlers veered into his body, whereupon those silken wrists swirled them ball through unusual paths. Post lunch, he fed on the middle-stump savouries, rolling his wrists over them to the fence. He would celebrate his hundred with one such stroke, two balls after he had thumped Aditya Sarwate over his head to race from 93 to 99 in one calculated swipe. It’s the stroke that first came to his mind when asked about his best shot of the day.
“That was my favourite shot,” he says, before he has a rethink and ends up picking out every stroke of his, like a toddler flaunting all his toys in one gasp. “Woh flick mara na, back to back, woh bhi acha laga. Aur woh pull, aur wo back foot punch, aur…” He could not stop gushing about his strokes.
Short-ball intrusions were promptly nipped as he pulled and cut with unfussy finesse. He pulled the nippy Eden, and glanced Basil off his hips. He later tucked into the left-arm spin of Aditya Sarwate, carving him for a pair of sixes either side of the sight-screen, before late-cutting him when went shorter. Kerala SOS-ed their miracle man, Jalaj Saxena, only to be crisply swept. Captain Sachin Baby shuffled his seamers, set unconventional fields, tried to strangle him, bait him with intemperate shot-making But Malewar remained unshakeable and unshackled to walk back to the dressing room with rippling applause from his teammates and the motley local crowd.  “I cannot believe that I have scored a hundred. In a Ranji final. No doubt, the best day of my life,” he says. A day that unfolded like a dream.
A day that he only dreamt when picking a bat for the first time at the age of seven, when his father enrolled him at the academy despite his meagre income as a saving’s collection agent for a local bank, hopping from one house to another all year round. “He sacrificed all his life so that I can make a life. They have sacrificed a lot for me, and I have to make them proud every time I go to bat,” he says. He certainly has made them proud on Wednesday with a hundred of style, silk and significance.

Title: Why Virat Kohli is a great ODI chase master
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/is-virat-kohli-the-most-odi-coded-batsman-ever-9857856/
Content:
Near the end of his career, watching Sachin Tendulkar bat was like watching a rerun of one’s favourite show. India’s first big television cricket star had somehow incredibly managed to erase all signs of risk from his game, and his rhythms were all seamlessly patted down to a re-run pattern, a feeling of comfortable familiarity. His reactions to the ball, his shots, his body tics, his pacing of an innings – everything was synchronised to a wondrous predictability, and that’s a tribute.
These days, if any Indian batsman can do it, it’s Virat Kohli. If there was one Indian who could even make a hundred against Pakistan look “boring” as he did on Sunday night, it was Kohli. It’s quite something really. One could sense that extra burst of adrenaline in all others in that line-up, including his contemporary Rohit Sharma; but not Kohli. He exudes a feeling of anachronism in one-day cricket – and that’s a tribute.
The one difference was that since his recovery from a fallow period in 2007, Tendulkar had enough years for one to soak up that fuzzy re-run feeling. Kohli’s immediate past, with a long shallow period primarily in Tests, has led to an artificial feeling of fretfulness about his game in general – and luckily Sunday evening helped peel off that layer and gawk at his champion ODI game.
Not many are intimate with this format’s soul as him; its ebbs and flows, its hinge-moments that turn a game, the demands of the middle-overs that lures a certain street-smart persona like him who knows how to flow along, to tick along without any unnecessary dopamine-fuelled detours. Kohli knows when to impose himself, when to retreat into the shadows.
There was a moment there in the Pakistan game that made one wonder how Test batsman Kohli would have reacted. The impetuous spinner Abrar Ahmed had stopped a Kohli punch off his own bowling, and threw the ball toward the head of Kohli, who ducked and let the ball sail through to its intended destination of Muhammad Rizwan’s wicketkeeping gloves. The Test Kohli might have glared or stirred himself up; the ODI Kohli just shrugged it off by playing an imaginary defensive shot. Abrar had taken a step forward, looking for a stare or any reaction, but Kohli had punctured him with his non-reaction.
Of course, a known protagonist with whom he has a past might have stirred something in him. But in general, the ODIs almost calm down Kohli – sort of. Perhaps, there are no self-doubts, no apprehensions about success, no urge to work his aggressive persona. The ODI middle-overs are his serene home after all, especially during a chase.
If there is still an area – not of concern necessarily – but a phase to watch him closely it’s against the new ball in Powerplay. And this is probably because of the fresh memories of his Test struggles. When the ball is hurled outside off, we peer into his movements – of the body and of the mind. He was extremely assured against Pakistan, cracking a couple of cover drives that were instagrammed to perfection, but one wonders if that feeling will last till the end of this tournament against better teams like New Zealand and South Africa, Australia who are bound to attack with more purpose and cricketing intelligence than the Pakistanis.
The Powerplay is the only period where Kohli makes us feel that he is extending himself – a chasing cover drive, a fetching swat-flick, and the odd sashays down the pitch. The same shots deployed during the middle-overs come across as reactions to demands of the ball; there is something akin to a feeling of risk against the new ball.
“It is a catch 22 [situation]. It has been my kind of weakness as well over the years but I have scored a lot of runs off that shot,” Kohli said on BCCI.Tv. “I think today was just about backing my shots. I think the first couple of boundaries I got were cover drives on the rise so I really had to let it go a little bit, take a risk and follow through with my shots.”
For the rest of the game, he can almost set himself on auto-pilot – that feeling of re-run. “One thing that I always thought of batting at no.3 is minimise the risk and make sure I put my team in a winning position. If you have a chance to finish off the game in a run chase, then it is much better. I always prefer that kind of a situation. My role over the years has remained the same. Whatever the demands of the game, I put my head down and do that.”
No one does that minimising risk better than him. No one, resultantly, has had such success in ODIs as him. No one else can make Ricky Ponting’s statement about Kohli being the best ODI batsman he has ever watched seem like a statement of fact. Else, such comments usually bring out murmurs from former players about how different eras can’t be compared and all that piffle. No such out-of-tune critical note escapes from anyone about Kohli and his place in ODI history.
No one else has made ODI batting – even in the context of the modern-day version where T20 batting has had an undeniable effect in the nature of batting – feel like a rerun. To make it look ‘boring’ almost –  and that’s the greatest accomplishment of Virat Kohli the ODI batsman.

Ibrahim Zadran blasted a 146-ball 177 against England in a Group B encounter in the Champions Trophy on Wednesday. Zadran broke a clutch of records with this innings. Zadran set the record for the highest score in a ICC Champions Trophy game before he was dismissed by Liam Livingstone. By then, Zadran had slammed 12 boundaries and six hits over the fence. England now need 326 runs to win and stay alive in the Champions Trophy.
Zadran set a glut of records at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday. He is the only Afghan batter to score centuries in both the ICC Cricket World Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy. The 177-run knock is now the highest ever ODI score for an Afghan batter. The 23-year-old became the youngest player to score over 150 runs in an ICC tournament. He also registered the highest score against England in an ICC tournament.

Title: Australia’s Matthew Kuhnemann cleared of suspected illegal bowling action
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-matthew-kuhnemann-cleared-suspected-illegal-bowling-action-9857538/
Content:
Australian spinner Matthew Kuhnemann can continue bowling in international cricket after his action was declared legal by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Kuhnemann had been reported by match officials for a suspected illegal bowling action during Australia’s 2-0 Test series win over Sri Lanka this month where he ended up taking 16 wickets. Following this, he underwent an assessment at the National Cricket Centre in Brisbane.
The all-clear from ICC means that Kuhnemann can resume playing for Australia in the Test tour of the Caribbean scheduled later this year.
A report in Reuters said that the ICC stated on Wednesday the amount of elbow extension for all of Kuhnemann’s deliveries was found to be within the level of tolerance permitted under the ICC Illegal Bowling Regulations. A bowler is allowed 15 degrees of extension in their elbow before a delivery is considered illegal.
Cricket Australia (CA) said Kuhnemann is now free to continue playing international cricket. Ben Oliver, CA executive general manager national teams, said: “We are pleased for Matt that this matter is now resolved. It has been a challenging period for Matt however he has carried himself exceptionally well. He has had the full support of Australian cricket and he can now move forward to the next phase of his international career with great confidence.”
Kuhnemann’s case had generated debate in Australia because of the 28-year-old’s previously spotless record in more than 100 professional matches dating back to 2017, including five Tests and four one-day internationals. The spinner made his Test debut for Australia in 2023, and has claimed 25 wickets to his name so far from five matches.

Pitch report at Rawalpindi’s Cricket Stadium for PAK vs BAN
The pitch at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium is expected to be on the slower side given the muggy climate with the seamers receiving assistance. IF the past is any indication, pacers might receive some early assistance. But as the game progresses, the surface is likely to favour batters. Spinners could find some grip on the surface when it starts deteriorating.
Weather update for Rawalpindi for PAK vs BAN
The weather forecast for Rawalpindi for Thursday predicts a cloudy with occasional showers in the afternoon. Temperatures are likely to hover in the low 20s, with precipitation chances shooting up to nearly 88 percent.

Title: Champions Trophy: Rawalpindi pitch invader who hugged New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra arrested and banned from all cricket venues
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-rawalpindi-pitch-invader-ban-rachin-ravindra-nz-vs-ban-9857264/
Content:
The Rawalpindi pitch invader who caused a major security breach during New Zealand’s Group A Champions Trophy clash against Bangladesh on Monday has been apprehended and barred from all cricket venues, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed.
The invader who was allegedly carrying a photo of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader, Saad Rizvi, was presented in court after he evaded the security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground to approach and hug New Zealand batter Rachin Ravindra in the middle during the match.
The incident had put the PCB under immense pressure given that Pakistan were hosting their first major ICC tournament in 29 years since the 1996 World Cup.
“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement.
“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement read.
Returning to action after he recovered from a severe face injury that he suffered while fielding during the recent Tri-Series in Pakistan, Ravindra was visibly disturbed after the intruder’s entry. “To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” the PCB said.
Despite the incident, Ravindra cruised to his maiden Champions Trophy century to set up the Kiwis’ victory that booked their place in the semi-finals. New Zealand will next face India in their last group-stage match on Sunday.

Title: Who is Danish Malewar, 21-year-old Vidarbha batter who hit century in Ranji Trophy Final against Kerala?

Content:
Vidarbha batter Danish Malewar set up the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 final on Wednesday, smashing a 168-ball century on the opening day after his side were put into bat by Kerala at the VCA Stadium, Jamtha in Nagpur.
The stylish right-hander helped Vidarbha overcome a massive scare on a greenish pitch that aided the seamers first up in the first session. Tweaking the batting order slightly, Akshay Wadkar’s men sent lower-order bats Parth Rekhade and Darshan Nalkande up the order to see off the new ball. The plan backfired as Kerala pacers struck thrice within 12 overs, leaving the hosts 24 for three.
Walking in at number four, Malewar and No. 5 Karun Nair then forged a crucial stand as the pair led Vidarbha to lunch. Carrying on their 100-plus partnership after the break, Malewar coasted to his second century of the ongoing season, his maiden campaign for last year’s runner-ups. After moving up to 99 with a six off left-arm spinner Aditya Sarvate, Malewar brought up the milestone with a four off the same bowler through mid-wicket.
💯 for Danish Malewar 👏

The youngster made his First-Class debut in the first half of the Ranji season against Andhra in Nagpur and immediately impressed with a second-innings 61 batting at number three. He followed up with scores of 56, 42 and 59 in his next three innings before recording his maiden First Class hundred (115) against Gujarat at home in Nagpur.
Yet to make his debut in the shorter formats, the 21-year-old Malewar was in his element ever since the Ranji knockout stages began earlier this month. After scoring 75 and a duck against Tamil Nadu in the quarterfinal, Malewar offered valuable contributions in the semi-final against Mumbai (79 and 29) before finding his zone yet again versus Kerala in the final.

Malewar’s father Vishnu, a cricket fan, had decided when he got married that if he had a son, he would make him a cricketer. But being from a lower-middle-class background, Vishnu knew it would be tough.
“My father always wanted me to be a cricketer and I got into an academy when I was seven,. He faced a lot of difficulties but ensured that my cricketing needs were taken care of. There were people who used to give me bats, pads and gloves when I made runs during my junior days. Money only started coming in post my under- 19 days,” Malewar told during the semis.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Karun Nair completes 8000 First-Class runs during Vidarbha vs Kerala final

Vidarbha batter Karun Nair completed a massive milestone as he went past 8,000 First-Class during the Ranji Trophy final against Kerala at the VCA Stadium, Jamtha in Nagpur on Wednesday.
Featuring in his 114th First-Class match, Nair crossed the feat when he reached 10 runs after Vidarbha were asked to bat first by Sachin Baby’s Kerala. Opting for a shuffle in the batting order, Nair walked in at number five in the 13th over after Kerala reduced the hosts to 24 for three.
The 33-year-old Nair who returned to the spotlight after a whirlwind Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign last month, finishing with 752 runs and five hundreds in seven innings, was also among the runs in the second phase of the Ranji Trophy. Nair smashed a hundred in Vidarbha’s last league game against Hyderabad and backed it up with his 22nd First Class century in the quarterfinal victory over Tamil Nadu.
The former Karnataka batter is third among Vidarbha’s top run-getters this season, having gone past 650 runs in 15 innings with three centuries and a half-century.
The ongoing Ranji final is the fourth of Nair’s career since making two appearances for Karnataka between 2013-15 and for Vidarbha when they finished runners-up last year behind Mumbai. Nair played the final in his maiden First-Class season in 2013-14 as Karnataka beat Maharashtra to claim the title. In the following season, Nair emerged as the Player of the Match in the summit clash as he cracked a marathon 328 against Tamil Nadu as Karnataka defended their title.
While over 3700 runs of Nair’s career has come for Karnataka, his brief India Test career between 2016-17 also saw him become the second Test triple-centurion of the country behind Virender Sehwag, cracking an unbeaten 303 against England in Chennai.

ICC Champions Trophy Points Table 2025: For the second day in a row, another Champions Trophy match was called with the Australia vs Afghanistan Group B encounter in Lahore abandoned due to rain. Afghanistan now have 3 points and will have to hope that England defeat South Africa by more than 200 runs while Australia became the third team to qualify for the semifinals after India and new Zealand.
On Thursday, the game between Pakistan and Bangladesh was abandoned due to rain in Rawalpindi. This means both teams will end their campaign with one point each. Afghanistan have eliminated England from the semi-final race at the Champions Trophy with a eight-run victory on Wednesday. This means that Afghanistan, who have two points, are still in the race from Group B for qualification for semi-finals along with Australia and South Africa, both of whom have three points. Elsewhere in group A, the two semi-finalists have been confirmed after India and New Zealand got off to winning starts in their respective Group A campaigns.
While the Black Caps overcame hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh in their first two games, India took the reverse route successfully. While the Men in Blue beat Bangladesh by six wickets wickets, Rohit Sharma’s side deflated Pakistan by six wickets four three days later in Dubai. The four results have eliminated both Pakistan and Bangladesh from the competition while things have spiced up in Group B.

England and Afghanistan face off in a game that’s a virtual knockout. But the winning team today, is not guaranteed a spot in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy either.
Both England and Afghanistan have zero points to their tally after defeats in their first games. Meanwhile, South Africa and Australia are on top of the Group B with three points each, after the no result on Tuesday due to rainfall in Rawalpindi. That no result meant that both teams took home one point each.
The weather forecast for Lahore for the England vs Afghanistan game indicates a clear day as there is no prediction for rain. The temperature will be in the 20s throughout the game.
England vs Afghanistan pitch report for Gaddafi Stadium at Lahore
The Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore is generally known for its pitch that favours batsmen. Dew can be a significant factor, particularly in the second innings. This can make it harder for bowlers to grip the ball, further favouring the batting side. Because of this, teams winning the toss may choose to chase.
Afghanistan: Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah, Ikram Alikhil, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Nangyal Kharoti, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Farid Malik, Naveed Zadran. Reserves: Darwish Rasooli, Bilal Sami.
England: Jos Buttler (c), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Tom Banton, Harry Brook, Rehan Ahmed, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Jamie Smith, Liam Livingstone, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Saqib Mahmood, Phil Salt, Mark Wood.

After the Australia and South Africa match was abandoned on Tuesday, the stakes of Afghanistan and England match just got higher with the loser to become the third team to be eliminated from the Champions Trophy after Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Both England and Afghanistan need to win their remaining two matches in order to stay alive in the tournament so Wednesday’s match between the two sides will see one of their dreams turn to dust. With the pressure mounting, Jos Buttler’s outfit and Hashmatullah Shahidi-led team will look to gain the advantage in Lahore.
With there zero room for error in this match, Afghanistan is expected to turn to the experience of Mujeeb-ur-Rahman in their playing XI against England. Ahmad wasn’t particularly impressive against South Africa in the opener taking just 1 wicket for 65 runs in 9 overs which might cost him his place in the side due to the match being do or die.
England who couldn’t defend 351 runs against Australia were rattled once again in the aftermath when they lost pacer Brydon Carse due to injury. So it’s likely that the Three Lions will plug the gap with Jamie Overton who also has decent batting ability which will keep him a bit ahead of the competition in Gus Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood.
England: Phil Salt, Ben Duckett, Jamie Smith(wk), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler(wk), Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood.

Afghanistan: Rahmanullah Gurbaz(wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi(c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Mujeeb-ur-Rahman/Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqui.

Title: Champions Trophy controversy: Why ‘advantage India’ criticism from Pat Cummins and Michael Atherton about Dubai pitches is valid
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-controversy-advantage-india-dubai-criticism-9856260/
Content:
These are still early days of the Champions Trophy, but the prefix ‘neutral venue’ before Dubai for India’s matches is already inviting chuckles. In a tournament hosted by Pakistan, it is India — thanks to the conditions in Dubai — which is feeling more at home, with teams in Group B already sweating at the prospect of playing their semi-finals here on March 4. It’s somewhat akin to suddenly land up in Chennai to play on carefully-curated sluggish tracks that abet Chennai Super Kings. What’s more, here India don’t have any ‘away’ game.
With the match between Australia and South Africa washed out at Rawalpindi on Tuesday, the Group B is now wide open with Wednesday’s fixture between England and Afghanistan at Lahore being a knockout clash. Once that happens, the calculators would be out of the pockets as the winner of that match will have to win the next match to make it to the semi-finals. Out of the two fixtures on Friday (Australia vs Afghanistan) and Saturday (South Africa vs England) one is certain to be a virtual quarterfinals. Adding to the intrigue is until Saturday’s clash is over none of them will know who has to take the flight to Dubai and face India and who will face New Zealand in second semi-finals at Lahore on March 5.
This of course isn’t a complexity that has been suddenly airdropped. When the ICC adopted a hybrid model for the Champions Trophy, there were noises around the unfair advantage India were going to gain by the virtue of playing all their matches in Dubai. While other teams have had to shuttle between at least two of the three venues in Pakistan – Karachi, Rawalpindi and Lahore, whoever was lined up to face India had to take the flight to Dubai and head back again.
More than the logistical challenge, it is the conditions that one has got to witness in Dubai that is again adding more noise with regards to how India, despite playing in a neutral venue, are after all being a home team. And these noises are not without reasons as well as unlike India, which knew what sort of conditions to expect in Dubai, packed their squad with five spinners, where as the remaining seven teams, while factoring the flat decks in Pakistan have had to rely on pacers as well. If the Dubai pitches played similarly as Pakistan’s, then there wouldn’t be any hue and cry, but they have been markedly different.
That India, so far, have looked the best side in the tournament and with conditions aiding them, the favourites tag has already been added as prefix. “What about the advantage India have in playing only in Dubai? Which seems to me to be a hard-to-quantify advantage, but an undeniable advantage,” former England captain Michael Atherton told Nasser Hussain on Sky Sports Podcast.
“They’re playing at just one venue. Therefore, the selection, you know, can focus in on the conditions in Dubai. And obviously, they’ll know where they’re playing their semi-final as and when they get through to that. That seems to me to be an undeniable advantage, but, you know, kind of hard to quantify how big an advantage,” he said.
It is hard to deny that India indeed have an advantage here. So far in the two matches, dew has been non-existent. So despite batting second on conditions that only get slower through the night, India have managed to post comfortable wins. And whosoever travels to Dubai for the semi-finals will have just one day to assess the conditions and rework their strategy that would be totally different to what they have adapted in Pakistan.
In the two matches in Dubai, 241/4 has been the highest total when batting first. Because of the slightly warm conditions in the afternoon, India’s three spinners – Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav – have made the ball to grip and turn. In the middle-overs, a phase where most teams are used to go on the offensive against spinners because there are only four fielders outside the ring, they may have to find batsmen who could manoeuvre through the gaps. Similarly while operating with the ball, the likes of England, Australia and South Africa have preferred operating with X-factor pacers from one end as against making it easy with spinners because of the field restrictions. Over here, they have to move away from that template even if it is just one game.
It is these elements that are already making the likes of Australia and England feel threatened by the conditions before they board the flight to Dubai. South Africa, to an extent, will be no different, but between the three teams, they seem better equipped to face the conditions here. Among the teams in fray, two teams could pose India plenty of challenges here in Dubai.
For instance, New Zealand, which has a well-balanced team like India with a good mix of spinners and seamers, will enjoy the luxury of getting to know the conditions in Dubai before the knockouts begin. Scheduled to play India in the final group game on Sunday, they will then head back to Lahore for the semi-finals. And in case, should the Black Caps return here, it will make for an even contest as because of the number of left-handed batsmen that Kiwis have in their ranks, India may not be able to play their three left-arm spinners and may have to bring in either Washington Sundar or Varun Chakaravarthy.
Similarly, from an India team point of view, they might feel playing Afghanistan here could pose a bigger threat, because with a rounded spin attack and due to their familiarity with the conditions, will definitely push them to their limits. In 2018, Afghanistan had even tied a game against India here.

But it shouldn’t be all doom. These slow, turning conditions haven’t been completely to India’s liking as well. After all, going extreme with those conditions at Ahmedabad is what made them miss out on winning a World Cup on home soil. And six months ago, they were whitewashed by Sri Lanka in similar conditions. So it is not as if India is invincible in these conditions. The question is how prepared the others are to indulge in a slugfest.

Title: Wasim Akram on Mahmudullah: ‘Looks like he’s here on vacation… Na batting ho rahi, na bowling’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wasim-akram-mahmudullah-vacation-na-batting-ho-rahi-na-bowling-9856094/
Content:
Wasim Akram slammed Bangladesh veteran Mahmudullah for his performance against New Zealand in the Champions trophy game on Monday where Bangladesh tasted defeat by five wickets.
Mahmudullah was out for four runs after facing 14 balls in the first innings. He threw away his wicket against Michael Bracewell after going for a big shot and not managing to connect. The ball landed in the hands of Will O’Rourke.
To make matters worse, he also spilled an easy catch of Rachin Ravindra at mid on on 105. He did redeem himself with a run out of Tom Latham, but by then, the matter was already put to bed.
While talking about Bangladesh’s effort in the field, where they were sloppy, Akram said: “Would you call them unlucky?”
Then training his gun on Mahmudullah: “That was a sitter! Mahmudullah lagda hai chhuti de aaya hai (Mahmudullah looks like he has come here on vacation). Na batting ho rahi, na bowling (He’s unable to bat or bowl),” said Akram about the spilled catch.
He added: “This is a learning curve for Bangladesh cricket. They’ve brought guys like Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim who are 39 and 37 years old. Prepare young players for white ball cricket and let these veterans play red ball if they want to do it. White ball cricket is about fearlessness. This is what Bangladesh needs to think about, preparing a team for next year’s T20 World Cup.”
The pace bowling legend heaped praise on youngster Nahid Rana, who managed to get the wicket of Kane Williamson in the fourth over after inducing an edge with his pace.
“I saw Rana bowling for the first time. Look at the ball he bowled to Williamson… look at the pace, the carry, the swing of the delivery. Zabardast! I like the celebration too. Hardly any. Sometimes youngsters go overboard with their celebrations,” said Akram.

Title: Ranji Trophy final: Powered by outsiders Karun Nair’s Vidarbha and Aditya Sarwate’s Kerala vie for domestic title
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-karun-nair-aditya-sarwate-vidarbha-vs-kerala-9855963/
Content:
As Karun Nair fixed his cap, stroked the stubbled chin and smiled into the cameras mounted near the stairway to the dressing room,  Kerala captain Sachin Baby, striding onto the ground, yipped at the reporters queuing up to shoot questions: “Avanod Malayalathil utharam parayan para!” Ask him to give the answers in Malayalam. Karun flashed a hearty smile and retorted: “Seri, aykotte! Roughly translated as “ok, let it be.”
It’s been a dreamy season for Karun’s Vidarbha, and Baby’s Kerala. Now the two teams will be vying for the Ranji Trophy. There is a bit of history; in 2017-18, Vidarbha had steamrollered Kerala in the quarterfinals enroute to their first championship title. Around 20-25 journalists from Kerala are at Nagpur, sniffing a chance to report history.
For the next half an hour after, Karun patiently answered their questions, often indulging in one-on-one sessions, forced to hear the same questions about his ties with Kerala and give similar answers. Like, “how often do you visit Kerala? What’s your favourite cuisine? Do you speak Malayalam at home? Will you play for Kerala if offered a chance? But he showed no displeasure, even if he could not resist giggling at times, and spoke sparkling Malayalam for someone raised in Bengaluru.
Later, relieved that someone is asking him questions in English, he says: “I don’t think I have given so many interviews in Malayalam in my entire life.” Here, the Malayalam vernacular media that had turned up in droves was trying to dust up his Malayali roots, which his surname makes ubiquitous.
A few yards away, a different reunion was playing out. The moment some Vidarbha Cricket Association office bearers spotted Aditya Sarwate, who moved to Kerala at the start of this season, they rushed and hugged him. Some of his ex-teammates huddled around him, raved about his new tattoo on his forearms and invited him home. Sarwate would tell this daily: “My phone has not stopped ringing ever since I landed here. They want to meet me, have dinner or lunch and things like that. After all, we had been teammates all these years, won and lost together.”
He walked away from the crowd and glanced wistfully at the ground that made him. “Obviously, I felt emotional. I am back to the ground where I grew up, made my first steps in the game, and I am very proud of my achievements with… them.” The “them” chokes somewhere in his throat. Until last year, it was “us.” “Kya kare, we have to move on, and my heart is 100 percent with Kerala.”
Sarwate, like Karun, is an outsider in his team. But both have not only revived their careers, but also emerged as indispensable parts of their teams in the trek to the finals. Sarwate conspired Gujarat’s dramatic collapse on the final day in Ahmedabad, besides being the second-highest wicket-taker for his side (30 at 17.50). Karun amassed 642 runs at 45 to continue his domestic renaissance that scaled its crescendo in the Vijay Hazare tournament.
Before the move they were battling mental demons. Karun was without a team for a year, after he was axed from Karnataka the year before. “Those were difficult days. I was uncertain about everything, like whether my career has ended, or if I would ever play competitive cricket. I am not an extrovert, so I can’t really express in words how sad I felt during that time. So when I  got the Vidarbha, I jumped on it and ensured that I wouldn’t make them regret the decision,” says Karun, who had coincidentally scored a match-winning hundred against Vidarbha in a Ranji final.
Similarly, Sarwate was hurt when talks floated within the coaching staff that he was past his sell-by-date after the tragic final against Mumbai last year. Murmurs of his flailing fitness and commitment hurt one of the tireless servants of Vidarbha, one of the protagonists of the back-to-back title-winning seasons.
Even in his supposedly ordinary season, in 2023-24, he has snaffled 40 scalps at 18.87. “I felt hurt, but I thought it is for my own good to come out of my comfort zone and prove that I am still good enough at this level to take wickets. I was extremely motivated to win games for Kerala,” says Sarwate, whose decade-long domestic career has fetched 306 first-class wickets at 19.25 apiece, besides the two hundreds.
The 35-year-old from Nagpur has faced tougher crises in his life. He was in his teens when his father got bed-ridden and whom he used to bathe and feed. It broke their financial robustness, so he ensured that he completed his graduation and acquired a diploma in financial management that he topped. In case cricket failed him, he had something to lean back on.
Both—multiple Ranji winners and one-team horses for much of their career—have seamlessly adjusted to the cultures of their new teams. “They all speak Hindi quite well, and I have known some of them for several years. They have been very warm towards me, which has reflected on my performances,” says Karun.
Not many in the Kerala team speak Hindi, but language barrier has not hindered Sarwate’s bond with his teammates. “Most of them speak English, some Hindi too. Then there is Jalaj bhai, with whom I have made a strong friendship. I can understand a bit of Malayalam here and there too, but not in the slang some of them speak,” he says.

The two outsiders would ensure that the opponents can’t freely talk tactics in their mother tongue (Marathi and Malayalam) either. A local groundsman has one parting message for Sarwate: “Paanche lo!” Take a five-for. He smiles and flicks a thumbs up. A KCA official, after taking a selfie with Karun, mutters that he “god, he should fail in at least this game”.

Title: ‘He is a brilliant player’: Hashim Amla lauds Shubman Gill
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/hashim-amla-lauds-brilliant-shubman-gill-champions-trophy-india-9855874/
Content:
Former South Africa player Hashim Amla lauded Shubman Gill along with Rishabh Pant and Ryan Rickelton as the next best thing in international cricket. Gill has been on fire in the ODI format, having scored a century in the Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh and a brisk 46 against Pakistan.
“For India, you have got Shubham Gill; Rishabh Pant has been around for a while. For South Africa, we have Ryan Rickelton who has done really well off late,” Amla told PTI Videos in an exclusive interaction.
“Every country has about 2-3 cricketers who are going to come through and I think that’s pretty normal, that you see that every five years some youngster poke in the head through international cricket, and possibly be the next best, big thing,” he added.
The South African batting stalwart also termed Gill a brilliant player, saying his start in ODIs has been exceptional.
“He is a brilliant player, the way he started in one-day cricket, he has been exceptional. He has been a huge part of India’s success at top of the order. To have him and Rohit (Sharma) at the top, it’s a very potent and dangerous opening partnership, and then they have got Virat (Kohli) at No 3,” Amla said.
On Wednesday, Gill dethroned Pakistan’s Babar Azam from the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings. In the latest rankings list, Gill has 796 rating points while Babar has 773. India skipper Rohit Sharma is ranked third with 761 points. South Africa’s Henrich Klaasen and New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell at fourth and fifth respectively.

Gill’s dominance in ODIs has been highly praised and he lived up to the expectations in India’s Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh where he scored a a match-winning century (101*). It was also his fourth successive 50+ score, making him one of the most persistent batters.

Title: Ranji Trophy final: Why Vidarbha is not taking Kerala lightly
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-vidarbha-vs-kerala-preview-9855897/
Content:
In the hidden nodes of Sachin Baby’s memory the sullen afternoon in Wayanad six seasons ago lurks. He stiffly denies lingering pieces of the semifinal heartbreak that Vidarbha inflicted on Kerala, watched on by the forested hills. “I have buried the memories of the game a long time ago,” he tells The Indian Express.
But like hard-to-forget tragedies, the game remains vivid in his consciousness, the details emerging organically when he dwells on the final that unfolds from Wednesday at the Jamtha Stadium. Like he says, “This Vidarbha is vastly different from that Vidarbha.” Then he goes on describing the mastery of Umesh Yadav, who blew “stronger than the winds on that day.” Or when he insists on “not committing silly errors,” and draws a parallel with “the run out that ended his second innings.”
The Kerala captain mumbles “misjudgment” twice.
9⃣ matches
8⃣ wins
1⃣ draw (With first innings lead)
Vidarbha have been dominant this season, showcasing top-class cricket 💪
Here’s how they reached their 4⃣th #RanjiTrophy Final 👌👌#RoadToFinal pic.twitter.com/gthX0eq9KQ

For cricketers of a team that has enjoyed sparse success in the game — they have qualified for the knockouts thrice — such moments remain etched in their consciousness. It doesn’t allay the pain because in their historic final they are meeting the same side that had halted their progress in the knockouts before. Vidarbha is Kerala’s knockout kryptonite, so much that Vidarbha can measure their progress through the Kerala knockouts. They smashed them by 412 runs in the quarterfinals before marching to claim the Ranji Trophy for the first time; en route to the title defence, they steamrollered Kerala. Sachin was the captain in both games. “Onnil pizhachal moonu,” he says, a Malayalam idiom that is the English equivalent of third-time lucky, grinning. “We have beaten them in group games after that. So they are not a psychological barrier. But they are a team from which we could take a lot of lessons,” Sachin says.
Therein lies the central narrative of the game too — Kerala trying to giant-kill the original giant-killers. In Vidarbha, they could blink at their own mini reflection. Thinly talented and with threadbare lineage of international cricketers — even though the legendary CK Nayudu was born in Nagpur and turned up for Central Provinces for a decade, just as star-starved Malayalis boasted about Anil Kumble being born in a village in the Kerala-Karnataka border — they were India’s cricketing wilderness. If Kerala’s monsoon spells stymied cricket’s seamless growth, prolonged droughts slackened Vidarbha’s quest. To replicate the Vidarbha model of success, Kerala even hired Chandrakant Pandit as director for two years.
The masterful coach is widely credited for the emergence. He instilled in Vidarbha a stubborn streak, a bit of khadoos from their neighbours Mumbai, a sense of quiet tenacity, acquired from the numerous slips it had slipped in its journey to become a contemporary cricketing powerhouse.
Whereas as they once relied predominantly on the large pool of borrowed cricketers, the import cast is dwindling. The new crop of home-grown players from one of India’s driest regions is inspiring, from Harsh Dubey to Yash Rathod.
A lot of factors over a lengthy span of diligent planning have contributed to their coming of age. But predominant among them, Vidarbha captain Akshay Wadkar, sums up succinctly, is their awareness of limitations: “We are a team with limitations, always been like that, but we have to learn to overcome that. We understand that we need to be aware of our weaknesses better than we know our strengths. We cannot go into the final believing that we could win the match because we have won finals before and they have not.”
Acing pressure situations & winning crunch moments 🧊 💪
Here’s how Kerala made it to their maiden #RanjiTrophy Final 👌👌#RoadToFinal pic.twitter.com/x6qSrr2jZZ
— BCCI Domestic (@BCCIdomestic) February 24, 2025
It could be the guiding principle of Kerala too. They are a team with flaws. The top order has been woozy and the middle order unstable. Apart from Salman Nizar and Mohammed Azharudheen, no one has scored a century in the entire campaign. Conversely, Vidarbha’s Yash Rathod himself reeled off five; Karun Nair stroked three. The hosts could boast of four batsmen who have piled in excess of 500 runs, with Rathod 77 away from 1,000 runs, whereas only Salman and Azharudheen have amassed 500-plus runs for their adversaries. Kerala have been over-reliant on the two spinners — Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarwate — and the seamer MD Nidheesh. Vidarbha have a more equitable distribution of wicket-taking burden, even though left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey has been the standout performer with 66 wickets. Whilst Vidarbha won eight of their nine games outrightly, Kerala mustered only three wins in their heroic scrape to the final.
It is the bleeding obvious that Vidarbha enter the final as the overwhelming favourites, though Wadkar insists the tab is uncomfortable in the true nature of underdog forebears. But if Wadkar and his teammates observe closely, they could see flashes of the spirit they displayed in the year they kissed the Ranji Trophy for the first time.
They have bounced back from the brink, scrambled back on their feet from crushing punches on their face, unearthed unexpected heroes in duress, and they raged against the seemingly irrevocable doom. Wadkar puts Kerala’s strengths in perspective: “Yes, they enjoyed moments of luck, but to reach the final as they had, playing some close matches and all away from home, you have to give them a lot of credit. They are an experienced team, have a good record on this ground (they have never lost a game here), and have some really wonderful cricketers. Winning close games will give you the belief that nothing is impossible. That is dangerous.”
Numerous nearly-moments in the past decade have emboldened Kerala. “There were times we have missed the knockout qualification by a point or two, when we have somehow contrived to lose games from winning position, and some games we just didn’t turn up,” Sachin says.

He didn’t mention the game, but the horrors of the Wayanad game must have flashed through his mind. He would seek closure to those haunting memories. But here again, Vidarbha, Kerala’s knockout kryptonite, is gnashing its teeth at them ready for the kill.

Title: IPL 2025 | ‘I’ll definitely do it, if it comes my way’: Venkatesh Iyer on Kolkata Knight Riders captaincy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/venkatesh-iyer-kolkata-knight-riders-captaincy-ipl-2025-9855818/
Content:
With the Indian Premier League season right around the corner, speculations have been rife about who will lead the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders after they let go of their title-winning skipper Shreyas Iyer. One name that has been brought up frequently is allrounder Venkatesh Iyer, who was not retained by the franchise ahead of the IPL 2025 auctions, but was bought back by them for a whopping Rs 23.75 crore.
Venkatesh when asked about if he would want to lead the franchise gave his answer in affirmative in an interaction with ESPNcricinfo. “Definitely, I’m ready. Again, I’ve always said this: captaincy is just a tag. I believe in leadership. That is a bigger role to play, being a leader, There’s no ambiguity surrounding this. I’ll definitely do it, if it comes my way. There is no reason not to do it,” Iyer said.
“You don’t necessarily need the tag of a captain to be a leader in your dressing room. You need to set examples. You need to be a good role model, both on and off the field, which I am doing right now in Madhya Pradesh. I’m not the captain of the MP team, but my opinions are respected and I really love to be in an atmosphere where every individual — new or experienced, Rs 20 lakh, Rs 20 crore, whatever — you just need to have the freedom to voice your opinion. You just need to have the freedom to give opinions and give suggestions and them to be taken in the right spirit,” he added.
Iyer had joined the Kolkata franchise in 2021 and has scored 1,326 runs in 51 IPL matches for them. He was also an integral part of the squad which won KKR their 3rd IPL title in 2024.

The defending champions will face the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the opening match of the IPL 2025, scheduled to take place in Kolkata’s Eden Gardens on March 22.

Title: Champions Trophy | Pakistan will struggle to beat India B team, says Sunil Gavaskar
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-pakistan-india-b-team-champions-trophy-9855788/
Content:
Sunil Gavaskar had a scathing comment on Pakistan’s recent woes when he said that this Pakistan team would struggle to even beat a second string Indian side. Champions Trophy hosts Pakistan have been in the receiving end of endless criticism ever since they lost to India on Sunday and it got much louder after they were dumped out of the tournament after New Zealand defeated Bangladesh on Monday.
“I think a B team (from India) certainly (can give Pakistan a run for their money). C team, I am not too sure. But a B team will be very, very hard to beat for Pakistan in their current form,” Gavaskar said on ‘Sports Today’.
“I think it’s surprising-this lack of bench strength. Pakistan always had natural talent. Natural in the sense that they may not have always been technically correct, but they had an instinctive understanding of bat and ball. Look at Inzamam-ul-Haq, for example. If you look at his stance, you wouldn’t recommend that to a young batter, but he had great temperament. With that kind of temperament, he made up for any technical shortcomings,” the former India batter added.
Gavaskar also pointed out that despite the Pakistan Super League, the Men in Green have failed to produce match-winners.
“How has India produced so many young stars in white-ball cricket? It’s because of the IPL. Players from there have gone on to play in the Ranji Trophy and eventually for India. That is something Pakistan cricket must analyse. They need to figure out why they no longer have the bench strength they once did.”

Since the 2017 World Cup, Pakistan have struggled in ICC tournaments with their best performance coming in the 2022 T20 World Cup where they reached the final and lost. The team also finished fifth in the last two ODI World Cups and have failed to reach any World Test Championship final.

Gujarat who finished last in the previous two seasons are currently stuck in the last position this season as well while Delhi have slipped to third after their loss to UP. For Delhi, Shafali Verma and Meg Lanning, Jemimah Rodrigues and Annabel Sutherland have shown glimpses of form but haven’t been consistent.
Gujarat, meanwhile. have been reliant on Australian all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner who has been doing all the heavy lifting for the team, having scored 141 runs this season and is the 3rd highest run getter. However, No. 3 D. Hemalatha and South African batter Laura Wolvaardt haven’t really sparked to form which is a big concern for the franchise.

Title: Sana Mir criticizes PAK team after elimination from Champions Trophy: ‘Even if you make MS Dhoni the captain..’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sana-mir-criticism-pakistan-team-champions-trophy-ms-dhoni-9855742/
Content:
Former Pakistan women’s team captain Sana Mir slammed the men’s cricket team which was eliminated from the Champions Trophy on Monday, saying that even Mahendra Singh Dhoni wouldn’t be able to change the fortunes of the team. Pakistan, who lost back to back matches against New Zealand and Bangladesh, were knocked out of the tournament due to Bangladesh failing to defeat the Kiwis on Monday.
“The 15 that have been selected (in Champions Trophy squad), even if you make MS Dhoni or (former Pakistan skipper) Younis Khan captain, nobody can do anything to the team because it has not been selected on the basis of the playing conditions,” said Mir on ‘Game On Hai’ programme.
“I was watching the match when I got a message from a friend that India are 100 for 2 ‘I think it’s over’. So, I said the match was over when the squad was announced,” she added.
Mir, who played more than 300 white ball games for Pakistan, criticized the selection committee for failing to select the team on the basis of conditions.
“Half the tournament we had lost when we announced the 15-member squad, and I am saying this from day one. They (selectors) knew that Pakistan had to play at least one match in Dubai, so how did you bring two part-time spinners. Abrar (Ahmed), who is still new in ODI cricket… in the last five months, they have taken two wickets conceding 165 runs. The selectors removed key players who played in last two series against Australia and South Africa,” Mir said.

“Irfan (Khan) Niazi was a good fielder, showed good power-hitting (in the T20I and ODI series against South Africa)… so, we lost the tournament when we announced the squad,” the 33-year-old added.

England will take on Afghanistan in a must-win game at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday. A defeat here would severely dent both the teams’ dreams of a semifinal berth in the tournament, as South Africa and Australia have already notched up two points.
AFG vs ENG Match LIVE Cricket Score Online: Watch Here
England’s real problem lies in the patchy form of opener Phil Salt and Harry Brook in the middle-order. Salt’s only hundred in the format was in 2022 and since then the Welshman has not really converted his starts, often getting out after a quick 30 or 40. Brook also offers a similar tale. The Yorkshire man looked in prime form during the home ODIs against Australia last year, hammering a hundred and two fifties in a three-match series. Afghanistan’s three-pronged spin attack, consisting of Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad and Mohammad Nabi, has the potential to trouble even the best, and England batters’ recent outings against slow bowlers are not confidence-inspiring either.

The weather forecast for Lahore indicates a clear day as there is no prediction for rain. The temperature will be in the 20s throughout the game.
The Gaddafi Stadium is generally known for its pitch that favors batsmen. Dew can be a significant factor, particularly in the second innings. This can make it harder for bowlers to grip the ball, further favoring the batting side.  Because of this, teams winning the toss may choose to chase.

Title: Pat Cummins: India have got the obvious benefit of playing all games in Dubai
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pat-cummins-india-have-got-the-obvious-benefit-of-playing-all-games-in-dubai-9855333/
Content:
Australia captain Pat Cummins, who’s out of the Champions Trophy as he nurses an injury, has said India have a “huge advantage” to be based in Dubai for the ongoing Champions Trophy while other countries have to travel around Pakistan for their group games in the tournament, while the countries in India’s group have to travel to Dubai too.
All of India’s Champions Trophy games are staged at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, while the other seven teams crisscross Pakistan.
Cummins told Yahoo Australia: “I think it’s good in that the tournament can go on, but obviously it does give them (India) a huge advantage playing on the same ground. They already look very strong and they’ve got that obvious benefit of playing all their games there.”
The hybrid model of the tournament is such that the final will be held in Dubai if India go the distance. This was done after India refused to travel to Pakistan, the original hosts of the event, citing security concerns.
India have won both their games, against Bangladesh and Pakistan, comfortably so far and are through to the semifinal. Their last group match is on Sunday against New Zealand, a team that has played in Pakistan so far and has also won both of its games.
Aussie skipper Cummins gave the Champions Trophy a miss to be at home for the birth of his second child and rest a niggling ankle injury. It has granted him precious time with his family and a chance to work on a return to cricket.
“It’s been nice to be at home with everything going on and the ankle rehab is tracking well, so I will start running and bowling this week,” Cummins reported. “There’s the IPL (next month) and then we’ve got the Test World Championship and a tour to the West Indies, so there’s a lot to look forward to.”

Title: India vs Pakistan is one-sided contest right now: Michael Atherton
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-is-one-sided-contest-right-now-michael-atherton-9855001/
Content:
Former England captain Michael Atherton said that the rivalry between India and Pakistan has now become “one-sided” as the hype didn’t match the expectations. India on Sunday defeated Pakistan by six wickets in their Group A encounter of the ongoing Champions Trophy in Dubai.
“Well, it was completely one-sided,” Michael Atherton said on Sky Sports Podcast.
“It looked very predictable from a long way out. An underpowered Pakistan batting line-up, as it was in that first game, actually, against New Zealand.
“There just seemed to lack a bit of energy and dynamism in the batting.”
Atherton argued that with all the hyper surrounded around the fixture, the cricket didn’t lived up to its billings.
“There’ a bit of an issue for that contest, isn’t it? Because it’s a highly anticipated contest for all kinds of reasons. Partly, you know, just because of the scarcity value. They only play each other in ICC events on neutral territory for obvious reasons,” he said.
“But there’s such hype around that fixture. You kind of want the cricket to live up to that hype as well. If you look at the results in the last 10 years, I think they’ve played each other nine times in ODIs in the last 10 years.
“Pakistan have only won once, and that was in that final in the Champions Trophy at the Oval. So, it’s a one-sided contest right now. But, you know, I looked at the numbers.
“Since the start of 2000, actually, Pakistan have been very competitive in ODIs against India. I think they’ve kind of won 26, lost 30, something like that. But in the last 10 years, in those nine games, it’s pretty much all gone India’s way with one exception.”

Title: Virat Kohli is right at the top of the tree in the ODIs: Nasser Hussain

Content:
Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain has unanimously called Virat Kohli the best ODI cricketer of all time. Against Pakistan on Sunday in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Virat Kohli became the fastest batter and third man to reach 14,000 runs. He powered the chase to finish on 100 not out — hitting the winning boundary — as India beat Pakistan by six wickets with 45 balls remaining.
“Virat Kohli in a run-chase in 50-over cricket, there’s been nobody better in the history of the game, really,” said Michael Atherton on “Sky Sports Podcast”.
“51 century is an unbelievable number.”
India’s Sachin Tendulkar was the previous quickest batter to reach 14,000 ODI runs, taking 350 innings. Tendulkar still tops the overall ODI runs scored with 18,426 in 452 innings. Another retired batting great, Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara, finished his career with 14,234 runs in 380 innings.
“I mean, he’s got 51 and he passed 14,000 runs, which only Tendulkar and Sangakkara have got past that mark in one-day cricket,” said Atherton.
“And he got them in 60-odd innings quicker than Sachin, and I think about 90-odd innings quicker than Kumar. So, I mean, ODI is probably his best. You know, he’s been a great all-format player, clearly, but you’d probably say that ODI is his absolute best format,” he said.
Nasser Hussain also showered praise on Virat Kohli.
“He’s been an incredible player. Yeah, and you’d have to say probably the best player in ODIs of all time, really, with those stats you mentioned,” said Hussain.
“You’d have Tendulkar in the same conversation. Kumar, you’d have AB de Villiers. They’ve been some great ones, but he’s right at the top of the tree.
“If you ask India what did they want yesterday, beat Pakistan and get Kohli back in nick, they’ve got both of those.”

Title: Champions Trophy | Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton on India playing in Dubai: ‘They have an undeniable advantage’

Former England captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton has said that the Rohit Sharma-led India has an “undeniable advantage” of playing all their matches in Dubai.
India are playing all their matches — including the one against Pakistan — at a neutral venue in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
“What about the advantage India have in playing in Dubai, only in Dubai? Which seems to me to be a hard-to-quantify advantage, but an undeniable advantage,” said Michael Atherton in conversation with Naseer Hussain on Sky Sports Podcast.
“They’re playing at just one venue. They don’t have to travel either between venues or, you know, between countries, as a lot of other teams have to do.
“Therefore, the selection, you know, can focus in on the conditions in Dubai. And obviously, they’ll know where they’re playing their semi-final as and when they get through to that. That seems to me to be an undeniable advantage, but, you know, kind of hard to quantify how big an advantage,” he said.
Nasser Hussain said India have been very smart with their selection and the five-spinners in the squad is making sense.
“It is an advantage. So, the best team in the tournament have that advantage. And I saw a tweet the other day saying ‘Pakistan host nation, India home advantage.’ It sums it up really,” he said.
“They are at one place, one hotel, they don’t have to travel. They have one dressing room. They know the pitch, they have picked for that pitch.
“They were very smart in their selection. They probably knew what Dubai is going to be like. They picked all their spinners. there was a bit of debate with Indian media saying why don’t you have gone for an extra seamer? Why all these spinners? Now we can seen why.
“For example the other sides like England if they do get to the semis they have only one spinner (Rehan Ahmed is added as replacement of Brydon Carse), Pakistan have one frontline spinner. You can says that when the injuries came they should have change that and I have made that argument.
“Other teams will have to pick playing XIs for different conditions in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi and then they have to travel and adjust to those conditions.
“So it is an advantage but what else could have happened. Once India refused to come to Pakistan, what could have happen. You can’t have a tournament like this without India-Pakistan. It had to be in Dubai.
“They sit happily and comfortably there. They know they are going to play six games there and if they will win all those, they will win another global tournament,” he said.

Australia take on South Africa in a group B clash at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium a dat after the ground hosted the New Zealand vs Bangladesh game.

In Tuesday’s game, Australia, who are the World Cup champions, are missing as many as seven members of the squad that lifted the World Cup Trophy 15 months ago in India. Skipper Pat Cummins (ankle), pacer Josh Hazlewood (hip) and all-rounder Mitch Marsh (back) were ruled out. Marcus Stoinis retirement suddently earlier this month to leave the Australian selectors scrambling to find replacements. Mitchell Starc also pulled out due to personal reasons.
Here’s a quick guide to what to expect from the Rawalpindi game:
There’s a significant chance of rain, with predictions ranging from 50% to 70% probability. The temperature is expected to hover around 15 degrees Celsius. Temperatures may range from 14 to 24 degrees Celsius. In essence, the weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of rain, which could potentially disrupt the match.
The Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium is generally known for its batting-friendly pitch. Expect to see high scores, as the pitch tends to be flat with good bounce and pace. As the game wears on, the pitch tends to slow down, which can bring spinners into play. Spinners could find good turn and variable bounce. Recent ODI games played at this venue have seen large scores being chased down. Given the batting-friendly nature of the pitch and the potential for dew, the team winning the toss might prefer to field first.
Australia squad: Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Spencer Johnson, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matt Short, Adam Zampa. Travelling reserve: Cooper Connolly

Title: Champions Trophy 2025, AUS vs SA: Heinrich Klaasen to miss out again, Australia set to field unchanged XI

Content:
With Group A’s semifinalists decided, all eyes will now turn to Group B where Australia and South Africa will renew their rivalry in ICC events when the two sides lock horns again in Rawalpindi. Both sides have won one each with Australia defeating England and South Africa edging past Afghanistan.
A win in this match will virtually guarantee a place in the semifinal for either the Aussies or the Proteas. Before the tournament began, both South Africa and Australia came into it with dismal ODI records with the Steve Smith-led side losing their last 4 matches while Temba Bavuma’s team losing 6 out of 6 ODIs. But both have turned that form around with comprehensive wins in their tournament openers.
South Africa’s big hitter Heinrich Klaasen had to miss out their opener against Afghanistan die to an elbow injury. This time around also, the Proteas are expected to line up without him against Australia. But they will not be short of firepower with Ryan Rickelton, who scored a century against Afghanistan, in blistering form. Their other players like Bavuma, Aiden Markram and Rassie van der Dussen had also chipped in with half centuries so expect another blistering performance from the Proteas against a depleted Aussie side.
The Aussies already missing the likes of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Marsh and Josh Hazlewood are short of star power in the squad. So, with Josh Inglis slamming a century against England will give them some relief heading into the South Africa clash. Matthew Short and Alex Carey also put in a shift against England with two half centuries which compensated for he lack of runs from Travis Head and captain Steve Smith. Both star batters might find more joy in the Rawalpindi pitch so it’ll be foolish to write off Australia in an ICC event, however depleted they are.
Australia: Matthew Short, Travis Head, Steve Smith (capt), Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Spencer Johnson

Title: Why Javed Miandad, R Ashwin, Cheteshwar Pujara are impressed with Shubman Gill’s batting
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-shubman-gill-batting-pujara-miandad-ashwin-9854310/
Content:
The wily old Javed Miandad was impressed. It’s a show from a year ago where Miandad asks upcoming cricketers from Pakistan to look and learn from Shubman Gill’s batting. And his wrists in particular. Miandad, whose street-cred is well established in India-Pakistan battles, gestures the wrist-break of Gill: he gestures how Gill powers the ball and gives it direction by snapping his wrists.
On Sunday, another wily customer, the recently-retired R Ashwin, cued up two balls from Shubman Gill to talk about Gill’s hands, feet, and the smart brain. The first ball is when Gill moved down the track to lift Shaheen Afridi’s length delivery up and over the infield to the long-on boundary. Ashwin points to how close Gill’s hands are to his body, and how his feet get ready to move. It’s a shot replayed on YouTube shorts and in highlights packages, but Ashwin is more impressed with what followed. On paper, it’s just a flick for a single, that turns to two due to an overthrow, but it’s interesting to see why Ashwin rates it.
“Look at his hands, the way he brings it from outside off this time (more away from the body this time as opposed to the previous ball), and his feet press back. He anticipates that the fast bowler Shaheen Afridi might bounce him. The way the hands have moved indicate he is ready for the pull (the short-arm characteristic fierce jab), and his feet suggest he is readying to go back. Afridi also realises it and goes fuller,” Ashwin says on his YouTube show ‘Ash ki baat’. But though Gill is ready for the pull, he doesn’t commit. “He adjusts and flicks it away.”
And there is the factor that Pakistani Basit Ali cottoned on to on his YouTube channel after Gill’s hundred against England in the recently concluded ODI series. “Voh ab maazey le raha hai bhaari ke. Phase khelta hai, mein kyun Bongi shot khel k out hoon? Isey kehte hain art of batting, class batting. (He is now enjoying his batting. Wants to get stuck in there in the middle, why should I get out playing reckless shots?”)
Put together Miandad, Ashwin’s observations about his batting, and Basit’s point about the maturing persona, it’s easy to see why Gill the white-ball batsman is the No.1 cricketer in the world in this format. The skill (the wrist-snap that Miandad loves), the head-space that impresses Ashwin, and the desire to play match-deciding knocks and not just games — the three traits have increasingly been blending together harmoniously for a while now.
All those three features gelled beautifully in the moments after the fall of Rohit Sharma. He patted down cautiously the deliveries from Naseem Shah, a bowler who hits the best lengths against him. Not too full like Shaheen can allow Gill, essentially a batsman who stays on and or behind the crease line, to let his hands flow through the drives without a big positive stride. Not back of length like Haris Rauf, that allows Gill to punch on the up and short-arm jab. Naseem’s lengths demanded Gill to press forward if he wanted to drive on the up, else take the risk of punching it aerially, and he quietly tapped them away.
He was up and about in the next over from Shaheen. A peach of a cover drive had the full-length ball plummeting through extra cover. A couple of balls later he went down the pitch to ping the straight boundary before he did what Ashwin was impressed with – a quiet flick shot.
It’s his intent that he says that’s most important to him. In a chat with the broadcasters at the end of the game, he talks about how he can get into problems if his first thought is defensive. “I am at my best when I think positive intent first.” That instinct is crucial for India’s opener – else Shaheen Afridi might well have found his game especially after Rohit’s wicket. The pressure might have shifted on Virat Kohli to make use of the Powerplay by doing something he says he doesn’t want to do: “My game at No.3 is not to take risks that could affect the team,” Kohli said after his 51st hundred. For him to stay relatively risk-free, if Rohit isn’t around, it’s up to Gill to seize those little big moments against the new ball.
In the first game against Bangladesh, that intent came to the fore again. Sitting beside Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis in the show ‘Dressing Room’, Cheteshwar Pujara was suitably impressed by how Gill batted on the slow pitch where the ball wasn’t coming on. “He moved towards the ball, showed intent, it wasn’t easy to do that.” At the end of that game, Gill would talk about how he and Rohit had decided that they weren’t going to cut on that pitch – the shot that Kohli would get out trying. Neither would they drive on the front foot. The sluggish nature of the pitch had the ball stopping a touch – and both those shots are risky. Instead, Gill walked down the track, or pressed forward as much as he could, to get as close to the ball to push and punch. Or wait for the ball to come to him before punching off the back foot.

The maturity in not just planning but executing it captivated the likes of Pujara and Basit, and what makes him India’s most valuable batsman in this Champions Trophy. The challenge will come against a team like South Africa or New Zealand who will hit the lengths that Naseem Shah hit and draw him forward, and not allow him to drive by just leaning through his shots with a tiny stride out. The last one year from Miandad’s notes to Basit’s ‘ab maza le raha hai’ suggests he is up for the task, but time will tell.

Title: Caught in time-warp: Bangladesh and Pakistan out of Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-pakistan-bangladesh-eliminated-new-zealand-9854202/
Content:
In the 12th over of the New Zealand chase, Rachin Ravindra dug out a full ball to short midwicket and took a few steps down the track before turning back. Tanzid Hasan had a shy at the stumps and would have found the batsman out of his ground, but he missed the stumps.
And that was that, not just for Bangladesh’s chances in the ICC Champions Trophy, but also those of Pakistan. Chasing a modest target of 237 on a decent Rawalpindi pitch on Monday, the Kiwis had lost Will Young and Kane Williamson with just 15 runs on the board. Had Tanzid hit the stumps, New Zealand would have been 57/3 with Ravindra back in the pavilion for 25.
As it turned out, Ravindra – returning to the side after a horrific hit to the forehead – hit a classy 112 off 104 balls, replete with 12 fours and a big six – as the Kiwis secured a facile five-wicket win with 23 balls to spare to enter the semifinals, taking India along with them. Sunday’s contest between the two sides will decide the winner of the group.
The fourth-wicket stand worth 129 between Ravindra and the ever-reliable Tom Latham (55) broke the back of the chase. As the Kiwis approached the target at a rapid rate, the Bangladesh players seemed to lose interest and just went through the motions. Not that the match was lost in the second half. Despite losing three wickets for 72, New Zealand were never under run rate pressure as they adeptly rotated strike while finding boundary options whenever they wanted.
It was apt that both Bangladesh and Pakistan were knocked out together. After losing their early matches, neither team displayed the urgency and desperation in their must-win games. Nothing else can explain off-spinner Michael Bracewell being allowed to bowl 10 straight overs, starting in the first Powerplay, and taking four top-order wickets conceding only 26 runs, on a pitch that hardly offered any turn. The 34-year-old, who had 27 ODI wickets in as many games coming into the match, wouldn’t have believed his luck.
Matches in Pakistan have seen much higher scores than those in Dubai, and 236 was never going to be enough. But Bangladesh’s plan – if there was any – seemed just to play out the overs and hope for a miracle of sorts while bowling, an approach quite similar to the one adopted by Pakistan on Sunday.
What made the tactics employed by Nazmul Hassan Shanto’s team all the more explicable was that – after being reduced to 35/5 by India in their first game – they actually had a decent start with the openers putting on 45 in a little over eight overs. But once they lost a couple of wickets, the innings started regressing. The Bangladesh batsman, most of whom are quite experienced, failed to find the gaps for singles and two, only relying on the occasional big shot, thereby playing right into Kiwi hands.
The 10-over break-ups told the sorry tale of their innings. The Powerplay ended with the score reading a healthy 58/1. The next 10-over segment brought 39 runs for the loss of one wicket, while Bangladesh added only 34 as three batsmen were sent back. Matters hardly improved with overs 31-40 accruing just 41/1 with the score reading 172/6 going into the final 10 overs. Skipper Shanto looked to be keen on batting through the innings as he hardly ever looked to get out of second gear, scoring 77 off 110 balls before going for a big shot and perishing in the 38th over. It was only a few late blows from Jaker Ali (45 off 55) and Rishad Hossain (26 off 25) that got Bangladesh to 236.
For all the passionate support Bangladesh enjoys, the team is way behind the modern style of playing limited-overs cricket. Another major indictment was that despite playing on spin-friendly pitches back home, they seemed clueless against the disciplined-at-best bowling of Bracewell.
As for New Zealand, they once again demonstrated what a well-drilled outfit they are. They invariably find men to do the job in every game. It was Young against Pakistan and Ravindra on Monday. Significantly, both convincing wins were achieved without contributions from Williamson, their best batsman. Even when they lost a few wickets, unlike Bangladesh, they never went into their shell and kept the scoreboard moving.
As for their bowling, they have resources in both pace and spin departments. Bracewell, skipper Mitchell Santner and Glenn Phillips may not be world-beaters, but know how to get the job done. Matt Henry, William O’Rourke and the returning Kyle Jamieson are effective rather than spectacular. They had conceded a few extra runs in their opening win over Pakistan, but showed definite improvement in that regard as well on Monday. The 45th over bowled by O’Rourke was a maiden.

New Zealand are a habitual presence at the business end of major tournaments, and recently did the previously-unthinkable by clean-sweeping a Test series in India. Other teams better be wary.

Title: Behind Pakistan’s debacle: 26 selectors, 4 captains, 8 coaches and a system with gaping holes
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-champions-trophy-debacle-captains-coaches-gaping-hole-9854189/
Content:
Not even a week into an ICC tournament they are hosting for the first time since 1996, Pakistan are out of the Champions Trophy. After India humbled them in Dubai which pushed them close to the exit door, New Zealand by beating Bangladesh for their second win slammed the door on Pakistan at Rawalpindi. Having won both their Group A matches, India and New Zealand are through to the semi-finals, even as Group B remains wide open.
Pakistan’s tame surrender so far in the Champions Trophy, where they lost to both New Zealand and India isn’t just a problem with talent. It is also because of a system that is perennially undergoing structural changes. In the last three years, team has had 26 different selectors, 8 coaches and 4 captains.
While decoding Pakistan’s campaign, former captain Wasim Akram was brutal with his assessment. “There is nothing strong about Pakistan when it comes to cricket,” he would say with his former teammate with whom he shared an envious partnership with the ball Waqar Younis nodding in agreement.
In the lead up to the Champions Trophy the expectations were high. This was after all a team that had gone an entire year without playing an ODI since the 2023 World Cup, had posted series wins in South Africa and Australia. But as they found out through the course of the tri-series and the Champions Trophy all those expectations were clearly misplaced, and showed they haven’t learned lessons from the past.
Since winning the last edition of the Champions Trophy, apart from the T20 World Cups, where they reached one semi-final and a final in 2021 and 2022, their cricketing curve has been descending in ODIs and Tests. Since the World Test Championship came into effect, in three cycles their standing reads thus: 5th, 7th, 9th (bottom placed). In the 2019 and 2023 World Cup, they finished fifth, failing to even reach the semi-finals. And now in a 8-team Champions Trophy they have failed to get past the group stages.
Having gone about investing heavily on infrastructure for hosting the Champions Trophy, it appears Pakistan were never really ready for the tournament. Compared to their glory years, this is a team that is bereft of talent. Though they have historically relied on their pace pack, at different eras have had at least a couple of batsmen who were on par with the rest of the world, if not better.
But, in this current set-up their best batsman Babar Azam is miles behind the Fab Four. Beyond him, Pakistan doesn’t have a batsman, whose arrival can signal fear in the opposition. From being a mercurial side that gave world cricket moments that stand the test of time, they are now a team that plays predictable cricket.
Their current coach Aaqib Javed who took charge in November, said his prime focus is the Champions Trophy, a tournament for which he would be investing in continuity. “Our main focus at the moment is on ODI cricket ahead of the Champions Trophy. You’ll see a settled team in this format,” said Aaqib who was bowling coach of Sri Lanka in mid-2024 before becoming a selector of Pakistan and then becoming a head coach in a span of five weeks.
Also interestingly, while putting Aaqib in the hot seat, PCB also retained his spot in the selection committee, which his predecessor Gary Kirsten – hired after the 2023 World Cup to make Pakistan world beaters in white-ball — didn’t enjoy and led to his exit without even coaching them in a single ODI.
So for the Champions Trophy, despite pressing for continuity, Aaqib and his panel of selectors which includes former umpire Aleem Dar and stat analyst Hassan Cheema and three bureaucrats made changes at the eleventh hour. Though Saim Ayub’s unavailability was a huge setback for the batting unit, they dropped Abdullah Shafique one of the stand-out performers at the 2023 World Cup, on the back of his horrendous outing in South Africa where he became the first batsman to not get off the mark in a series.
In came Fakhar Zaman, who had fallen out with PCB after posting a critical comment for their decision to drop Babar. They also called back Faheem Ashraf who had not played any international cricket in the whole of 2024. And if all of it wasn’t enough, their three fast bowlers – Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf – whom Aaqib compared with the two Ws, have seldom shown signs of coming of age. Despite being capable of clocking 145kmph and more, the trio have appeared listless in terms of plans and execution.
Since the start of the tri-series and till their match against India, Afridi has figures of 3/88, 2/66, 1/45, 0/68 & 2/74. Shah has 0/70, 1/68, 2/43, 2/63 and 0/37. Rauf has played only three, and in those matches has gone for 1/23 (6.2 overs), 2/83 and 0/52.
For a team that produced many game changing moments with the ball that led to winning games from improbable situations, against India they appeared an attack that couldn’t ask any questions beyond the two deliveries that Afridi and Abrar Ahmed bowled.

Akram, summed up what has gone missing in Pakistan. “Characters are missing. The fearless, aggressive attitude is missing. We are getting used to being ordinary.” From extraordinary to just ordinary – Pakistan’s downward spiral is on without end in sight.

Title: Wasim Akram on Pakistan bowling unit: ‘Your three premier bowlers have average close to 50. You are not going to win any game unfortunately’

Content:
With hosts Pakistan losing its fourth match against India in an ICC event with the six-wicket loss against India in Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday, it was also Pakistan’s second loss in the tournament and almost shutting the door for the hosts for the tournament. With fast bowlers like Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah only accounting for two wickets in the match, former Pakistan great Wasim Akram has lashed out the pace trio of Pakistan and said Pakistan cannot win any game with such kind of bowlers.
“Are you talking about fast bowlers? Fast bowlers for which Pakistan is very famous for. That fast bowlers factories come in Pakistan and whatever comes to mind. I will tell you the stats. Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is our main bowler. He has bowled 47 overs conceding 341 runs taking eight wickets at an average of 43. I am not talking of batting but bowling. Then Haris Rauf. Two matches out of five matches he was injured (Probably he thought who will play five matches, so get injured in two). Three wickets with an average of 52. Then Naseem Shah. 56 average and five wickets. Your three premier bowlers have average close to 50. You are not going to win any game unfortunately,” Akram said while sharing his thoughts on the show ‘Dressing Room’.
With India restricting Pakistan to a total of 241 on Sunday, it was the fourth time in the last ten ODIs between the two countries that Pakistan failed to cross the 250-run mark. Both Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah failed to take a wicket in the match and Akram also found the image of Shah throwing the ball to the wicket-keeper in the match as a perfect example of what is  lacking in Pakistan players’ attitude. “There should be one more rule for the selectors. The one person, no matter how good he is, who does not have a throw should not be allowed to play white ball cricket. Naseem Shah throws like he is hitting in a fair. We were taught from great Javed Miandad, great Imran Khan and Mudassar Nazar that your job is to throw from third man like a bullet so that opposition should get to know that we are on the ball. We are on the money. And if I am throwing the first ball of the match like in a fair and the wicket-keeper, a lion’s kid (laughs), also stands there okay and doesn’t go close to the ball, these small things matter,” shared Akram.
Pakistan team management once again had shown faith in the likes of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan apart from recalling Imam-ul-Haq in place of injured Fakhar Zaman apart from the same bowling unit, which suffered loss against New Zealand in the opening match of the tournament.

Akram’s long-time team-mate and compatriot Waqar Younis believes that Pakistan cricket needs ‘surgery’ to regain the past glory. “When we lost in the World Cup, Naqvi sahib (Mohsin Naqvi, PCB Chairman) said I will do the operation, You don’t do open heart surgery. When you do open heart surgery, then there is lots of blood. You do the surgery in a way that you let it remain closed and the surgery also happens. I think it is important to see who are the players who are capable of playing the modern way of cricket. We are behind the world. If one says this time is not right, then do the surgery post Champions Trophy. You see which of these kids can come in and then as Wasim bhai said, give them time. It’s an old disease and you will create a wound and it will take time to heal,” Younis said on the show.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘Virat Kohli’s engine room is ODI cricket and it could be his second innings’: R Ashwin on batter’s 51st ODI ton

Content:
With his 51st ODI hundred against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy match at Dubai on Sunday, Virat Kohli hit his first International hundred since the hundred against Australia in the Perth Test match during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. Kohli, who had only amassed 190 runs in nine Test innings in Australia in the Border-Gavaskar trophy, had got out six times to off side deliveries followed by a half-century in three ODI matches against England last month. Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has shared how he did not see those dismissals in red ball cricket as any ‘doubts’ and ODI cricket being Kohli’s engine room.
“I never had any doubt about Virat’s quality. When we were playing in Australia, people were criticizing that he was nicking the ball in the slips. People should understand that there was grass on the wicket and it was red ball cricket and he was nicking in Test match cricket. And there was so much talk over that. One gets out in the slips, one gets out clean bowled and one also is out as LBW. He was getting out in slips. Okay What is there in that? I don’t read massively into it. Virat’s class has not gone anywhere. I always said Virat Kohli’s engine room is ODI cricket. I am glad he is playing ODI cricket and this well could be his second coming. His confidence will only increase,” said Ashwin on his Youtube channel Ash ki Baat.
Kohli also surpassed the 14,000 run mark during his knock against Pakistan on Sunday. Kohli was 15 runs short of the 14,000-run mark prior to the match against Pakistan and reached the milestone with a boundary against Haris Rauf in the 13th over of India’s innings. Kohli is the third batsman after compatriot Sachin Tendulkar and Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakarra to cross the 14,000 run mark in ODI cricket. Kohli’s feat has come in 350 ODI innings, 28 fewer innings than Sangakkara and 63 fewer innings than Tendulkar.
“We were saying prior to the match that it could be Virat Kohli’s game and I had a good gut feeling. What an absolute stellar knock by Virat Kohli. 51st ODI hundred and 14,000 runs in ODI cricket, 60-70 matches less than the previous best batsman. What more can I say? He is an amazing player,” said Ashwin.

Ashwin also talked about the cover drives hit by Kohli in the match against Pakistan pacers. While the shot has also accounted for Kohli’s dismissal in recent times, Ashwin believes that Kohli’s cover drive does the talking for him. “I would talk about one cover drive in the match. He hit the extra cover drive showing that it’s his biggest strength That cover dive between cover and mid off and the way he caressed the Haris Rouf delivery was fantastic. Another one was where  Virat carssed the on the up little outside ball to the left of extra cover for boundary beating the sweeper cover. When Virat Kohli is on song, this cover drive does all the talking. Virat does not do any of the talking,” said Ashwin.

While the talk has been about Virat Kohli’s 51st ODI hundred during India’s six wicket win over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy match at Dubai on Sunday, left-arm wrist Kuldeep Yadav returned back to form in International cricket with a three-wicket haul. Yadav had made a comeback to international cricket after more than three months in January early this year post a sports hernia injury, a soft tissue injury that happens on an athlete’s groin area. With wickets of Slaman Ali Agha, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah in the match against Pakistan, the 30-year-old had his best wicket haul in his last four matches since injury and former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has backed the bowler for the comeback.
“People should understand that a spinner is making a comeback after an injury. Sometimes in our country, we don’t give so much time to the bowlers. If the batsman fails after a comeback, we tell that he has just come after an injury. If you think it happens with Virat and he plays 2-3 games, then what do they say? Everyone will say the king will be back. Kuldeep Yadav is also like that. He has some miracle in his hands. He does the job. He showed the world today,” said Ashwin on his Youtube channel Ash ki Baat.
Prior to the injury, Yadav had played in the ODI series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka followed by the first Test in Test series against New Zealand followed by his groin surgery weeks later. In the last three ODIs, Yadav had only two wickets under his belt. The 30-year-old spinner went wicket-less during India’s six-wicket win over Bangladesh and gave away 28 runs in his first six overs against Pakistan. Yadav then removed Salman Ali Agha with an overspin delivery followed by the dismissal of Shaheen Shah Afridi off the next delivery before he removed Naseem Shah later in his spell. Ashwin insisted that spinners like Kuldeep can change the match within minutes. “As spinners, our life changes in two minutes. One more example from the match was Kuldeep Yadav. One Salman Ali Agha. Kuldeep bowled a beautiful googly like a top spin and Salman got beaten in the flight. It’s not easy to beat a batsman like Salman in the air. I have seen lots of batsmen. And the next ball, he trapped Shaheen Shah Afridi LBW. What an amazing bowling Kuldeep did,” said Ashwin.

Yadav has now picked up 15 wickets in the six ODIs he has played against Pakistan. Ashwin also opined that the Dubai wicket had its challenges but Kuldeep utilized it to his advantage. People have to understand what Kuldeep’s injury was. Sports Hernia is what? It happens below the hip and it’s very important for a spinner for hip drive. He has just come back from that so it will take him some time. But another difficult thing in these conditions in Dubai is that the wicket is dead. No matter how many revolutions you will give, the ball will stop in the wicket and because of the rotations, a spinner’s ball gets fast after falling because of the rotations and goes out of pitch. If it is not doing with the surface, the cut grass makes it even more difficult. So Kuldeep did a fantastic job on such a wicket,” said Ashwin.

Title: ‘Was doing the math for his hundred’: Axar Patel on Virat Kohli’s ton vs PAK in Champions Trophy

As Virat Kohli closed in on his century against arch-rival Pakistan in the Champions Trophy 2025 clash, all-rounder Axar Patel started doing mathematical calculations in his head to ensure that his senior teammate reached his 82nd century.
Axar walked into bat with India needing 19 runs to win and Kohli unbeaten on 86. “At the end, actually main bhi thoda maths kar raha tha unke hundred ke liye (Even I was doing the math for his hundred towards the end). I was hoping that I don’t edge the ball or something. So, it was quite fun,” Axar said in a video posted by ICC.
While Axar became a human calculator crunching numbers in his head, Pakistani pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi bowled three wides in the 42nd over making Kohli’s path to the century a bit tricky. At one point, Axar was even booed for taking a single, as fans wanted Kohli to get maximum strike.

“It was the first time I got to watch a high-pressure game from the dressing room where Virat bhaiya scored a century. I had a lot of fun, and the way he was running between the wickets after fielding for 50 overs is a testament to his fitness,” Axar added.
With just two runs needed in the 43rd over, Kohli was stranded on 96 and skipper Rohit Sharma cheekily gestured for him to finish the game with a six. Kohli finished the game with an elegant drive through the covers to finish the game and bring up his 51st hundred in style.

With dominant wins over Bangladesh and Pakistan, India are all but through to the Champions Trophy semifinals.

Title: ‘Let’s move on from them’: Mohammad Hafeez wants PAK to look past Shaheen Afridi and co in pace department
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammad-hafeez-pak-to-move-on-shaheen-afridi-pace-bowlers-9853923/
Content:
Former Pakistan player Mohammad Hafeez slammed the Men in Green’s pace attack consisting of Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf after their 6-wicket loss against India in Dubai on Sunday which has put them on the brink of an early exit from the tournament. Hafeez said that it was time for Pakistan to look ahead from this pace trio and give others a chance.
“Since the Asia Cup in 2023, we were expecting this trio of Shaheen, Naseem, and Haris to deliver trophies for us. But they’ve been unsuccessful. The 2023 World Cup, a disaster. The 2022 T20 tournament in Melbourne, a disaster. And now, this Champions Trophy, another failure,” he said in PTV’s coverage of the Champions Trophy.
“It is time to realise that these guys, according to many people they have skills but these skills are not enough for them to win Pakistan the big tournaments. They are not proving themselves capable of helping Pakistan win a big tournament. Let’s move on from them. Let’s bring other people. Let’s go with Mohammad Ali, Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Akif Javed, Mir Hamza. These guys are waiting for their chances. Let’s see what happens if we play them. They are also Pakistani; they also have a Pakistani passport,” he added.

A post shared by tapmad (@tapmad.entertainment)
The current Pakistan pace bowling trio has had a Champions Trophy to forget, conceding more than 200 runs against New Zealand in the tournament opener and then failing to defend 242 runs against India in a must-win game on Sunday.

In order to stay alive in the tournament now, Pakistan have to pray that Bangladesh upset New Zealand on Thursday and then defeat Bangladesh in the last group game. They’ll also be hoping that India can beat New Zealand in the other group game on Sunday so that net run rate comes into play.

Title: Sanjay Bangar says Shubman Gill will lead India’s batting in years to come
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sanjay-bangar-shubman-gill-praise-india-batting-future-9853816/
Content:
Former India player Sanjay Bangar heaped praises on India ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill and said that the Punjab player will lead the Indian team’s batting in the years to come. The 25-year-old continued his stellar performances in the ODI format when he made a classy 46 against Pakistan on Sunday.
“Clearly, he’s the guy who is going to shoulder the responsibility of the Indian team going forward in years to come,” Bangar said on JioHotstar.
“(His) foundations are really, really strong and add to that the confidence of nearly two-and-a-half years of performing in one-day cricket. In one-day cricket, he’s been phenomenal. Now look, the straight drive, the on-drive are the shots wherein you cannot actually hit the ball really hard. But here, he was hitting the ball so hard that despite the mid-off and the mid-on fielder being on that 30-yard circle, the ball was going and hitting them. That’s the kind of timing he possesses,” he added.
Before his steady innings against Pakistan, Gill had scored a century against Bangladesh in India’s Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh, helping his team to a win.
Last week, Gill had dethroned Pakistan’s Babar Azam from the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings by India. In the latest ICC rankings list, Gill has 796 rating points while Babar has 773. India skipper Rohit Sharma is ranked third with 761 points. South Africa’s Henrich Klaasen and New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell at fourth and fifth respectively.
“Look, see, nothing grows under a banyan tree and the banyan tree of Indian cricket is basically Rohit Sharma and with him, Virat Kohli. But when you look at Shubman Gill, those two straight drives, even the blistering cover drive, this is like a blitzkrieg where the opposition is taken aback, you know, it’s awe-inspiring,” Navjot Singh Sidhu said on JioHotstar.

“This man has emerged from the shadows of that banyan tree and has come of age. It’s tough to say that. You rate ability in men by what they finish, not by what they attempt. When you actually take your side through after scoring a hundred and don’t throw your wicket, that responsibility is making you better,” he added.

RCB also have the devastating Elyse Perry in their ranks who scored 81 runs against the MI in the last match even though the Bengaluru side’s middle order failed to spark to life.
The Warriorz, meanwhile, will look to maintain the high that the win against Delhi gave them and rise up the table by upsetting their more-fancied opponents. With the likes of Tahlia McGrath and Sophie Ecclestone in their team, Mandhana will not be taking the UP side lightly.

AUS vs SA Champions Trophy 2025 Match Schedule, Live Streaming, Date, Head to Head, Playing XI Prediction, Pitch Report, Weather: The reigning ODI champions Australia will take on South Africa in their second match of the ongoing Champions Trophy at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. Australia in their opening match defeated England by five wickets after they chased down 352 runs in Lahore. Meanwhile, South Africa in their opening match hammered Afghanistan by 107 runs in Karachi.
Australia are missing seven members of the squad that lifted the World Cup Trophy 15 months ago in India. Skipper Pat Cummins (ankle), fellow quick Josh Hazlewood (hip) and all-rounder Mitch Marsh (back) were already ruled out and the shock recent retirement of Marcus Stoinis earlier this month left selectors scrambling to find replacements. Mitchell Starc pulled out due to personal reasons.
The AUS vs SA match will happen on Tuesday at 2.30 pm with the toss at 2 pm (IST). The match will be played at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi. The match will be broadcast on TV on Star Sports and Sports 18 channels. You can also livestream the AUS vs SA match on JioHotstar.
Australia squad: Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Spencer Johnson, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matt Short, Adam Zampa. Travelling reserve: Cooper Connolly
South Africa squad: Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Rassie van der Dussen, Corbin Bosch. Travelling reserve: Kwena Maphaka
Australia XI: Travis Head, Matt Short, Steve Smith (c), Marnus Labuschagne, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey, Glenn Maxwell, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Spencer Johnson, Adam Zampa
South Africa XI: Temba Bavuma (c), Ryan Rickelton, Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi
Total Matches: 110
Australia won: 51
South Africa won: 55
Tied: 3
No Result: 1
There’s a significant chance of rain, with predictions ranging from 50% to 70% probability. The temperature is expected to hover around 15 degrees Celsius. Temperatures may range from 14 to 24 degrees Celsius. In essence, the weather forecast indicates a high likelihood of rain, which could potentially disrupt the match.
The Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium is generally known for its batting-friendly pitch. Expect to see high scores, as the pitch tends to be flat with good bounce and pace. As the game wears on, the pitch tends to slow down, which can bring spinners into play. Spinners could find good turn and variable bounce. Recent ODI games played at this venue have seen large scores being chased down. Given the batting-friendly nature of the pitch and the potential for dew, the team winning the toss might prefer to field first.

Title: Pakistan reactions: From off-key ‘Dil ke armaan aansuon mein…’ of Shoaib Malik to Shoaib Akhtar’s ‘won’t even watch them if not paid money to watch on TV’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-reactions-from-off-key-dil-ke-armaan-aansuon-mein-of-shoaib-malik-to-shoaib-akhtars-wont-even-watch-them-if-not-paid-money-to-watch-on-tv-9853536/
Content:
The two Shoaibs, Akhtar and Malik, led the many stages of grief as Pakistan plunged into semi-caricatured mourning after yet another defeat to India in an ICC tournament – this time, a 6 wicket win topped by Virat Kohli’s century.
While Shoaib Akhtar declared, “Had I not been paid money to sit on TV, I would have not even watched them play,”, Shoaib Malik broke into an off-key rendition of ‘Dil ke armaan aansuon mein beh gaye’, going out of tune, not because he was choking with grief, but because of his non-singing voice which is certainly nothing like Atif Aslam’s.
But it was the everyday fans who took to Twitter for pouring their hearts out on the dejection and disappointment, with one account holder falling visibly sick due to not eating and anxiety and growing disappointment, and popping pills on camera, vowing to never follow the team. He also gave hourly updates of how he couldn’t sleep and wad progressively feeling worse as the night wore on.
Another Twitter user, conceded, “As Pakistanis we should collectively apologise for ever comparing Babar to Kohli, taubah taubah yeh to Gill k bhi qareeb nahi hai,” which collected 21.8K likes. He found sympathisers among Indian respondents who besides asking him to not compare Babar to Gill, also instructed him to shoe more respect to former “real greats” Imran Khan, Saeed Anwar and even the 2017 CT winning team. “Jeez i feel like slapping myself for ever putting babar & kohli in same sentence,” he would reiterate.
The prelude and epilogue to the match had seen Twitter rife with fans sarcastically thanking ICC for not scheduling the game in Pakistan. One livid Lahore fan wrote, “Thanks for not playing in Lahore and embarrasing us. India toh safe rehti, main apni team ko urra deta,” he said, unforgiving of the failure.
But Shoaib Akhtar in multiple dark-background videos posted on his social media accounts, vented his hopelessness. From bravely saying he wasn’t disappointed because the result was inevitable, he ended the post with a resigned “Yes, I’m disappointed.”
He would later turn up at a studio and declare, “I don’t even want to talk about Pakistan cricket. I don’t want to discuss these players; I have no interest in wasting my time on them. Had I not been paid money to sit on TV, I would have not even watched them play”
He had spent the day as their batting dawdled, declaring the problem wasn’t ‘intent’, but that Pakistan players had no skillset in the first place. “We have clueless management, brainless captaincy and a very average team. These players know nothing about cricket honestly. You want to talk about intent? These Pakistan players don’t even have the skill to play cricket,” he raged.
Former womens captain Sana Mir declared the team was unsalvagable. “Pakistan lost the Champions Trophy the day their squad was announced. With this squad even MS Dhoni or Younis Khan would have failed to win Pakistan this tournament,” she said.
Akhtar rued the empty cabinets, “There’s no talent in Pakistan. Can you compare Babar Azam to Virat Kohli? Can you compare Imam Ul Haq to Rohit Sharma? Can you compare Khushdil Shah to Shreyas Iyer? There’s no talent in our team. Sorry, no talent.”
Ahmad Shahzad, one of the poster boys of a previous false dawn, was distraught.  He said, “Pakistan team had China’s superstars and Indian team had real superstars. This is the worst Pakistan cricket team in history.”
While Mohammad Amir called for people involved in the selection of this Pakistan team to come forward and resign, saying, “Most players in this Pakistan team have played 5-6 ICC events. This is the time to do proper surgery now,” Waqar Younis said, the surgery needed to be laser tech.
“We are way behind other teams. We need to do surgery in the team, we need new players. Laser surgery in the team is important. Select players who can play modern-day cricket and remove players who play outdated cricket,” Younis said.
Rashid Latif was relatively restrained and brutally blunt: “Team India has no match with Pakistan cricket team, you cannot compare them anymore. The reality is India is far, far ahead of us. We cannot beat teams like India.”
Wasim Akram, ever the optimist, called for the cliched overhaul, throwing up new names. “It is now time to get rid of these players, they have been losing us ICC events for the last few years. PCB needs to take a bold step and remove these players, it is embarrasing. Pakistan’s team needs new players,” he said.
Babar being lumped with the King’s crown without winning anything seemed to be angering the former players. Mohammad Hafeez said “Babar Azam has been playing for 10 years. Show me his Player of the Match award against India. Show me one award that he won in the matches he played against India.”
Shoaib Malik, who has a century against India, said it was a Hollywood get carried away by rankings: “We celebrated Babar Azam’s No. 1 ranking in ODI cricket. But what did he win for Pakistan with that ranking? We should have celebrated match-winning performances for Pakistan and not individual rankings.”
Hafeez said Babar’s failures against India were vivid. “Babar Azam is not a match-winner like Inzamam Ul Haq. Inzamam used to win matches for Pakistan in difficult situations. Babar has never won Pakistan a single match against India. Has he ever won Player of the Series award in SENA? Has he won any match for Pakistan in Australia? We need to move on and give opportunities to other players. We need to choose players who can win us ICC events,” he said.
He was also confused about why Imam ul Haq was recalled. “Imam Ul Haq was removed from the team because of his low strike-rate. He came back into the team, scored 10 runs off 26 balls at strike-rate of 38,” he ranted.
While Pakistan losses aren’t particularly new, and India are hardly made to sweat in these duels, the gulf between the two sides threw up the unlikeliest of admissions of failure, where the Indian team wasn’t even the object of their hate: Pakistan cricket was. They found surprising empaths in Indian fans, those who showed sense to not gloat. Some even registered the existence of wonder-spinner, Abrar, his dream delivery and SMH-inducing send-off.
And just like that the new Indo-Pak, Gill vs Abrar rivalry was born.

At his pre-match press conference before the big game against India, Bangladesh cricket team captain Najmul Hossain Shanto heaped praise on his pace attack. Then he spoke about 22-year-old Nahid Rana, who has not played too many games for Bangladesh, but is already making waves.

“We have struggled in the past when it comes to fast bowling. But we have a good attack now and as a captain it makes me excited to see our bowlers bowl fast. They are in good form…. Hopefully they will be able to put Indians under pressure,” Shanto said. “Rana played one Test against India and he has the experience. He is not someone who looks at the opponent, but is more focused on execution. He is looking forward to the game.”

While Nahid Rana did not play for the game against India, he has been handed a game against New Zealand. And he could hold the keys for the chances of teams like Bangladesh and Pakistan, if the Tigers are to defend a target of 237 against New Zealand in Rawalpindi.
Nahid Rana is a pacer who will be playing in his first ICC tournament at the Champions Trophy. He’s shown that he is capable of reaching speeds north of 150km/h. He frequently throws thunderbolts over 145kph.

He has so far played for Bangladesh in six Tests in 2024 but just the three ODIs.
He played against India in the Chennai Test in 2024 where he claimed two wickets, both of Yashasvi Jaiswal in two innings. In the first innings in particular, he gave a measure of what sorts of pace he can generate, after getting Jaiswal’s wicket with a 148kmph delivery.
“The opportunity to play against the best cricketers in the world is the highest form of inspiration,” Rana was quoted as saying by ICC’s website. “I am enjoying every moment of international cricket. Things have happened very fast but I’m grateful for everything. It is never easy to adapt to international cricket but I was lucky in the sense that I got to play a good number of first-class matches before my debut.
Nahid Rana added: “I feel that is the best thing that could have happened as you get exposed to all sorts of different situations and conditions. But international cricket is a totally different level altogether.”
Rana started playing serious cricket in his late teens, having grown up in Rajshahi, on the international border with India. He didn’t really play in the age group teams of Bangladesh.
“The place is more famous for mangoes rather than cricket, or any sport for that matter,” Nahid Rana said. “I was mainly playing taped tennis ball cricket (growing up) and could feel I was way quicker than those around me. I could extract more natural bounce because of my height.”

Virat Kohli has admitted that the outside off-stump line has been his “weakness” over the years but it has been also his “strength.” Virat Kohli on Sunday became the fastest batter and third man to reach 14,000 runs in one-day international cricket on Sunday, before going on to hit a record-extending 51st century in the ODI format.

“It’s a catch-22,” Virat Kohli told BCCI.tv.
“I mean, it’s kind of been my weakness as well over the years, but I’ve scored a lot of runs on that shot.

A post shared by Team India (@indiancricketteam)
“I think today was just about backing my shots and I think the first couple of boundaries I got were cover drives on the rise, so I really had to just let it go a little bit and take a bit of risk and follow through with my shots, because when I hit those kind of shots, then I feel in control when I bat out there, so it was a good innings for me personally and as you said, it was a great team win.

“I was able to bat the way I wanted to bat and to contribute in a winning cause in an important game obviously feels big, so yeah, it was imperative that we get stuck in and get this win to be able to qualify.”
Virat Kohli powered the chase to finish on 100 not out — hitting the winning boundary — as India beat Pakistan by six wickets with 45 balls remaining.

“One thing that I’ve always thought of batting at three is to minimise risk and make sure that I put my team in a winning position and if you have a chance to finish off the game in a chase, obviously that’s much better and I always preferred that kind of a situation, but yeah, my role over the years has remained the same, whatever the demand of the game, I put my head down and try to do that,” he said.
“The occasion is always a bit more lively when you play against Pakistan, especially in this region because you have equal number of fans from both countries and yeah, it was a great day for us as a team and for me personally as well.”

Title: Babar Azam is a fraud, you’ve picked wrong heroes: Shoaib Akhtar tells PAK fans

Former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar has called Babar Azam a “fraud” and said he has been a fraud from the beginning. This was after the former Pakistan captain couldn’t make an impact with the bat against India, with the Men in Green ultimately losing the match by 6 wickets and are almost out of the Champions Trophy.
“We always compare Babar Azam to Virat Kohli. Now tell me who is hero of Virat Kohli? Sachin Tendulkar and he has scored 100 centuries and Virat is chasing his legacy,” Shoaib Akhtar said on the show “Game On Hai.”
“Who is Babar Azam’s hero? Tuk tuk (Without naming any cricketer),” he said.

“You have picked the wrong heroes. Your thought process is wrong. You were a fraud from the beginning.
“I would not even wish to talk about Pakistan cricket team. I am only doing this because I am getting paid.
“This is a waste of time. This deterioration I am seeing since 2001. I have worked with the captains, whose personality used to chance thrice a day,” said Shoaib.
After losing to New Zealand in the first game of the Champions Trophy, Pakistan were handed a six-wicket defeat on Sunday by India in Dubai.

Akhtar was also full of praise for India’s game-winner Virat Kohli, who ended the night with an unbeaten century.
“We have seen this in the past. When you tell Virat Kohli that he has to play against Pakistan, he will score a century. Hats off to him, he’s like a superstar! He’s a white ball run chaser! Modern-day great! No doubt about him. I’m very happy for him. He deserves all the praise,” Akhtar said.

Shoaib Akhtar has also lampooned Pakistan management.
“I am not disappointed at all (by the defeat to India) because I knew what would happen. You can’t select five bowlers, the whole world is playing six bowlers… you go with two all-rounders but this is just brainless and clueless management. I am really disappointed,” Akhtar said in an emotional video that he posted on his X account.

“Babar Azam is not Inzamam-ul-Haq.
“Inzi bhai used to win matches for Pakistan in difficult conditions.
“Babar Azam has not won a single match against India to date.
“He is playing for the past 10 years and has never become a player of the series in SENA countries. In Australia or England he has never led Pakistan to victory.
“We need to show them the mirror. We need to realise that those who we are banking on are not performing and we should move on from them.
“Give the opportunity to them who are waiting in the system.”
India tops the group with four points and has virtually secured its semifinal place. It will play New Zealand in its final league game in Dubai on March 2.
Pakistan flies back to take on Bangladesh on Thursday, with a painful exit looming from its home tournament.

“Would you rate Babar to Virat?,” Shoaib asked in the show “Game On Hai.”
“Would you rate Shreyas Iyer to Khushdil Shah?
“Would you rate Rohit Sharma to Mohammad Rizwan?
“For the past ten years I am listenting this is a talented group. Where is the talent? You become star by socring runs and taking wickets. I can’t see any talent.

“It was an utterly disappointing and heartless performance from Pakistan. But we should not be surprised because its not happening for the first time.

“We talk about intent all the time but I think they even don’t have the skillset. i don’t know what to tell them they are just not good enough.
“It is a clueless management, brainless captaincy. Absolutely average team who displayed their average skillset out in the middle and there is nothing to talk about it. They don’t have any game awareness,” he said.
Shoaib Malik, another panelist on the show said this Pakistan cricket team are a good four overs cricketer but when it comes to the ODI they are just not good enough.
“Ye chaar overs ke batters and 4 overs ke bowlers (They are batters and bowlers of four overs). And in the one-day cricket you can’t win games with these players. We have potential in T20 cricket but we don’t know how to convert those potential in the longer formats,” said Malik.
Meanwhile, Mohammad Hafeez said there is talent in Pakistan cricket team but the management is clueless.
“Talent is there but there is no planning. By choice they didn’t picked a quality opener. By choice we didn’t picked an extra spinner. We dominated in these conditions for the past ten years as a home team. We should know what the winning mantra of Dubai,” said Hafeez.
“To me 240 on this track was a very good total. If we would have a quality spinners, the result could have been different.”

Content:
Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar lauded Virat Kohli’s technique against the spinners versus Pakistan on Sunday. Virat Kohli powered the chase to finish on 100 not out — hitting the winning boundary — as India beat Pakistan by six wickets with 45 balls remaining.
“Well, I think he waited for the ball today,” Sanjay Bangar told JioHotstar.
“He didn’t really, was on the front foot all the time. He waited for the ball to come to him, was aggressive self, was willing to cover the infield as well.
“But here against spin, what I saw in the first half of his innings, he was playing a lot of the back foot.
“And then once he got that confidence, then he started coming forward. He came forward to left arm spin and off spin. But against leg spin, he was happy to stay back.
“But once he sorts of figured him in, then he started getting on to the front foot as well.
“So, starting off the back foot and then gradually going on to the front foot as well.”
Bangar insisted that Kohli can still play for the next three four years at the international level.
“I think more than the work I put in, it’s about his hard work and his dedication to the game,” he said.
“Because he is a guy who leaves no stone unturned as far as preparation is concerned. He knew that he had to step up. He brought that intensity to his game and you could see it in his body language.
“You could see in the way his eyes lit up and that fire was burning there.
“He was hungry for runs and boy oh boy! Today was an innings of which we can certainly say what Navjot Singh Sidhu just said- another 3-4 years of international cricket, easily.
“Because if you can maintain that side of standards in terms of execution of pure skill and intent, you get a master class like this.”

Legendary Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram has made a scathing attack on the Mohammad Rizwan-led side after their six-wicket loss against India in Group A of the ongoing Champions Trophy. Defending champions and hosts Pakistan are now on the brink of getting eliminated from the team.
“Drastic steps needed. We are playing archaic cricket in white-ball for ages,” Wasim Akram said on the show “Dressing Room.”

“This need to change. Bring fearless cricketers, young blood into the team. If you have to make five-six changes. Please make it.
“You keep losing for next six months. Its fine but start building team for World T20 2026 from now onwards,” he said.
Wasim Akram also lambasted Pakistan’s bowling as they have the second worst average in the ODI cricket.

“Enough is enough. You have made them the stars. In the last five ODIs, Pakistan bowlers have managed to get 24 wickets at an average of 60. That is 60 runs per wicket.
“Our average is even poor than Oman and USA. In 14 teams who are playing ODIs, Pakistan’s bowling average is second worst,” he said.
Wasim Akram also questioned the selection for the Champions Trophy and asked Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi to question the coach, captain and the selectors.
“Chairman saab pls call captain, selection committee and coach and ask them what kind of selection they have made.
“Khusdil Shah and Salam Agha did they ever looked like taking wickets?
“I am literally shouting for weeks that this squad is not good but chairman said they have assembled the best squad.

“Even captain (Rizwan) is to blame. He is the leader of the ship and if he doesn’t know what kind of match-winner he needs. Its getting embarrassing now.
“You should have seen the faces of Pakistan fans who were at the stadium. They left the venue after 15 overs when Pakistan were bowling.
“I have never seen anything like that in my life. It’s unfortunate.  We as a nation we are very passionate. But its frustrating.”

Bangladesh find themselves in a must-win game against New Zealand in a Group A game on Monday. Bangladesh lost their opening game against India and will take on Pakistan in their final game. While Bangladesh will by buoyed by the fact that they could have veteran player Mahmudullah available to play against New Zealand after missing the game vs India with a hamstring niggle, the Black Caps are in imperious form coming into the game. They dispatched Pakistan by 60 runs in their opener, with Will Young and Tom Latham scoring centuries while Glenn Phillips blasted a half century.
Here’s what to expect from the pitch at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and the weather in the city of Rawalpindi for the New Zealand vs Bangladesh cricket match:
The pitch in Rawalpindi is expected to aid a high-scoring contest with a bit of assistance to the seamers. If the past is any indication, pacers might receive some early assistance. But as the game progresses, the surface is likely to favour batters.
“We’ve got a few plans for Bangladesh, but I think we obviously – we have to wait and see what the wicket does,” said New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner. “If it is pretty flat I think it is probably similar stuff to what we’ve been operating in in Karachi. It’s hitting that hard length for a long period of time and then we know they have some destructive players in their line-up as well.”
The weather forecast for the city of Rawalpindi for Monday predicts a cloudy day with chances for rainfall. Temperatures are likely to hover in the 20s, which will be ideal playing conditions for both teams.
Bangladesh: Tanzid Hasan, Soumya Sarkar, Najmul Hossain Shanto(c), Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Towhid Hridoy, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Mahmudullah, Nasum Ahmed, Parvez Hossain Emon, Nahid Rana.

Former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja has slammed Pakistan cricket team for their timid performance against India as they lost the match by six-wickets and are on the brink of getting eliminated from the Champions Trophy.
“Siwaay toss ke aap kya jeete (What have you won barring the toss),” Ajay Jadeja said in the show “Dressing Room.”
“Kya aapne dil jeeta (Did you win any heart). Itni hype ke baad aisa performance (After such hype the kind of performance was very disappointing)
“Although India won but I am bit disappointed with the overall game. Pakistan didn’t even win a moment in the match. I am happy for India but cricket lost.”
“Pakistan don’t have the skills that we used to associate with them in the past. Their fitness was also questionable,” he said.
“What I was disappointed with this team is that the current Pakistan side don’t have the skillset.”
India tops the group with four points and has virtually secured its semifinal place. It will play New Zealand in its final league game in Dubai on March 2.
Pakistan flies back to take on Bangladesh on Thursday, with a painful exit looming from its home tournament.
Virat Kohli’s 100 not out led India to a six-wicket win over arch rival Pakistan in their Group A clash at the Champions Trophy on Sunday.
Kohli reached 14,000 runs in ODIs on his way to a record-extending 51st hundred as India finished with 244 for 4 in 42.3 overs. Shreyas Iyer scored 56 off 67 balls as he and Kohli put on 114 runs off 128 balls for the third wicket.
Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav took 3 for 40 and Pakistan was bowled out for 241 in 49.4 overs after winning the toss and opting to bat.

New Zealand will look to make it two wins out of two matches with the Black Caps taking on Bangladesh on Monday in Rawalpindi. The Bangla Tigers are in a virtual must win situation here with a loss eliminating both them and Pakistan from the tournament.
With India current topping Group A with 4 points and if New Zealand win against Bangladesh that virtually settles the group with Pakistan and Bangladesh playing each other in the final game which will just be for pride. However, the clash on Monday might not be a walk in the park for the Kiwis with Bangladesh having all the tools to cause an upset.
With Will Young scoring an all-important century against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy opener in the absence of Rachin Ravindra, the Kiwis are expected to continue with the same playing XI for this match against Bangladesh as well. Rachin, who suffered a forehead injury in the Tri-Series opener against Pakistan a couple of weeks back, is expected to be eased into the team even if he has healed properly.
In a do or die clash, the Bangla Tigers might turn to their seamer Nahid Rana who was a force to be reckoned with against Pakistan in a Test series last year. With the conditions and pitch favouring seamers in Rawalpindi, Khan might get to show his skills in the very stadium that made him a household name back in September.
Bangladesh: Tanzid Hasan, Soumya Sarkar, Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Towhid Hridoy, Mushfiqur Rahim/Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Nahid Rana, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman

After losing to New Zealand in the first game of the Champions Trophy, Pakistan were handed a six-wicket defeat on Sunday by India in Dubai.

In a series of clips he shared on his social media handle, Akhtar slammed the way Pakistan team had gone about its business. He pointed out the team selection of an all-rounder-heavy side. The former fast bowler lampooned the team and said that they couldn’t even match the skills of the Men in Blue players like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill.

“I am not disappointed at all (by the defeat to India) because I knew what would happen. You can’t select five bowlers, the whole world is playing six bowlers… you go with two all-rounders but this is just brainless and clueless management. I am really disappointed,” Akhtar said in an emotional video that he posted on his X account. “We can’t blame the kids (Pakistan players); The players are just as the team management is! They don’t know what to do. The intent is a different thing, they don’t have the skillsets like Rohit, Virat, and Shubman. Neither they know anything, nor the management. They have just gone to play without any clear direction. No one knows what they should do.”

Akhtar was also full of praise for India’s game-winner Virat Kohli, who ended the night with an unbeaten century.
“We have seen this in the past. When you tell Virat Kohli that he has to play against Pakistan, he will score a century. Hats off to him, he’s like a superstar! He’s a white ball run chaser! Modern-day great! No doubt about him. I’m very happy for him. He deserves all the praise,” Akhtar said.

Title: IND vs PAK | Champions Trophy: Clinical India show timid Pakistan why they are stuck in a different era
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-pak-champions-trophy-clinical-india-timid-pakistan-9852607/
Content:
How much did Pakistan miss a batsman of Virat Kohli’s caliber in the middle-order? How much did they wish they had openers like Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill who showed the urgency to kill the game in the first powerplay? Where are they going to unearth spinners who could collectively choke the opposition in the middle overs? Will their fast-bowling trio, often compared to those in the 90s, ever show there is more to them than numbers that pop on speed gun? When will they realise that unless their fitness parameters improve, they will continue to remain an ordinary fielding outfit that drops catches that could win them matches?
If Pakistan do some soul searching, which they are likely to do once the confirmation arrives with regards to the elimination from the Champions Trophy, they need not look beyond India. Since winning the Champions Trophy final against India at the Oval in 2017, this was their sixth straight defeat in completed matches against their arch-rivals. At least till the rivalry retains its hype, it is pertinent Pakistan turns a corner sooner or later.
“I think we could have won a bit earlier, could have been a convincing win based on how the wicket was playing,” Shreyas Iyer, who scored a handy 56, said. “It was initially coming on pretty well with the new ball and after that it was difficult to score runs when the ball got a bit old. But if we had played more aggressively we would have won a bit earlier I felt.”

As has been the case in recent times in matches involving these two teams, India showed how much they have traveled as a white-ball group. Pakistan, on the other hand, with their timid approach in the afternoon and listless bowling plans in the evening, showed they are stuck in a different era and lag far behind modern teams. That their captain Mohammad Rizwan called routine wins by New Zealand and India as brave showed they are in denial.
And more than anything else, it is their batting that needs new heroes. Despite getting the chance to bat first on a pitch that was getting slower as the night progressed, it was India who out-batted them. On such pitches, teams seek runs against the new ball before they begin to accumulate in the middle overs in the hope of shifting gears in the later stages. But when Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam walked in, there was no such urgency. Of course, they scored more than they did so against the Kiwis in the opener, but 52/2 in the powerplay could have been better as India scored 64/1 in the same phase.
As Rizwan said later, if they were indeed looking for a total of 270-plus, their middle order seldom came close to providing that momentum. Instead, alongside Saud Shakeel, Rizwan stitched a 104-run stand in 145 deliveries for the third wicket, which meant once India were well in the game once they removed the set batters. And Pakistan’s worst fears came true, when they lost three wickets in the space of four overs, and their No 9 Naseem Shah was out in the middle by the 43rd over.
And who did the damage for India? It was their three all-rounders and a wily wrist-spinner – resources that Pakistan had during their heydays in the 90s. Against an Indian batting line-up that boasts of depth till No 9, a total of 241 was well below par.
In the second half, it was the turn for India’s batsmen to deliver some brutal lessons. Despite having the disadvantage of batting second, it was admirable how India overcame the conditions, with the help of Pakistan’s attack. In the first match, Bangladesh attacked while defending 228, by taking pace off the ball and troubled India in the middle overs. But Pakistan, with just one specialist spinner, had to rely extensively on their pace trio in search of wickets that were hard to come by.
It took a special delivery from Shaheen Shah Afridi to uproot Rohit Sharma’s stumps. And it took another unplayable one from Abrar Ahmed to dismiss Shubman Gill who looked set for another good score after being dropped by Kushdil Shah earlier. But beyond those two deliveries, not once they came close to troubling the likes of Kohli and Shreyas Iyer.

When Iyer joined Kohli with 100 on board, Abrar was in the middle of a good spell. But at no time did they enter into a shell, like Pakistan’s No. 3 and 4 did. They used their feet and expanded their range to pick singles through the large gaps, and never let a bad ball go unpunished. As they picked pace, the writing was very much on the wall for Pakistan before Kohli nailed it with a boundary that also brought up his century.

Title: Virat Kohli after game-winning century against Pakistan: ‘Will put my feet up for a few days’

Virat Kohli’s century powered India to a famous six-wicket victory in the group stage of the Champions Trophy at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday. Kohli also broke Sachin Tendulkar’s record for being the fastest batter to go past 14,000 runs. It must be mentioned that he’s also the fastest past the 9,000, 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 and 13,000-run marks.
The 36-year-old is only the third batter to do so after Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara.
After the win over Pakistan, Team India now have a full week’s break till they face New Zealand on Sunday in their final group A game in Dubai.
Asked about having a week’s break, Kohli grinned and said: “To be honest, at 36, it feels really good. Will put my feet up for a few days as it takes a lot out of me to put that kind of effort into every game.”
READ MORE: 14,000, 82nd, and 158, numbers from record-breaking match of Virat Kohli against Pakistan
Talking about his innings against Pakistan, Kohli said: “To be honest, it feels good to be able to bat in that manner in an important game to seal qualification. It feels good to contribute in a game where we lost Rohit (Sharma) early, had to put in the understanding of what we learnt in the last game. My job was to control the middle overs against the spinners without taking too many risks, towards the end Shreyas (Iyer) accelerated and I got a few boundaries as well. It allowed me to play my usual ODI game.
“I have a decent understanding of my game, it is about keeping the outside noise away, staying in my space and taking care of my energy levels and thoughts. Very easy to get pulled into the expectations. My job is to stay in the present and do a job for the team. My keynotes to myself are to put my 100% every ball in the field, and then God eventually rewards you. Having clarity is important, it was important to understand that you need to get runs when there is pace on the ball, otherwise the spinners can dictate things. Shubman (Gill) did well against Shaheen (Shah Afridi), took him up. There’s a reason he’s the number one batter of the world. It was necessary to get about 60-70 runs in the powerplay, or we’d always be chasing the game. And there Shreyas is really coming into his own at number 4. Did well in India, and now out here as well.”

Title: IND vs PAK ICC Champions Trophy: Five key pointers that signified the gulf in class between the teams
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-pak-champions-trophy-five-pointers-gulf-between-teams-9852586/
Content:
– Pakistan were off to a decent start, but lost two wickets just before the end of the first Powerplay. Mohammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel immediately went into a shell. On the other hand, India, despite losing Rohit Sharma relatively early, didn’t hit the brakes too hard. Between overs 11-20, Pakistan scored just 27 runs and faced 36 dots (60%) while India scored 45 runs and played 25 dots (41.7%)
– While Pakistan were able to gradually build in the middle overs, India triggered a collapse soon after. Set batters Rizwan and Shakeel were dismissed in back-to-back overs, just after the second drinks break. Pakistan went from 151/2 in the 34th over to 200/7 in the 43rd over. India, after Rohit’s cameo, had two match-defining partnerships that never allowed Pakistan a footing in the game.
– Axar Patel’s direct hit to dismiss Imam-ul-haq was the highlight of India’s solid fielding effort. There were a couple of tough chances dropped but those didn’t prove costly, and India’s catching and ground fielding was in general of a high standard. Pakistan, however, dropped Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, and their athleticism on the field was questioned even by former captain Wasim Akram on air.
– Iyer struggled at the start of his innings. Usually strong against spin, he had difficulty putting Abrar Ahmed away. At one stage, he was on 16 off 32 balls. But this was another area of difference. His start wasn’t dissimilar to Rizwan’s but Iyer showed he had gears to move through, as he raced through to a half-century. While Rizwan finished with a strike rate of 59.74, Shreyas ended on 83.58.

– While India’s spearhead Mohammed Shami had an off day, the rest of the bowling unit collectively stepped up – all five of the other bowlers picked up wickets, with Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya being especially effective. For Pakistan, after one magic delivery from Shaheen Afridi to get Rohit, it was just Abrar who fought a lone battle. The spinner rightly received congratulations from Kohli for figures of 1/28.

Former Indian captain Virat Kohli scored a century against arch rival Pakistan in the second group game of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, decimating the opponents’ target of 242.
With this innings, Kohli ended the looming questions about his struggles in the format, after scoring 22 runs in the last game against Bangladesh.
Indian skipper Rohit Sharma was all praises for his colleague in the post-match presentation ceremony. “Virat loves representing the country and wants to be out there playing for the team, doing what he does best. Over the years, we’ve seen this, and those in the dressing room aren’t surprised by his performance. It was good for him to finish the game, with a couple of crucial contributions from others,” said Rohit.
Coming at number three, Kohli scored 100 runs off 111 balls scoring his 82nd career century and 51st century in the One Day Internationals. He also became the fastest-ever batter in the world to reach the 14,000 runs mark. He breached the mark in his 287th inning passing the previous record of Sachin Tendulkar who did in 356th inning.
Talking about his innings, Virat said, “To be honest, it feels good to be able to bat in that manner in an important game to seal qualification. My job was to control the middle overs against the spinners without taking too many risks, towards the end Shreyas accelerated and I got a few boundaries as well. It allowed me to play my usual ODI game.”
In an innings decorated with seven fours, Kohli started slowly but soon took on Haris Rauf dishing a couple of exotic cover drives.
Despite struggling against spinners, Kohli kept grinding and scored the winning runs to steer India to another win against Pakistan. This was Kohli’s first-ever century in the Champions Trophy and also became the first batter to score an ODI century against Pakistan in the World Cup, Champions Trophy and Asia Cup.
Kohli will look to continue his form against New Zealand in the final group game scheduled on 02nd March 2025.

Title: A night made in Dubai for Virat Kohli: fastest to 14k runs and 51st hundred in ODIs as India dismiss Pak
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ind-vs-pak-virat-kohli-nights-9852512/
Content:
These are nights made for Virat Kohli. The gaze of the cricketing world fixed on Dubai, the most feverish cricketing rivalry playing out in front of packed stands, live streams buffering to manage the viewership load, a million hands folded in prayer, hearts beating in wild anxiety — the myth and legend of Kohli comes alive and branches out into an altogether different world. It’s on nights like these that Kohli leaves his stamp on mind and memories, blurring allegiances and differences.
In the end, it was a routine cruise for India, overhauling the 244-run target Pakistan had set in 42.3 overs with six wickets in hand and effectively progressing to the knockouts. There were co-architects in this victory, most notably Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya. But only Kolhi, as it is on nights when he hits the high gears of batting, mattered.
Anticipation brimmed much before the match started. For a 1 pm start on what was Dubai’s warmest day of the season, several thousand fans had begun to queue up as early as 10 am. On the 2-km stretch to the stadium, where the blue jerseys clearly outnumbered the green, it was hard to spot one without “Virat” or “Kohli” on the back. The most famous No. 18 in the game. From the moment he stepped out in training gear half an hour before the toss – with the team bus getting stuck in the traffic – mobile phones tracked every moment of his. And he filled their hearts as well as the stands with euphoria.
The modern-day batting great, arguably the greatest in this 50-over format, scripted his 51st hundred and crossed 14,000 runs in ODIs. But numbers are only embellishments in celebrating a glorious hundred, filled with strokes that matched the grandness of the night. Fittingly, he completed his century off the last ball of the game, gliding down the track and clubbing Khushdil Shah over extra cover for a four in what ended up as the last ball of the game.
The stroke was in tune with his majestic stroke-play of the night. He has etched far greater knocks, in difficult situations against bowlers of more hostility and craft. But this knock will be celebrated for those daring strokes. There was something vintage about Kohli here, in his buoyant body language, in his intensity, and in how authoritatively he bossed a quality bowling attack.
Classicism shone through, especially when he drove the ball. Aptly, he marked his 14,000th ODI run with an imperious cover drive. Strokes of more authority followed. Like when he swiped Shaheen Shah Afridi down the ground with a flamingo flourish off the back leg. Or when he smeared Naseem Shah over extra cover. It was as though the thrill and joy that overflowed in the gallery had intoxicated him enough to produce one smashing shot after the other.
Kohli, however, would downplay all that during the chat with the host broadcasters. “I have a decent understanding of my game. It is about keeping the outside noise away, staying in my space and taking care of my energy levels and thoughts. Very easy to get pulled into expectations. My job is to stay in the present and do a job for the team,” he said.
This hundred, his fourth against Pakistan, came at the right time for India and Kohli. Since the season’s start, there has been no end to his struggles, with even his lone hundred in the Perth Test coming in relatively batting-friendly conditions. But here, Kohli overcame the slow conditions that he has struggled with in recent times. On a pitch where it was hard to be fluent, one had to rely on singles and twos. It tested his fitness levels, but he still pushed his body to the limits — this 111-ball knock had only seven boundaries but it had 46 singles and 13 doubles. More importantly, he got them at a strike-rate of 90.09. But even those singles had an intense aesthetic about them; ODI cricket will remember Kohli as the batsman who put art into running between the wickets.
This was also a game where it was not just about Kohli’s batting. Before he strode out to bat, Kohli had lifted India’s intensity on the field when the bowlers were struggling to make inroads. Stationed inside the ring for most part of the innings, he ensured Pakistan batsmen wouldn’t get any easy singles past him. He dived around, charged in to stop close singles, slid to stop singles from turning into twos. Each time he touched the ball, the capacity crowd, which included fans from Pakistan, cleared their throats.

No bowler posed any resistance, later. Afridi was blunted, Naseem Shah punctured, mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed clinically dissected and Haris Rauf nullified without much ado. “My job was to control the middle overs against the spinners without taking too many risks. Towards the end, Shreyas accelerated and I got a few boundaries as well. It allowed me to play my usual ODI game,” he said.
For once, though, even Kohli admitted he was exhausted, emotionally as well as physically. “Will put my feet up for a few days as it takes a lot out of me to put that kind of effort into every game,” he said, with an eye on India’s next game on March 2 against New Zealand.
Sunday night, meanwhile, will never perish in the mind of the viewers. For, these are the nights made for Kohli.

Title: Champions Trophy, IND vs PAK Quick comment: Pakistan no longer fighters, adventurous or innovators
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-cricket-decline-ind-vs-pak-champions-trophy-9852453/
Content:
The galaxy of greats in the commentary box want Shaheen Shah Afridi to bowl a bouncer. He had got Rohit Sharma with a stunning yorker, but Subhman Gill was to soon hit a gorgeously-correct straight drive, looking flawlessly fabulous in his front-foot play. South Africa pace legend Dale Steyn says bowlers need to experiment when things aren’t going their way. A surprise short ball can see a confident ‘straight-driving’ batsman gloving the ball to the keeper, he says. Afridi runs in hard, but it isn’t a short ball. It’s full again and Gill steps down the ground and hits it over the bowler’s head.
This would be one of the many moments in the ICC Champions Trophy league game when Pakistan looked inadequate and outdated. They looked meek, they didn’t innovate. This looked like a team that wasn’t in touch with the changes the white-ball game has seen over the years. India’s one-sided win virtually knocked them out of the tournament. This early exit was symbolic – Pakistan no longer seemed to have the class to be among the game’s elite. This was the Champions Trophy and Pakistan, by no stretch of imagination, looks like a champion side.
There was hurt and pain in the voices of former Pakistan cricketers in the box. Mohammad Rizwan’s team was a shadow of the teams of the past. Back in the day, Pakistan was known for its fearless cricket, street-smart tactics and famous for cricketers who thought out of the box. They have made generous contribution to the world cricket narrative, and are responsible for enriching the game. They have thrown up inspirational captains, speed maniacs, sultans of swing, the doosra and reverse swing.
On Sunday, that famous Pakistan enterprise and adventure was missing. Be the old-timers Babar Azam or Rizwan or youngsters Salman Agha and Tayyab Tahir or even Khushdil Shah – there was a lack of intensity and courage. Like Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill, there was no one to put pressure on the bowlers with their aggression. They didn’t push the envelope or take calculated risks. There was no one to disturb the discipline of bowlers, like Shreyas Iyer did later. When the spinners tried to challenge him to cut by keeping the point boundary vacant, he would reverse-sweep. Pakistan batsmen even didn’t sweep much.
Imam-ul-Haq couldn’t steal a single from mid-off even after stepping down the track to drive the ball. There were two reasons – he was slow and Axar Patel was sharp and committed. It was a virtue none of the Pakistan fielders had. Virat Kohli would keep taking his ones and twos between the boundaries – as he knew the art of ODI batting. He could drive between gaps and even defend the ball by opening the face of the bat.

It was said that Pakistan gives its best when the world writes them off. These days they give their worst when pushed to a corner.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy, IND vs PAK: Virat Kohli slams 51st ODI century as India defeat Pakistan by 6 wickets
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ind-vs-pak-virat-kohli-51-odi-century-result-9852399/
Content:
Virat Kohli brought up his 51st ODI century as he guided India to a win over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday. This defeat puts Pakistan on the brink of elimination as they’ll have to pray that Bangladesh defeat New Zealand on Monday and then they themselves have to defeat Bangladesh in their last group match with the net run rate likely to come in play.
Kohli who looked in inspired form got to his milestone in 111 deliveries in an innings studded with 7 fours. It was a typical photo finish to the contest as Kohli got to his century in the last ball of the match, slamming a boundary. He was ably supported in the middle by Shreyas Iyer who scored a half century in 63 deliveries after an uncharacteristic slow start before shifting gears.
Earlier, Kohli had become the fastest batter to reach 14,000 ODI runs during the match against Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. The 36-year-old Kohli surpassed Sachin Tendulkar (350 innings), by achieving the feat in only 287 innings. Kohli got to the landmark when he reached 15 runs in the chase against Pakistan.
Kohli is only the third batter ever to reach the milestone after Tendulkar and Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara who crossed the milestone in 378 innings in 2015. The former India captain only took 10 innings to cross from 13,000 to 14,000. In September 2023, Kohli reached his 13,000th ODI run, incidentally while playing Pakistan in the Asia Cup in Colombo.
Earlier, India bowled out Pakistan for 241 with Saud Shakeel top-scoring for Pakistan with a 62 off 76 balls, while skipper Mohammad Rizwan made a laborious 46 from 77 deliveries as the two batters added 104 runs for the third wicket.
Khushdil Shah chipped in with a 39-ball 38 to lift Pakistan after they slipped to 165 for five at the start of the 37th over.
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) picked up three wickets after all-rounder Hardik Pandya (2/31) dismissed Babar Azam (23) and Shakeel.

Harshit Rana bowled an excellent last over, picking up a wicket without conceding a run.

Title: Champions Trophy | IND vs PAK: How Virat Kohli got to the magical 14,000 runs club with a show-stopper cover drive
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ind-vs-pak-virat-kohli-14000-cover-drive-9852298/
Content:
Virat Kohli struck the pose, and watched in awe the ball’s untrammelled journey to the fence past the cover region. A content smile spread, as the electronic scoreboard blinked: 14,000 ODI runs. It could not have been a deliberate act, but it was fitting he rang in his milestone moment with a stroke that has defined him. The Kohli cover drive. A stroke of standalone glitter. He might not be the most graceful essayer of the shot, not the most powerful, natural or audacious either. But few have executed that shot with as much energy. This stroke embodies the word intent that Kohli often dwelled upon during his captaincy days.

It’s a stroke that he had acquired than he was born with. With his bottom-hand dominant grip, the shot is filled with dangers. But the key, when he is driving fluently, is that he makes the contact as close to the body as possible. The alignment of the body is artful. Still head, upper body leaning towards his left toes, the bat coming down in a sweet arc. He once detailed the mechanics of it. “When you’re driving on the up, you need to make sure that you are connecting with the ball in a way that you can see the ball bounce in front of you before heading out in the outfield. The ball should ideally bounce around two feet in front of you. That’s when you know that you have actually connected very well and you’re in control of the drive. If it goes up in the air, then more often than not, it’s just a risky shot that came off.” This one was not risky, but flowed from his bat like a beautiful song.

And with it, Kohli reached 14,000 ODI runs from 63 innings fewer than his idol Sachin Tendulkar. The maestro got there from 350 innings, also against Pakistan, also in February. And 19 years later, the heir to his throne overtook yet another ODI milestone in the most fitting way possible.

Title: Hardik Pandya with two wickets and 31 dot balls helps India apply brakes on Pakistan

Content:
As Saud Shakeel holed out at the deep, Hardik Pandya’s jubilation knew no bounds. In his career, has done it all – bowling last over thrillers in T20s, providing key breakthroughs every now and then. During the 2023 World Cup, an injury he suffered showed how much it alters the balance of the side, even if it allowed Mohammed Shami to have a tournament to remember.
India vs Pakistan Match LIVE Cricket Score Online Updates: Watch Here
On Sunday, against Pakistan, Pandya showed he is as good as any frontline bowler, when he is fit and firing.
Coming into the tournament, Pandya knew he would have a huge role to play with the ball, particularly given India leaning towards a three-spinner strategy. With Jasprit Bumrah unavailable, and given Mohammed Shami’s ordinary returns in the middle overs and Harshit Rana’s inexperience, for India’s spinners to be effective they needed Pandya more than ever with the ball.
IND vs PAK LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
A seamer who could provide them control when spinners went about their business at the other end.
On Sunday, India had to turn to Pandya a lot earlier than they expected — by the seventh over when Shami hobbled off the field holding his calf. Pandya didn’t have any time to loosen up in the middle with Babar Azam starting to press the gas. When he got the ball in hand, he predominantly struck to the off-stump line even when Babar creamed him for a couple of boundaries through the off. But off the eighth ball he bowled, Pandya dragged back the length – the ideal one to bowl here, and had Babar nick one to KL Rahul. And he was off.
India vs Pakistan LIVE Cricket Match Streaming Online: Watch Here
On a pitch where the spinners were supposed to keep Pakistan’s batting quiet, it was Pandya who did it all in his next four overs after the run-out of Imam-ul-Haq which saw Pakistan end the first powerplay at 52/2.
Despite all the noise over their lack of intent in their opener at Karachi, during the hastily arranged session their former head coach Mudassar Nazar had reminded Pakistan how their old-school approach would come in handy in the conditions in Dubai. On a pitch where a total of 260 looked par, with two power-hitters, Salman Agha and Kushdil Shah slotted to bat at the death, preserving wickets in hand seemed a sensible ploy here. It is what their captain Muhammad Rizwan and Saud Shakeel would go about enforcing.
Having consumed 42 dot balls in the first powerplay, despite having a spread out field, Rizwan and Shakeel would eat up 38 in the next 10 overs. Out of those 16 would be delivered by Pandya, who would not give Rizwan and Shakeel any chance to free their arms. Constantly hitting that back of a good length, he would keep landing it around the off-stump channel, getting the ball to seam in and out slightly.
Every now and then he would surprise them with cutters as Pakistan would score just 27 runs between overs 11 and 20, with only seven coming off Pandya’s four overs. His first spell read 6-0-18-1 out of which 26 were dot balls.
Given Pandya’s influence, Rohit would use Shami and Rana for second spells. It was a cat and mouse game now with the two Pakistan batsmen showing admirable resistance. With over-rate to catch up, Rohit would turn to its three spinners thereafter, but with just a slight turn on offer, Rizwan and Shakeel – who has a good game against spinners thanks to his long grind in domestic cricket — would play with minimum risks.
For a brief period in the middle between 24.2 to 26.1 overs, Rizwan and Shakeel would show urgency hitting two boundaries each, but Rohit would rely on their exceptional fielders to put the pressure back. With left-right combination strong on the square and targeting the huge pockets to rotate strike, India would place their best fielders – Shreyas Iyer, Jadeja and Axar manning the boundaries on either side of the square. The Pakistan pair would make India spend every ounce of their energy under the heat with fielders charging in to cut down the angles and prevent twos into ones.
With Rizwan not prepared to go for lofted shots straight down the ground and using the sweep as an option, Rohit would position a fielder each at deep square-leg and deep mid-wicket. If runs had to come, it was only going to come at a premium.
Someone had to blink and it was Rizwan who did which led to Pakistan losing three wickets in the space of 19 deliveries. With mid-on up, he would step out to clear Axar, but only to miss the line completely as India got their first wicket in the middle-overs, having gone wicketless against Bangladesh.
In the next over, Pandya now in his second spell would get rid of Shakeel. Unlike his first spell, with a relatively softer ball, he was prepared to take pace off it and was rewarded by Shakeel who was early through the pull, which was mistimed to Axar at deep square-leg. Pandya would leap in joy. So did the Indian fans at the stands. He may have had just two wickets to show, but those 31 dot balls were like gold. An over later, when Jadeja broke through the defence of Tayyab Tahir, India had them at 165/5. Pakistan lost their way in the middle overs, only this time without Bumrah causing them any trouble.

Pakistan need a win desperately against arch-rivals India in the game on Sunday at Dubai International Stadium. Pakistan had lost the first game of the group stage to New Zealand, leaving them with a mountain to climb in their remaining two games in the group A of the Champions Trophy.
Only the top two teams from each group qualifies for the semis. Failure to make it to the semis will be disastrous for Pakistan because they are the hosts of the event. Pakistan are also the defending champions of the Champions Trophy, having won the title the last time it was held in 2017.

India captain Rohit Sharma became the fastest ODI opener to reach 9000 runs during the Champions Trophy 2025 match against Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Sunday.
The 37-year-old Rohit reached the mark with his first run of the match, making him only the sixth ODI opener to cross 9000 runs. Rohit joined Sachin Tendulkar (15310), Sanath Jayasuriya (12740), Chris Gayle (10179), Adam Gilchrist (9200), and Sourav Ganguly (9146) in the elite club.
Rohit, however, eclipsed all other batters in becoming the fastest opener to reach 9000 ODI runs, achieving the feat in only his 181st innings in the position. Rohit surpassed Tendulkar who had previously held the record, having scaled 9000 in 197 innings as an opener. In the previous game against Bangladesh, the Mumbaikar joined the 11,000-run ODI club in only his 261st innings, the second-quickest to the mark behind teammate Virat Kohli (222).
In 2023, Rohit reached 8000 runs as an opener and 10000 runs in the format in the same match against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup. Rohit became the fastest to the 8000-run milestone, overtaking Hashim Amla (176 innings) by scaling the mark in his 160th outing.
Posing a 55-plus average, Rohit tops the charts among all 54 batters who have aggregated at least 3000 runs in the position in the 50-over format. With over 15,000 runs as an opener across formats, Rohit ranks seventh on the all-time list. Rohit’s 44 centuries as an opener across formats is only bettered by David Warner (49) and Tendulkar (45).

The pair of wides from Shaheen Shah Afridi could’ve potentially turned him into a villain had Virat Kohli missed out on the century. But the Indian great stayed composed, took his twos, and even a single that was there for the taking as he inched close to his 51st ton, and first of the Champions Trophy. The 14000 peak had been scaled, but there’s an addictive charm to the 100 – and while he ensured India were safely taken to the target against Pakistan, the stadium could be seen heaving in anticipation of that well-deserved 100. Kohli was reassured with the calm clever Axar Patel at the other end. And Patel’s single to allow Kohli strike and a chance to get to the milestone was cheered equally loudly. With the spinner on, And skipper Rohit Sharma manifesting a 6 from Kohli, the No 3 knew even with the target constricting, he could go forthe big one. He stepped out to Khushdil finally and the lofted drive was almost a relief as the loopy 4 took Kohli to the 100 off 111 balls. The Indian win was inevitable, but the Kohli 100 simply made it a sweet, smiling sonata finish. Not sure what he said, but he seemed to be saying Main Hoo Naa – as he wrapped up the chase.
– Shivani Naik
Bangladesh will be well justified in claiming that they gave India a tougher game than Pakistan ever managed. Despite losing half their side for next to nothing, Nazmul Hossain Shanto’s team showed some grit and fight to cobble up a decent total. Towhid Hridoy scored a memorable hundred and Bangladesh even dismissed many of India’s top batsmen with a decent part of the target still to achieve. Pakistan, on the other hand, never seemed to threaten India. They got two wickets with memorable deliveries – just as well, as they couldn’t rely on their fielders to hold on to even routine chances, till almost the end of the game. After the defeat to New Zealand, Sunday’s match was a must-win game for them, but there was no trace of the desperation inherent in their situation. Their overall performance on the day was full of timidity. They seemed to be just going through the motions and feeling sorry for themselves in the process. A lot of it was due to the wide gulf in class between the two sides, but even overmatched sides have often been known to make it difficult for stronger sides.

First, over 6.4. Shaheen Shah Afridi would have still been feeling the adrenaline rush after bowling a sensational inswinging yorker to dismiss Rohit Sharma in his previous over. But when he bowled a full length delivery to Shubman Gill, the in-form Indian opener pushed it past the bowler with an elegant ease. The off-drive past the bowler is said to be one of the toughest shots to play against fast bowlers especially when there is a hint of movement. Then, over 8.2. Gill brought out the cover drive this time as Shaheen landed one on a similar length. This one was angling away from him, and so he used it to pierce the gap through the off side. And just as he did in the previous over, Shubman held the pose. Two gorgeous pieces of timing from a player in the middle of a purple patch.

Ten overs down and the required run rate just under seven, Pakistan decided to bring in Haris Rauf. The pacer may leak runs but the first powerplay was done with and Rizwan needed his best wicket-taker to remove that pesky Virat Kohli-Shubman Gill duo. And it took him just three balls to start asking questions from India. Kohli, looking to pull the third ball of the over, realised the shot wasn’t on and top-edged the ball. But Naseem Shah, much to Rauf’s chagrin, didn’t attack the ball for a catch. Immediately after it was Gill’s turn to give and take away hope from Rauf. It was a delivery that rose to the hip, one that was swatted away by a Gill pull but didn’t gain or lose height and went straight to Khushdil, who dropped the fast-moving ball. Two, more-than-half-chances missed for Rauf. Kohli made him pay for them in his next over, punching two different variations of his cover drives to the boundary, while completing 14,000 ODI runs in the process.

On a sunnier day, Haris Rauf would have sung his redemption song against the team, or precisely the man, that had demystified his hard-length scorchers. The Pakistan seamer had admitted that his life has never been the same after the sixes Virat Kohli had flayed him for a pair of impossible sixes at the MCG. He lost a bit of his vim, his energy and the halo that was assuming blaze. But in his first spell, third ball, he provoked a top edge from Kohli, from a skiddy lifter that speared into him. Kohli nearly pulled away from the short, but could not withdraw in time. The leading edge fell safely, but Rauf was chagrined that Naseem Shah did not go at full pelt to catch the ball. He hit the turf and cast a stink eye. But he would get redder, angrier next ball to Shubman Gill. Another back of lengthner, even hotter, followed. Gill, in pristine touch when driving full balls, could only pull the ball feebly towards Khushdil Shah at midwicket. Rauf had begun to celebrate only to see the ball burst through the fielder’s palms. He was too distraught to even shout expletives, and hunkered down, his hand on head.

Virat Kohli stuck the pose, and watched in awe the ball’s untrammelled journey to the fence past the cover region. A content smile spread, as the electronic scoreboard blinked: 14,000 ODI runs. It could not have been a deliberate act, but it was fitting he rang in his milestone moment with a stroke that has defined him. The Kohli cover drive. A stroke of standalone glitter. He might not be the most graceful essayer of the shot, not the most powerful, natural or audacious either. But few have executed that shot with as much energy. This stroke embodies the word intent that Kohli often dwelled upon during his captaincy days.
It’s a stroke that he had acquired than he was born with. With his bottom-hand dominant grip, the shot is filled with dangers. But the key, when he is driving fluently, is that he makes the contact as close to the body as possible. The alignment of the body is artful. Still head, upper body leaning towards his left toes, the bat coming down in a sweet arc. He once detailed the mechanics of it. “When you’re driving on the up, you need to make sure that you are connecting with the ball in a way that you can see the ball bounce in front of you before heading out in the outfield. The ball should ideally bounce around two feet in front of you. That’s when you know that you have actually connected very well and you’re in control of the drive. If it goes up in the air, then more often than not, it’s just a risky shot that came off.” This one was not risky, but flowed from his bat like a beautiful song.

The way Shubman Gill was going, something special was needed if Pakistan had to get back into the game. Abrar Ahmed provided that bit of magic with a delivery he will be telling his grandkids about. He is classified as a leg-spinner, but flicked one from the front of his hand which drifted towards leg-stump, prompting Gill to shape up for a nudge onto the onside. It was more like the carrom-ball made famous by Ravichandran Ashwin. But imagine his horror as it spun across his body and bounced to hit the top of middle-stump. The opener stared at the spot from where the ball performed its mischief for a long time before starting his walk back to the pavilion, unnecessarily shown the way by the bowler. Even Virat Kohli was impressed by the ball that broke the partnership that had put India in the box seat. India-Pakistan matches make indelible memories and heroes. Abrar may be able to dine on that magic ball for the rest of his days.

Mohammed Shami, at his best, is at it from the word go. When he is in rhythm, he hardly wastes any time in hitting the right lines and lengths. But it wasn’t the case on Sunday as he struggled to get his radar right. In an over that would have given flashbacks to 90s kids of the stat to the 2003 World Cup final, Shami had to bowl 11 deliveries to complete a legal 6-ball over. It wasn’t quite like the 15 runs that Zaheer Khan conceded that forgettable day in Johannesburg, but it was the first sign that something was off with Shami in Dubai. He then went off the field, pointing to his shoes. By the time he got close to finishing his third over, the physio was out, massaging his right calf. Shami then slow-walked into the dressing room. A couple of days after his 5-for, it was a worrying start to the big day for India’s ICC hero. Somewhere in Dubai, Sunil Gavaskar must have muttered to himself that cricket is a great leveller.

Babar Azam made a watchful start on Sunday. After his slow 64 in the previous game, the knives were out for Pakistan’s best batsman of this generation. Babar left alone a couple of balls, then used the straight face of the bat to cut out risk. Both Mohammed Shami and Harshit Rana gave him some time to settle down by bowling wides. Babar didn’t seem able to get the ball off the square till he worked the ball to the leg side for a couple against Rana. But in the fourth over, bowled by Rana, Babar got going. He used his wrists to guide the incoming ball to the mid-wicker fence. Two balls later, he unfurled a lovely cover drive to a delivery outside off stump. Then a pitched up delivery by Hardik Pandya, called into service early because Shami had a niggle, was driven through the covers. The real shot of intent came a little later. Babar stepped down the track and launched Axar Patel over mid-on and to the boundary. But Hardik had the last laugh. Driven again for four, he got Babar to drive the next ball only for him to nick it to KL Rahul. The slight away movement did Babar in. 23 off 26 with 5 fours. Another Babar innings gone down the drain.
– Nihal Koshie
Pakistani openers were shaping up nicely in the first powerplay with batting that was steady yet watchful. But the Indian team bounced back in the last overs as Hardik Pandya lured Babar into playing a cover drive nicking one behind to KL Rahul and giving him a bit of a send-off. The next one was a throwback to the glorious 90s – and it was a theme that will never stop bringing merriment to Indians and draw out wry gasps from Pakistan fans. After Pandya’s send-off of Babar, Axar Patel brought his rocket arms into action as he rifled a throw to catch Imam short of the crease who ran mindlessly for a quick single. The languid uncle Inzamam ul Haq had contrived myriad ways to make reaching the crease elusive, in his day for famous run outs. His nephew Imam would not be accused of being lazy, but the desperation to get the single, saw him go rabbiting riskily with the bat being grounded only when he saw the throw steaming in. Pakistan fans would’ve wondered wordlessly how run outs run in the much adored batting family. At any rate, Rohit will probably promise one more dinner for that run-out and India had balanced out the powerplay with Pakistan finishing with 52/2 in ten overs. The powerplay had looked promising for Pakistan when the much-scrutinized Babar played a couple of classic textbook cricketing shots, and later took on Hardik Pandya to score another boundary before going down the pitch to pick another four against Axar. Imam was not looking at his 100%, he played cautiously and it looked like Pakistan would close out the first powerplay without any casualty. But his Go-go Rabbit-ways ruined the powerplay for Pakistan.
– Pritish Raj
While commentator Wasim Akram was asked about Pakistan opener Imam-ul-Haq’s run out in the tenth over with an Axar Patel throw striking similarly to his former team-mate and Haq’s uncle Inzamam-ul-Haq run-outs in his career, Akram and Sunil Gavaskar were bantering over the run-out tendency running in the Haq family. It takes us back to Pakistan’s group match against Australia at Headingley, Leeds in the 1999 ODI World Cup. A yorker from Damien Fleming in the 47th over of Pakistan’s innings saw Inzy stuttering and falling over just outside the crease as non-striker Wasim Akram ran towards the striker’s end with Haq being run out by Fleming. Akram had shared the incident multiple times in the past and recalled Haq’s words to him. “Wasim bhai, aap yahan kahan (Wasim,where are you here)?” Akram had told the media earlier. A day prior to today’s match, when asked by Navjot Singh Sidhu about the incident, Akram’s take on the incident, Haq was quick to answer, ‘We decided that we have to take a run so that I get to bat. Tell me one thing, one batsman has fallen down. You don’t see it and you come running. Have you tied a cloth on your eyes? What did you do?,” Haq narrated on Star Sports on Saturday. Pakistan had won the match then by ten runs and Imam-ul-Haq too would hope that his team eventually wins the match today.

161 dot balls against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy opener which let the run rate climb sharply during the chase of 321. Good teams learn from such mistakes. But not Pakistan. Credit to the Indian fast bowlers, especially Hardik for giving Pakistan batsmen no room to free their arms. There were reinforcements in place to cut out Mohammad Rizwan’s sweep option. The wicket wasn’t two-paced but perhaps a bit slow. (the second innings will give a clearer picture). Saud Shakeel used the paddle shot over the wicket keeper to get a four off Axar Patel. A boundary after 32 balls. It was a no-boundary phase between overs 15.1 and 24.2. Even during the chase against New Zealand, Pakistan’s policy was to save wickets but the acceleration came only from Khushdil Shah’s 69 off 49. Both Rizwan and Shakeel struggled to do the basics right – knocking the ball around in the gaps to take singles and twos. They got into odd positions, perhaps giving too much respect to certain deliveries, without getting to the pitch of the ball to dig themselves into a hole. Any attempt at improvisation was half-hearted. After a steady start, the two wickets of Babar Azam and Imam-ul-haq, put the brakes on the Pakistan innings. But Rizwan and Shakeel pulled the hand brake and decided to go nowhere. Even when they timed the ball well, they had a knack of finding the fielders. Block-by-block the two Pakistan batsmen played into India’s hands. Rizwan is a busy player, like wicketkeepers Pakistan produce, but on Sunday his many movements at the crease didn’t result in big shots. Will this first-gear phase hurt Pakistan?
– Nihal Koshie
Middle overs, slumberous surface, batsmen in mood for building the innings forward rather than blazing boundaries, a medium pacer needs to plough deep into his cricketing wisdom to poach a wicket. Hardik Pandya, his knack of setting-up batsmen less celebrated, psychoanalysed Saud Shakeel and hung a clever ruse. Saud is an instinctive puller of the ball and backs himself to take on the fielder. Unlike some of his Asian brethren, he goes really back in the crease and swivels his body to get the control and placement. So when Hardik went short, the third ball of the 33rd over, he imperiously pulled him towards the fence. The next ball was slow, short of length and outside the off-stump which he thudded to point for no runs. The next though was the heavier short ball, not on his body as last time, but outside the off-stump. So far used to the un-distressing pace of Hardik, he pulled him without any hesitation. The ball came quicker, got a tad big on him, and he mistimed the ball to deep midwicket’s grasp. While at first sight, it seemed like the batsman’s indiscretion, in reality it was a clever seamer cleverly entrapping a set batsman.

The way things are going, Pakistan and its players don’t seem likely to win too many awards in this tournament, but if there’s an award for the worst DRS challenge, Shaheen Shah Afridi would be in the running. Batsmen often find it difficult to believe they are out, but Afridi took it to another level. Coming to the wicket in the 43rd over after Agha Salman’s dismissal, the left-hander was rapped on the pads by Kuldeep Yadav on the first ball itself. Umpire Richard Illingworth wasted little time in raising his finger and Afridi almost immediately made the ‘T’ with his hands. His conviction, for a moment. made some wonder whether he had got an edge to the ball or it was spinning too much to miss leg-stump. The first replay showed that the bat had missed the ball by the width of two stumps. Afridi was hit on off-stump when he played back to a full delivery with the ball turning in to hit the middle of middle stump. That Pakistan had two reviews in the bank may have prompted Afridi to go upstairs, but the replays weren’t a good look for him.

IND vs PAK: For the second consecutive game, an Indian bowler missed a hat-trick. This time, it was Kuldeep Yadav who was on a hat-trick but could not get the wicket of Naseem Shah after dismissing Salman Agha (19) and Shaheen Shah Afridi (0) on the previous deliveries.

On the final ball of his over, Kuldeep had a hat-trick chance and managed to extract a faint edge from newcomer Naseem Shah, but the ball did not carry to second slip. The miss notwithstanding, India were already in the driver’s seat in the Group A game against Pakistan, reducing the team to 200/7.

Shaheen Shah Afridi also wasted one of Pakistan’s reviews by referring the LBW decision against Kuldeep. The replays showed that there was no doubt that Shaheen was out LBW.

In the Men in Blue’s opening game against Bangladesh, Axar Patel was on a hat-trick after picking up the wickets of Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim. He managed to induce an edge from Jaker Ali, but Rohit Sharma dropped the catch on first slip. Jaker went on to score 68 runs for Bangladesh.
The game against the Men in Blue is a must-win for hosts and defending champion Pakistan, who lost their opener against New Zealand. Only two teams make it to the semis-finals from each four-team group. With India having refused to come to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, the game is being played at the Dubai International Stadium. India are the only team who will play all their games in Dubai while the rest of the seven teams are playing most of their games in Pakistan under the hybrid model of hosting.

Former Pakistan skipper and wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed believes that Indian superstars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should be allowed to decide their future in international cricket.

Both Rohit and Virat have been under the scanner following consecutive test series loss against New Zealand and Australia. Their place has been questioned in the red ball cricket with both batters struggling to get the runs. “People should not even talk about Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Their performances have been outstanding for India,” Ahmed told reporters here on Sunday.

“Virat Kohli has won those matches for India, and I have seen it with my own eyes, you can’t imagine, the kind of performances he has produced for India. The same goes for Rohit Sharma. The way he is leading the team. He led the team outstandingly in the 2023 (ODI) World Cup and won the T20 World Cup,” he added further.

Sarfaraz believes that both the players have the right to say their goodbyes to the sport when they think is the right time and India should build a team around them till then. “Let them play and let them decide what they want to do. You should make your team around them. The way they bid adieu to T20Is, they will do it for other formats when they feel it is time. You should not make a team by removing them, you should make teams by including them,” he said.
Sarfaraz Ahmed, the last Pakistan skipper to win an ICC tournament, is part of the commentary team in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

The beginning of 2024 was not a good one for Hardik Pandya with the allrounder being roundly booed by fans in the Indian Premier League after he was declared the captain of Mumbai Indians in place of Rohit Sharma. But as the year went on, Pandya turned his fortunes around after his match-winning performances in India’s T20 World Cup winning triumph.
“They (fans) said, life for me, had come a full circle. They said, from here on, there was no looking back. I had won them (fans) back,” said Pandya in a video posted by the BCCI on social media.
Pandya scored 144 runs and took 11 wickets in the global tournament as India reclaimed the T20 World Cup after 2007, ending India’s 13-year long ICC Trophy drought.

“A new year, a new tournament and a new challenge awaits us. Our quest to become champions once again has begun. Today, we step out yet again to start fresh, to conquer another day, to conquer another opponent. Chapter 2 in the Champions Trophy awaits. Get ready and fasten your seat-belts for a contest that needs no introduction,” he said before India’s Champions Trophy match against Pakistan on Sunday.
In the Pakistan match on Sunday, Hardik was in top form sending back Babar Azam and a well-set Saud Shakeel. Shakeel was looking ominous with 62 runs but he tried to pull Pandya’s delivery only to end up holing out to Axar Patel in the deep.

In the first match against Bangladesh, Pandya bowled a miserly four overs, giving away just 20 runs without taking a wicket as India won by six wickets.

Shami’s over is the longest by an Indian in the Champions Trophy and the second-longest ever in the tournament. Shami’s 11-ball over surpassed Jasprit Bumrah’s nine-ball over, incidentally also against Pakistan in their last meeting during the Champions Trophy final at the Oval in 2017.

Shami bowled four wides in the over and also faced a discomfort in the Dubai heat before heading back to the dugout after the over for a change of shoes. Returning to bowl his third over, Shami was seen grimacing and clutching his ankle/calf area with the physio running out to have a look. Conceding only three runs in the over, Shami immediately walked off the field into the dressing room at the end of five overs with Pakistan moving up to 25 for no loss.

Shami, who is on the comeback trail from his long injury lay-off, picked up a five-wicket haul in the previous outing against Bangladesh in Dubai. Shami followed Ravindra Jadeja as the second India to claim a five-for in the Champions Trophy and also became the quickest bowler (in terms of balls bowled) to reach 200 ODI wickets.
In Shami’s absence, all-rounder Hardik Pandya replaced the veteran seamer in the attack alongside Harshit Rana. Shami later returned to the field after the 11th over, immediately starting his second spell.

Recently, his wife Sanjana Ganesan, who works with ICC, gave an update about Bumrah’s injury. “He is okay. He is training at the NCA,” Sanjana said when Bangladeshi player Mehdi Hasan Miraz questioned her about Bumrah during a shoot.
India will be against arch-rivals Pakistan in the second group game of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. It is a must-win game for Pakistan after losing the opening game to New Zealand while India will be looking to solidify their position into the semi-finals with a second win in a row after defeating Bangladesh in their opening fixture.

Venkata reported: “The two throw-down specialists of India, who seem to have come separately, were been waiting in the middle for a while. The Indian team finally got here just about 35 minutes before the toss… Given the chock-a-block traffic one expected the stadium to fill up fast. But it is not even 25 per cent full as yet (one hour before the game). Don’t expect a full house when the first ball is bowled.”

He added: “The temperature is increasing, which means there is a possibility of dew later on. Shubman Gill is standing behind the stumps and is visualising some shots. Varun Chakaravarthy and Washington Sundar are bowling in the practice pitch with Gautam Gambhir and Rohit Sharma keeping a close eye.”

Title: ‘For such an incredible team as India, they haven’t really won too many trophies’ – Mudassar Nazar

While admitting that Pakistan can’t run away from the fact that they have been playing in poor form, their batting consultant Mudassar Nazar said, the India-Pakistan match will be even because India hasn’t quite done justice to their “incredible strength” converting them to trophies.
India vs Pakistan Match LIVE Cricket Score Online Updates: Watch Here
Speaking to RevSportz on the eve of the match, Nazar roped in by Pakistan coach Aquib Javed to bolster their batting, was blunt. “Agar aap India ki strength dekhe, itni zabardast team hai, toh uss hisaab se itni trophies jeete bhi nahi. Major title jeete nai. Haarke chale jaate hai. Ekaadh jeeta hai bas,” he said, adding that he was being told for the 11th time that Pakistan performance was poor, giving India the advantage.
IND vs PAK LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
There’s no doubt that Pakistan performance hasn’t been great. And form isn’t good going into the match. And Indian performance has been better. But if you look at India’s strengths and compare it to number of trophies, it isn’t much,” he noted in the RevSportz interview. “They’ve not really won many trophies, they lose and go home. Maybe one odd trophy they’ve won,” he assessed.
India vs Pakistan LIVE Cricket Match Streaming Online: Watch Here
Nazar was peeved at being reminded that Pakistan were struggling, but reminded with a chuckle that it was a new game. “Some 10 Indian journalists have told me that Pakistan will lose. What is so new about Pakistan losing? They’ve lost before. These matches are do or die, whoever plays well on the day, wins.”
He calmed down to tell RevSportz, “This will be a fighting match, even match and let’s hope it’s a good match.”
He added that Pakistan couldn’t run away from their wretched form. “I can’t deny our form has been poor. Ranking bejaar hai. We can’t run away from that fact. But this is a different game. So it’s not a foregone conclusion that Pakistan will lose easily to India. But it will be a good match.”
When asked what Pakistan needed to do, he told RevSportz, “Chadhke khelna hoga, itraana nahi hai. Agar koi achha khel raha hai toh khadaa rehna hoga. (Have to step up and play proactive cricket. If someone is playing well, they have to stay long),” he said.
Nazar admitted that there was a bowling concern for Pakistan. “Major problem for Pakistan bowling is they are not getting reverse swing,” he said. On Shaheen Afridi, he noted, “more than zip, swing is important. I’m sure he’s making adjustments.”
When asked why Babar has been shuffled about from No 3 to opening, Nazar shot back saying, “So what’s wrong? Your best player shouldn’t have a problem. These pitches suit him.”
Nazar was also quoted on indyalive, as saying, “India is a formidable team. Hopefully, Pakistan will play up to its potential and try to reverse these results. If Pakistan raises the bar tomorrow, they can put on a grand show. Conditions are not that different. Playing here against India is a different thing altogether. India has all the bases covered.”
The former batting great said India left arm all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, could be crucial. “They have Jadeja, one of the greatest all-rounders. This surface will suit him in both batting and bowling. There is no denying the fact that India poses a great threat to Pakistan. But whoever handles the pressure better will thrive,” Nazar added.

Australia’s record-breaking run-chase to kick-start their Champions Trophy campaign at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore has somewhat flattened England as they suffered a fourth successive ODI defeat on Saturday since the recent India tour earlier this month.

Motoring on wicket-keeper Josh Inglis’ blistering century, Australia romped past a 352-run target to record the highest chase in Champions Trophy history, despite entering the tournament with a depleted squad. Inglis’ maiden ODI hundred had him finish on 120 not out off 86 balls with Australia cleaning up the chase with 15 balls to spare.

With captain Steve Smith opting to field first, England put on a comprehensive batting display led by opener Ben Duckett’s 143-ball 165, the highest individual score in the tournament. However, both Duckett and England skipper Jos Buttler rued the dewy conditions that hampered their defense.
“A fantastic game, both sides played well, credit to Australia,” Buttler said. “It was a fantastic innings from Inglis. 350 is a pretty good score, but it was wet and the dew was a worry.”
“I probably would have batted first. It’s 50/50 whether the dew comes in or not, we’ll look to make good use of the surface,” he said after the toss.
“We’re not trying to hide anything, we’re confident in the set-up. The guys seem in a good place and anytime you play Australia it’s a big event.”
Duckett also highlighted the wet conditions as a pivotal factor in deciding the game.
“First of all, when a side chases down 350 you’ve got to give them credit. I think they played really well in those middle overs,” Duckett told Sky Sports. To be honest it felt like we were one, two wickets away from potentially winning pretty easily. I couldn’t always, while we were fielding, see the lines we were bowling, but it felt like we cut a little bit too much on that wicket.
“The one thing I spoke about was keeping the stumps in play. You only have to walk across here to see it. It did get easier. The back end of our innings it felt impossible to stand there and try and hit sixes. When Jos and Livvy (Liam Livingstone) and those guys came in. The conditions obviously changed,” Duckett added.

Eight years after they beat India in the 2017 Champions Trophy final, Pakistan’s campaign at home suffered a huge dent when they lost to New Zealand by 60 runs in the opener. Meanwhile, India thumped Bangladesh in Dubai to get a head-start in the four-team group, two of whom will qualify for the semi-finals.

However, with an Indian win over Pakistan on Sunday likely to diffuse any further excitement over results in the group, former India seamer Atul Wassan has backed the neighbours to spring a surprise and light up the Champions Trophy.
“I want Pakistan to win. Maza aayega (it will be fun, tournament-wise). If you don’t let Pakistan win, then what will you do? If Pakistan wins, then it becomes a contest. There should be an equal fight,” Wassan, who played nine ODIs and four Tests, told ANI.
While Pakistan defeated India in a T20 during the 2021 World Cup at Dubai International Cricket Stadium, they have not secured an ODI win across six meetings since the 2017 Champions Trophy final.
Rohit Sharma’s team blew away Pakistan in their league-stage match at the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad, shortly after beating them twice in the Asia Cup that year.

India have gotten the better of Pakistan in the last two ICC events with the Men in Blue defeating their archrivals in the 2024 T20 World Cup as well as the 2023 ODI World Cup. With more familiarity to the Dubai conditions, the Rohit Sharma-led squad can be considered the favourites heading into Sunday’s match.

The pitch is expected to be sluggish as the day wears on with the India batters training hard the day before to counter the spinners. Early on, the surface will be conducive for batting as well as pace bowling with the seamers finding purchase on the surface. The ball will tend to turn in the middle overs and assist the tweakers. The batters will have an advantage earlier in the match but the nature of the surface does not always result in a high scoring match.

The weather during in India Pakistan match is expected to be pretty hot with AccuWeather suggesting 33 degrees in the afternoon. The temperature will drop down to 26 degrees in the evening but the conditions are expected to be cloudy and warm.

The lead-up to the tournament was dominated by who was missing from the squad rather than who was in it. But again they showed that whatever XI takes the park in the famous yellow jersey, it still provides a formidable challenge. Chasing 352, they lost their proven match-winners in Travis Head and Steve Smith, but it was their less-heralded players like Matthew Short and Alex Short, and the under-fire Marnus Labuschagne, who made vital contributions while Josh Inglis played one of the greatest ODI innings in a big chase. The fact that they overhauled the target with 15 balls left proved that when the Aussies get on a roll, they are ruthless in putting down their opponents.

Even while fielding, they pegged England back from a situation where they looked to be heading to a score of at least 380. They hung in there and even without their first-choice pace attack, did whatever was needed to give their batsmen a chance.

Getting more than 350 batting first means the batting side was taken care of, even though they would feel that they should have got a few more. Ben Duckett could have done with better support from the lower-middle order. Apart from him and Joe Root (68), nobody else got to 25.

They have bowlers with pace but on a really flat wicket and dew setting in, they needed a bit more nous and variety. After the first few overs, they only possessed Adil Rashid as a genuine wicket-taking option. Jofra Archer has just returned from a long injury layoff and seemed devoid of confidence after getting hit around a bit. When a partnership is well entrenched, the bowlers don’t seem to be making much impact. Jos Buttler wasn’t an inspiring captain at the 2023 World Cup, and is not doing the job either with the bat or as a leader. Bazball has still to show any tangible results.

After a quiet start to the tournament in Dubai, the India-Pakistan game is generating great excitement.
There is a downside though – the cheapest ticket for a seat in the 30,000-seater Dubai International Stadium costs Rs 12,000 or 500 dirhams. For the lucky few, an Indian businessman is a saviour. Anis Sajan, the vice-chairman of the Danube Group, used a lucky draw to distribute 100 match tickets as a Ramadan gift to his blue-collar workforce, majority of them from India and Pakistan. He has also organised a special screening for those who missed out on the free tickets.
“Cricket is more than just a sport. It is an emotion that unites people across borders. Many of our blue-collar workers are devoted cricket fans, but the high ticket prices and overwhelming demand make attending a live match a distant dream. Watching their cricketing idols live in action will be an unforgettable experience for them,” Sajan said.
With nearly 3.7 million Indians and 1.7 million Pakistanis in the UAE, demand for tickets has gone through the roof.
Sajan is not the only business tycoon giving tickets as gifts to cricket-obsessed employees.
“We always get gifts from our owners during Ramadan. This time, since we got to know in advance that the match is happening here, our bosses have gifted match tickets for the game. If not, there was no way we would have been able to buy tickets,” Rakesh, who works in the hospitality industry in Dubai, said.
A cinema chain is screening the game ‘live’ and malls are reportedly facing a staff crunch on Sunday as leave applications have piled up.
For ‘hosts’ Pakistan, the game in Dubai is a do-or-die one after their loss in the opener against New Zealand. After waiting for nearly three decades to host an ICC event, Mohammad Rizwan’s team is staring at an early exit. None less than the Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reminded the players of the high stakes involved. “…the real task now is to not only win the Champions Trophy but also defeat our arch rival,” he weighed in earlier this month.
What’s guaranteed is a full house at the Dubai International Stadium with all roads leading to the Sports City – roads are set to be closed for security reasons from 9 am for a 1 pm start.
Sharjah, 46 minutes away by road, was the spiritual home away from home for India-Pakistan cricket in the 1980s and 90s, but those in Dubai will hope for a modern classic despite the evident gulf in class between the sides in the 50-over game.
In ODIs in Dubai, India, 2023 World Cup finalists, have won both the previous games against Pakistan, while in T20Is, the latter has won two out of three meetings.
The players didn’t meet each other on match eve. India trained at the ICC Academy while Pakistan at the Dubai Stadium. To avoid any possible tension between fan groups, the local Indian and Pakistani communities have decided to hold separate screenings.
On the eve of the game, in-form batsman Shubman Gill was asked if games between the two sides were over-hyped. “India-Pakistan has a long history. It’s an exciting contest when both these teams play. Everyone enjoys watching it. If so many people are happy to watch the match, who are we to say that it is under-hyped or over-hyped? We go there to play cricket,” he said. “I think it is a big match, but I think the biggest match would obviously be the final that the team plays,” he said.
Pakistan coach Aaqib Javed acknowledged the importance of the match if Pakistan are to stay alive in the tournament.
“There is no game which you play without pressure. We lost to New Zealand, which has a good balance. We still have a chance to qualify. Against India, it doesn’t matter if it is a must- win or not. All of our players are waiting to raise the bar,” Javed said.
India, despite being without strike bowler Jasprit Bumrah, and with an out-of-form Virat Kohli, will have the edge going into the match. Whichever way the result goes, fans will be hoping for a modern classic in Dubai.

India-Pakistan games aren’t for the faint hearted. That’s why Playing XI decisions for these matches are not just taken by just considering the skills of players. Temperament too is a factor. Injuries and form are the reasons the two teams will be forced to make changes. The Indian Express argues for the inclusion of Arshdeep Singh, Mohammad Hasnain and Imam-ul-Haq for the Champions Trophy clash between the great rivals.

The Indian team management will be dealing with a pace-dilemma before the toss. Arshdeep Singh or Harshit Rana is not an easy choice since they are contrastingly different bowlers. Conditions and opposition is a factor but both Arshdeep and Harshit will have a challenge at hand when bowling against the Pakistan batsmen in Dubai. Rana was excellent against Bangladesh, where the Delhi pacer registered his best ODI figures 3 for 31. But India would love to bring in Arshdeep Singh, who has the ability to move the new ball. Arshdeep has made a habit of producing rippers like the Babar Azam’s wicket in his first-ever World Cup (2022) delivery for instance. In the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy, Arshdeep was the leading wicket taker with 20 wickets.

Pakistan’s bid to defend their Champions Trophy title has suffered a major setback as opening batter Fakhar Zaman has been ruled out for the remainder of the tournament due to an oblique injury. Imam, 29, who has represented Pakistan in 72 One-Day Internationals (ODIs), was named as Fakhar’s replacement after the approval from ICC technical committee. Fakhar Zaman was forced to leave the field just two deliveries into the match against New Zealand on Wednesday, after suffering a muscular injury while fielding. He had chased a ball toward the boundary, stopped it, and then threw it to Babar Azam, but immediately appeared to feel discomfort. Zaman walked off the field with the physio, although he did so unaided, and later returned to the field. While batting, he continued to feel discomfort and was checked again by the physio. He struggled to run between the wickets and was eventually dismissed for 24 off 42 deliveries by Bracewell.
The highly impressive Pakistan pace department in this Champions Trophy has been injury prone. The adversity has helped the team showcase its depth. Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah has been injury prone. With only spinner in their rank Pakistan captain Moammad Rizwan has two options: Express pacer and proud member of the 150 kph Club Mohammad Hasnain or old hand Faheem Ashraf. Pakistan can also go with a four-prong pace attack, Hasnain would be opening the bowling attack with Shaheen. If that happens, leave aside everything and watch the first 10 overs of Pakistan innings. Express Pak pacers vs World Class Indian Top 3 will be a face-off to relish.
India predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami
Pakistan predicted XI: Babar Azam, Imam-ul-Haq, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (C & WK), Salman Ali Agha, Tayyab Tahir, Khushdil Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed/Mohammad Hasnain

Title: It’s beyond a game, that’s the beauty of India-Pakistan cricket, says Pakistan coach Aaqib Javed

If one thought Pakistan coming to Dubai could ease the pressure of them playing in front of home fans, in a must-win contest against India, their head coach Aaqib Javed seemed more intent on treating Sunday’s clash as ‘beyond a game’. He wouldn’t stop there, and even claimed: ‘If you remove this pressure, what’s left in the Pakistan-India game? Passion and pressure is what is needed to show a player his performance.”

Already facing pressure of expectations of doing well in the first ICC event they are hosting in 29 years, they go into the game against India with the added pressure of this being a must-win fixture.

“There is no game you can say you play without pressure. The first game we lost, okay. New Zealand is a very strong team. They have good balance… After losing a game there is another good chance for you to win here and win the third one and make it to the semis. It is India and Pakistan. It doesn’t matter if it is a knockout or whatever. It’s beyond a game and that’s the beauty of India-Pakistan cricket. And if you look at the positive, I think that is the best time and best chance for any individual or a team to make a mark,” Javed, who has been part of several Indo-Pak classics in Sharjah, said.
With high stakes, Pakistan called on their former player and coach Mudassar Nazar to pass on his inputs. Nazar, who resides in Dubai, and has been instrumental in the development of several players in their squad during his time as the head of their cricket academy, oversaw the two practice sessions alongside Javed. “At Dubai, India will start favourites because of the support. These conditions are not new to Pakistan, it was all about just giving confidence with your inputs. Back home, every player is an expert and has an opinion which adds to the pressure. Here, they can still beat India,” Nazar said.
And just as they were wrapping up their training session, former players Wahab Riaz and Mohammed Hafeez would pay a visit to the middle. A little later, the PCB Chair Mohsin Naqvi, who is also their interior minister, would also drop in.
What is evident is how far Pakistan have fallen off the perch in ODIs, a format they used to dominate in the 80s and 90s. Apart from the dwindling batting talent, their fitness and fielding levels have been a throwback to a different era. “If you ask me, 50 over cricket has become more challenging. After 35-40 overs, you have to improve your fitness level. If you focus on T20 matches the entire year — you don’t go beyond 30 overs. So, I think fitness is the biggest challenge,” Javed said.

Their biggest issue remains with their batting and whom they will turn to for inspiration. The batting, other than Fakhar Zaman, has lost the firepower at the top, with Imam-ul-Haq summoned out of a red-ball tournament to join the squad. If not Imam, they could hand a cap to Usman Khan, their reserve wicketkeeper in the squad. Their premier batsman Babar Azam is reeling under pressure which leaves it to the middle-order that comprises of Muhammad Rizwan, Salman Agha and Khushdil Shah to carry their batting.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Australia find an Inglis hero in record chase against England
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-australia-josh-inglis-vs-england-record-chase-9850836/
Content:
It has not been a lengthy international career till date but there was a graphic on broadcast towards the end of his match-winning innings that showed Josh Inglis scores nearly two-thirds of his ODI runs in the region between point and midwicket. So it was fitting that he went from 86 to 104 with three sixes in that segment of the Gaddafi Stadium. When Brydon Carse changed his pace and hit a hard length, the ball sat up for Inglis to smash one over square leg. The very next ball, out came the scoop to a length ball on off-stump, flinging it over third man for a maximum. And in the next over, another change of pace delivery, this from Jofra Archer, Inglis pulled in front of square for a massive six to reach his century. The England-born Inglis’ unbeaten 120* off 86 balls led Australia to a stunning five-wicket win against England in Lahore on Saturday, chasing down 352 with 15 balls to spare.
England had their chance though. Last ball of the 38th over, with Jos Buttler hoping for a breakthrough from his main man Adil Rashid, Alex Carey went hard with a slog-pull. The ball went straight to Archer at deep midwicket and the England pacer put it down, and had his hands on the head. On a day Carey produced magic on the field without his gloves on – taking two stunning outfield catches – the catch that was dropped off his bat was a costly moment. Archer came on to bowl the next over and conceded two boundaries off the first two balls, rubbing salt into England’s collective wounds. It was around this time that the win predictor on broadcast swung in Australia’s favour. When Carey and Inglis had begun their partnership, that number stood at over 80 percent in favour of England.
In Inglis and Carey, Australia picked two in-form batters in their XI, though they typically compete for one spot. And it paid dividends as the duo put on a match-changing 146-run partnership off just 116 balls to overhaul England’s 351/8.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
The scorecard will say that England had the highest individual score on the night – in fact, the highest individual score in the history of the ICC Champions Trophy – Ben Duckett’s 165 off 143 balls. England had the highest partnership too with Duckett and Root adding 158 for the third wicket. But what Australia had was a clear target in front of them, a good understanding of the conditions with dew settling late on, and a calculated deconstruction of England’s bowling plans where they saw off Rashid and the two part-time spin options with minimal damage and went after the pace bowlers.
At the 30-over mark, England were 200/2 while Australia were a bit behind on 197/4. The traditional ODI formula is to double that score in the remaining 20 overs if there are wickets in hand. But Adam Zampa removed Root and Harry Brook in quick succession to put a spanner in England’s progress.
Between overs 31-40, both teams scored 68 runs but England lost two wickets where Australia lost none. England also suffered another setback as they looked to launch in the last 10 where Jos Buttler had a critical role to play. After a steady start, he started to push the pedal in the 41st over with a six and four off Glenn Maxwell. But the England captain got out off the last ball of that over, looked down on the pitch and punched it with his right glove in frustration.
Another one of those game-changing moments, it was perhaps the difference between 375 and 350 as England fell well short of doubling their 30-over tally.
Earlier in the day, Duckett showed the hunger for scoring big runs (something that came under criticism during England’s abject series defeat in India recently) to give England a chance. After Phil Salt was left stunned by a spectacular catch at mid-on by Carey, and was soon followed to the dressing by Jamie Smith, Duckett and Root went about steadying the ship. The run rate didn’t drop too much while the two built a solid base. But it wasn’t enough.

“You’d take 350 at the start,” Buttler said after the match. On most days, such a total would have been sufficient. After all, 350+ wasn’t ever chased down in the history of ICC ODI events before Saturday. But Australia – without three of their talismanic pacers and with minimal contributions from their two experienced batters in Steve Smith and Travis Head – showed why they are made for the big stage.

Title: Champions Trophy: Australia complete highest successful run chase in all ICC tournaments, defeat England by 5 wickets
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-australia-highest-successful-run-chase-icc-eng-9850762/

Josh Inglis scored a blistering century as Australia completed the highest successful run chase in all ICC tournaments when they defeated England by 5 wickets at Lahore on Saturday in the Champions Trophy. Along with Inglis, opener Matthew Short scored a 66-ball 63, Alex Carey scored 69 while Glenn Maxwell chipped in with a quickfire 32 runs.
England who were sitting comfortable after they got rid of Travis Head and Steve Smith but Inglis’s knock came out of the syllabus as the Australian player stayed unbeaten at 120, playing 86 deliveries in an innings peppered with 6 sixes and 8 fours.
Earlier, Ben Duckett struck a magnificent career-best 165 to power England to 351 for 8 against Australia in their Champions Trophy Group B opening match.
The 30-year-old Duckett, who was benched during England’s disastrous T20 World Cup campaign last year, grabbed his moment on the big stage, hitting 17 boundaries and three sixes during his 143-ball knock to lead his side to their highest ever total in the Champions Trophy.
England, after being sent in to bat, were in early trouble at 43/2 inside the powerplay, but Duckett stood tall, first stitching a 158-run stand with Joe Root (68) and later forging a crucial 61-run partnership with skipper Jos Buttler (23 off 21 balls).
After his dismissal in the 48th over, Jofra Archer smashed two fours and one six in his 10-ball 21 not out to prop up the total past 350-mark.
Duckett’s innings was meticulously planned, blending patience with aggression.
He started confidently, taking on Glenn Maxwell with a charge-down six in just the second over, setting the tone for England’s recovery.
Once settled, he rotated strike fluently with Root, allowing the innings to flow, before shifting gears in the latter half.
Duckett brought up his century off 95 balls with back-to-back boundaries off Spencer Johnson, marking his second ODI ton against Australia.
The depleted Australian side struggled as their frontline spinner Adam Zampa was hit by Duckett all around the park.
Even as left-arm pacer Ben Dwarshuis (3/66) took two wickets up front, their pace attack looked listless without the troika of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood who were ruled out with injuries.

Nathan Ellis was the pick of the lot as he was excellent with his line and length even as he returned wicketless (0/51 from 10 overs).

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Kohli against spin, countering sluggish surface, middle-overs gameplan the focus as India prepare to take on Pakistan

After a convincing win over Bangladesh in their opening fixture, there was a sense of purpose and direction in how India went about their preparations on the eve of their big-ticket match against Pakistan on Sunday. Given an off-day on Friday, some of them used the time to watch movies, while a few of them went for dinners. But at the ICC Academy ground on Saturday, they turned up an hour early for the training session that was officially scheduled to start at 1 pm.

Matches against Pakistan often bring some additional drama. But not this time. If anything, this team appeared oblivious to it, instead focusing on the job at hand. There was no talk of this being a special game or the desperate need to do well to win over the fans. Instead, they are looking inward. India may have brushed aside Bangladesh, but there are a few screws waiting to be tightened before this becomes the well-oiled machine one saw at the 2023 50-over World Cup.

With the first match giving clear indication about the conditions in Dubai over the next fortnight, India definitely have work to do in terms of their game against the spinners and batting in the middle overs on slow decks. Their splendid run at the World Cup was, after all, undone on a similarly slow surface in Ahmedabad, which India could possibly face again as the tournament progresses. Though they played on a fresh pitch on Thursday, the square already appears a tired one. With Dubai moving on from winter to spring, the rising temperatures could bring spinners more into play.

Before coming into the ICC Champions Trophy, India had played only 9 ODIs since the World Cup and Shubman Gill said they are still adjusting to the format.
“The format of 50-over cricket is such that we feel that we have less time and have to take on the game. But when a batsman gets out, he realises that he actually had a lot of time. We don’t get to play as many matches in this format as we play T20s and Test matches. So, I think it’s very important that whatever decision you are taking, you take it with a very balanced mind. And you should definitely check the scoreboard once if you are trying to take an extra risk. But generally, as a batsman, it is our instinct to follow a tempo and keep playing according to it,” Gull said.
As a result India, instead of reacting, are already being proactive. Leading the way was Virat Kohli, whose recent struggles against spinners are well documented. He has been dismissed by tweakers in the last 6 ODIs – five to leggies and once to a left-arm spinner. Even against Bangladesh before he fell to Rishad Hossain, he struggled for flow and on Saturday, was the first to arrive for the net session, a good two hours before the scheduled start.
He walked in with batting coach Sitanshu Kotak and throwdown specialists Raghu and Seneviratne. After taking a few throwdowns, he faced three local net bowlers – an off-spinner, a leg-spinner and a left-arm spinner – for the next couple of hours. With batting in the middle overs likely to be a grind, he didn’t focus as much on freeing his arms, instead was more intent on getting to the pitch of the ball. Once his teammates joined him at the academy, Kohli would face the quicks before taking a breather.
But very soon, with India’s lower order having a net session, he would once again get down to taking throwdowns, trying to sharpen his drives. He would start off by having a fielder stationed at mid-off before making him move towards the point region and then behind square in an attempt to find the gap. Once that session ended, Kohli would get to the nets again.
If Kohli’s homework was all about facing the tweakers, the middle order comprising Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja went about their work in different ways. Last year in Sri Lanka, in similar conditions, they ended up losing all three matches in the middle overs, as the application of the batsmen repeatedly came under the scanner. On such pitches, the middle order, instead of combining caution with aggression, just tried to hit their way out of trouble, with not much success.
So Shreyas, Axar and Rahul alternated between playing risk-free shots and big hits through the line. However, when the pacers came on, there was urgency with regards to the intent they want to display in the game. Time and again, Rahul and Pandya would clear the front leg and target the mid-wicket boundary off short-of-good- length balls, which Haris Rauf usually employs in the middle overs.

If one goes by their preparation, where they oozed calmness and confidence, India appear ready for Pakistan’s challenge.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Ben Duckett adapts and resists to put on ODI masterclass
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ben-duckett-masterclass-century-100-eng-vs-aus-9850653/
Content:
Ben Duckett isn’t an orthodox opener who accesses conventional areas of the field for his boundaries. However, he is no less effective as Australia found out as his 165 off just 142 deliveries took England to their highest score in ICC Champions Trophy history. Staying on the backfoot, cutting and flicking against pace while playing sweeps and reverse-sweeps to the tweakers is the 30-year-old’s gameplan.
“Ben played hockey and rugby, as well as cricket, from a young age at Winchester House Prep School and throughout his time at Stowe. In hockey, he was a great exponent of reverse-hitting the ball and could already play the reverse-sweep and switch-hit when he arrived at Stowe,” James Knott, Duckett’s coach during his school days, told The Indian Express.
To Duckett, sweeps and reverse-sweeps are like Rohit Sharma’s pull shot or Virat Kohli’s cover drive. But back in 2016 when he made his international debut, he did struggle against spin. Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin made him dance to his tunes on fairly docile surfaces when England toured India. The left-hander would be dropped from the team post that series.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
“He came to the school for a session not long after he got back. His confidence was hit and he needed to get that back. It took time to return, but he has always been at his best when taking the attacking option,” Knott would say. “In 2016, I was with the Lions at the time we were on tour in UAE, and watching him there it felt just like he was too young and it was too early for him,” another of Duckett’s coaches, Julian Wood would recall.
Duckett had to go back to domestic cricket and do it all over again. While he had decent seasons for Nottinghamshire, it wasn’t until 2022 that he had a breakthrough year in First-Class cricket when he managed to score 1,012 runs at an average of 72.28, returning to the England set-up when Brendon McCullum took over as the head coach of the Test team which was in tatters at the time.
When the 2019 50-over world champions and 2022 T20 World Cup winners slid in their fortunes, McCullum was given the reins of the white-ball teams as well.
England’s all-guns-blazing approach has not reaped the same rewards under Jos Buttler as they did under Eoin Morgan. There were instances during the 2023 ODI World Cup and even the recent series in India when it turned counterproductive.
Duckett is one of the better players of spin in the England team alongside Joe Root. During the ODI series against India, if he got through the Powerplay, he continued to play in the fifth gear even when the field was spread out. His wicket would prompt a collapse. While the likes of Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone and Jos Buttler can be brutal on their day, their ability to play spin and manoeuvre the ball in the middle overs is not as fluent as Duckett or Root.
This is where Duckett’s innings on Saturday was significant for England. He did play his aggressive shots but did pick and choose his moments to do so. Australia did not feed him deliveries which he could play square of the wicket with the new ball, nor did the spinners bowl the length where he could play his cheeky sweeps. But the opener waited for his moment. He would curb his instinct to hit a fuller-length ball to cow corner or square-leg and would instead look for a single.

Australia were operating with only four frontline bowlers with Glenn Maxwell, Mathew Short, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschange to fill the fifth bowler’s quota. As soon as one of these would come into the attack, Duckett would target them with his trademark shots.

Title: Sanjay Manjrekar says it’s unlikely that Rohit Sharma will be there in the 2027 World Cup
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sanjay-manjrekar-rohit-sharma-unlikely-to-play-2027-world-cup-9850609/
Content:
Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar said that it was very unlikely that current India skipper Rohit Sharma will stick around for the 2027 World Cup. Manjrekar also suggested that the ongoing Champions Trophy might be the last international tournament that Rohit takes part in.
“I have a feeling (that) if he has decided, I mean can Rohit Sharma be there for the 2027 Cricket World Cup? I don’t think so, very unlikely. So, then, this could be, what you are suggesting, could be the final tournament,” said Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo’s Matchday programme.
“I’m expecting Rohit Sharma to go out there and he should be actually liberated not so much by this being his sort of swansong or whatever, just by the fact that so much of quality batting to come (from him),” added Manjrekar.
Rohit has started the Champions Trophy with a dominant 41 runs against Bangladesh and notched up a 69-run partnership with vice captain Shubman Gill. Before that, he came back to form with a century against England in the recently-concluded ODI series after a tough few months where he struggled for runs in the Australia and new Zealand Test series.
“2023 World Cup (in India) Rohit Sharma’s popularity soared. What they loved about Rohit Sharma is that they saw the captain was selfless, went out there… (he) could have got a hundred but (instead) gave a great flying start to the team and made things easier for the players coming after him,” said Manjrekar.

Rohit will next be in action as India take on Pakistan in the Champions Trophy on Sunday.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘I don’t think vice captaincy has changed anything’: Shubman Gill
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-shubman-gill-india-pakistan-vice-captaincy-9850501/
Content:
India vice-captain Shubman Gill on Saturday said that the added responsibilities as Rohit Sharma’s deputy hasn’t really affected on how he plays the 50-over format. Gill, who slammed a century in India’s Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh on Thursday, has been in a rich vein of form in the 50-over format, having scored a century as well as two fifties against England in the series preceding the Champions Trophy.
“I don’t think vice captaincy has changed anything. When I’m batting out there, I want to still play as a batsman because I feel that’s when – or that’s what brings the best out of me. So, whenever I’m batting out there, I’m just playing however I would play, irrespective of if I’m the vice-captain or not,” Gill said in the pre-match press conference before the match against Pakistan.
Gill also talked about the hype that is created whenever these two arch-rivals meet, saying that they’ll treat the match as any other contest.
“It’s not for me to say whether India-Pakistan contest is under-hyped or over-hyped. There is a long history of India-Pakistan cricket. It is a very exciting contest but it doesn’t change anything for us.
“It is an important but the most important match will be the final,” Gill said.
Dew played a big role when the T20 World Cup was held in the UAE and Gill said it impacts the game even more in the ODI format. However, the lack of dew here has made batting tougher under lights on what is a challenging surface anyway.
“In the last match, dew was not there. When dew is not there, it is not that easy to bat (under lights) and it is not that easy to rotate strike as well. Whoever does well in middle overs has a better chance of winning. With lack of dew, toss also doesn’t play a big role.

“But, for any team – in any big match, if we don’t get dew then the team that is batting later will have more pressure,” said the stylish opener.

Title: ‘Babar never tried to build up bench strength due to his likes and dislikes’: Umar Akmal slams former PAK captain
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/umral-akmal-slams-babar-azam-inability-bench-strength-pak-9850423/
Content:
Former Pakistan batter Umar Akmal became the latest person to slam Babar Azam after Pakistan made a disappointing start to their Champions Trophy campaign with a loss to New Zealand. Akmal, who hasn’t played for the national side since 2019, said that Babar had failed to build Pakistan’s bench strength during his stint as skipper.
“Babar was captain for nearly five years most of the time in all formats and he never tried to build up the bench strength due to his likes and dislikes,” Umar told a TV channel.
Akmal also stated that he had approached Babar for a chance to make his comeback to the national side but his request was swiftly rejected.
“I told Babar that look give me a fair chance. You are doing well in the top order and I can be your finisher and we can win matches regularly and it will be good for Pakistan cricket,” he said.
“He didn’t listen to me and for five years when he was captain he never bothered to try to build a strong bench because only teams with good back up players do consistently well in all formats,” he added.
Babar served as Pakistan’s captain from late 2019 until late 2023 before stepping down following the 2023 World Cup. He was reinstated as captain in 2024 for white-ball formats but relinquished the role after a disappointing World T20 Cup campaign last year.

Umar, who is Babar’s cousin, represented Pakistan in 16 Tests, 121 ODIs, and 84 T20Is before being dropped from the national team in 2019. He stated that the Pakistan team has stagnated because talented players, who have performed consistently in domestic cricket, have not been given a fair chance under Babar’s leadership.

Title: Amanjot Kaur relishes match-winning turnaround for Mumbai Indians: Hard work, resilience, and god’s plans
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/amanjot-kaur-match-winner-mumbai-indians-wpl-hard-work-9850375/
Content:
With 24 needed off 17 balls in the cauldron that was the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Mumbai Indians lost the wicket of Harmanpreet Kaur. A run-chase that seemed well within MI’s grasp was suddenly starting to slip away as the lower order was left to finish the job. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru fans were roaring once more. On her way back, the MI captain took a minute to chat briefly with her partner, Amanjot Kaur. “Harman di just told me, ‘If you stay out there, you’ll be able to do it easily’. And I told her, ‘I’ll do it for you, don’t worry’,” the younger Kaur revealed later.
And so, with 22 runs needed off 12 balls, Amanjot smashed two sixes in the 19th over that dragged MI back into the match and eventually, across the finish line as 16-year-old G Kamalini held her nerve in the last over. It was the day Amanjot had been waiting for a long time – to be a match-winner for Mumbai Indians with both bat and ball. She did just that against RCB with her 3/22 that included wickets of Richa Ghosh and Ellyse Perry and 34* off 27. It came after a testing 2024 due to injuries that have seen her slide out of India’s squad after making a bright start to her international career.
“Those six to eight months were very crucial for me. Blessed and grateful for that phase to have come in my life,” Amanjot said after the match. “Two people must have cried today, tears of happiness, I mean. Nagesh sir and Tanuja ma’am (personal coach and trainer). They were with me throughout those 6-8 months. They were just waiting for me to get back on the field. Nagesh sir hadn’t seen me bowl for a while. It must have been a big day for him too. They’ll have a good night’s sleep today.”
Actually, Nagesh Gupta couldn’t catch a wink. “It felt so great watching Amanjot Kaur win the match for Mumbai Indians with the bat and all. So happy that I couldn’t sleep last night,” coach Nagesh Gupta told The Indian Express. “I listened to the press conference and she said we would have slept well, par hum so nahi paaye ji, excitement itna raha.” (I couldn’t sleep, the excitement was too much.)
To get to this point hasn’t been easy for Amanjot. The story goes that her cricketing journey began when her father Bhupinder Singh, literally, decided to take things into his own hands. When she was excluded from a game of gully cricket by a group of boys with the excuse that she didn’t have her own bat, she told her father about it. Bhupinder, a carpenter by trade, went to his shop later in the evening, carved her a bat, and left it on her bed.
And just when things were looking up, destiny had other plans. In January 2023, things were looking rosy for Amanjot. On the back of strong domestic displays, she made her T20I debut in South Africa and in her first outing for India, won the player of the match award. She made her ODI debut later that year too.
But in 2024, she missed large chunks of the season due to a back stress fracture and a hand ligament injury. Initially, it was tough to come to terms with. A feeling of ‘why did this happen to me’ because, as Nagesh said, Amanjot is a naturally gifted athlete who had always been proud of her fitness. “I have never taken fitness lightly. I am not a foodie, so I don’t like eating out. I really like to go to the gym. So, I never expected that I would get injuries like these, so I troubled my coach and trainer a lot for the first two weeks,” Amanjot said, recalling the initial stress.
Nagesh concurred. “She felt like ‘everyone else is playing and I am not playing. And that too because of injury.’ The biggest challenge is how to remain motivated. During that time, I talked to her daily, exchanging messages. The first two weeks were difficult but after that, she realised she had the time focus on other areas. Rather than crying about injuries, we should take this as a challenge. The things that we can add, we can learn. On a daily basis, I used to tell her to try to learn a life skill or a cricket skill. That way you will grow as a human being and as a player when you come back from an injury.”
Amanjot said conversing with other Indian players playing in the NCA during rehab also helped her. “There were a lot of cricketers at the NCA, so speaking to them helped. Guys like Riyan Parag, Khaleel Ahmed, and Surya bhai was here as well. I would watch their discussions and that helped me a lot.”

Nagesh said, “She has been with me since 2016. To be honest, I haven’t seen a more eager and hardworking student than her. Always first to come and last to leave training. She learned a lot in the period she was injured. As she herself said, she has come closer to god, she prays a lot, and she has learned about humility. These qualities are also very important to become a good player. To become a good person.”
Indeed, at the end of her post-match chat, Amanjot looked up. “God’s plans are always greater than ours.”

Title: Champions Trophy: India’s National Anthem plays in Lahore briefly before the start of ‘Advance Australia Fair’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-indias-national-anthem-plays-in-lahore-briefly-before-the-start-of-advance-australia-fair-9850289/
Content:
There was an audio gaffe at the ICC Champions Trophy on Saturday before the start of the age-old rivalry between Australia and England at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Between the two national anthems that were played, India’s ‘Jana Gana Mana’ was heard on the broadcast for a brief moment. In the pause between ‘God Save The King’ and ‘Advance Australia Fair’, the Indian national anthem played, was stopped immediately even as the fans in the stadium seemed to have realised something was off, then the Australian anthem started.
“Well we got there in the end after a false start with the Australian national anthem,” former England captain Michael Atherton said on air as the teams started dispersing after the anthems, evidently referring to the gaffe.
India, of course, are not playing in Pakistan over diplomatic tensions. The eight-team event has returned for the first time since the last edition was staged in 2017, with defending champions Pakistan hosting their first global cricket tournament since 1996. But with BCCI not wanting to visit Pakistan, UAE was confirmed as the neutral venue where India will play all their matches. Lahore is scheduled to host the final on 9 March, however, if India qualifies for the final it will be played in Dubai.
In another controversy, the Pakistan Cricket Board is reportedly not pleased by the fact that “Pakistan” was left out of the broadcast during India’s opener against Bangladesh, according to ESPNCricinfo. PCB has asked for an explanation from ICC as the logo that is displayed on the top left corner of the broadcast left out the host country’s name during India vs Bangladesh, but it has been featured during other matches. The ICC have said it was a technical glitch as per the report.
Australia skipper Steve Smith won the toss and elected to bowl against England in their opening match. The reigning world champions drafted in in-form wicketkeeper batter Alex Carey in the middle-order, despite having another stumper in Josh Inglis. England had named their playing XI well in advance, with Jamie Smith taking the gloves and slotted to bat at No 3.

Title: Sunil Gavaskar pinpoints Virat Kohli’s technical flaws against spinners
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-pinpoints-virat-kohlis-technical-flaws-against-spinners-9850248/
Content:
One of the major concerns for the Indian cricket team in the recent past has been the recurring dismissals of ace batter Virat Kohli.
As the team prepares to regain the Champions Trophy after 12 years, the dismissal of Virat in the same manner time and again due to an open-faced bat has left everyone worried and frustrated, including legendary Sunil Gavaskar.
“It is to a great extent due to the fact that the bat face opens up, the same thing happens when he’s playing against the quicks in Australia,” Gavaskar told India Today.
In the opening game of the Champions Trophy 2025 against Bangladesh, Kohli got out to wrist-spinner Rishad Hossain while he was caught by Soumya Sarkar at the backward point trying to cut the ball. This marks the sixth consecutive time Kohli has been dismissed by spin in ODIs, as he had struggled against England’s leg-spinner Adil Rashid too in the recent home series.
“The bat face is opening up, looking to play through the covers, opening the face of the bat, that gets him into trouble. So that is something that he’s got to watch out for,” Gavaskar explained. “A couple of times before he got out, he reached for Rishad, the ball turned, the bat face opened, and luckily the bat face opened, and so there was no nick. So that is something that he’ll have to tighten up on now.”
Kohli scored a fifty in the last ODI against England before the Champions Trophy but got out for a sluggish 22 against Bangladesh.
“If you’re getting out to the same kind of bowling, then you know, there is a bit of concern,” Gavaskar said.
Kohli, who scored 765 runs in 11 matches during the 2023 ODI World Cup, has struggled to replicate that form this year, managing only 137 runs in six innings at an average of 22.83, with just one half-century. In Tests since 2024, he has scored only 440 runs in 11 matches.

The sub-continental rivals’ last Champion Trophy clash was the 2017 final in which Pakistan walked away with the win and the trophy. Rizwan and Co. would look to draw inspiration from that triumph in London but would also need to scale up their performance in every department. Pakistan would also be hoping to prove a point by getting the better of India, who refused to travel across the border for the tournament which is otherwise wholly scheduled in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.

It is looking like the India vs Pakistan cricket match in Dubai, will not be heavily impacted by rain. The weather is looking to be warm, and mostly dry. There’s a very low probability of rain, with reports showing around a 1% chance. Daytime temperatures are expected to reach around the low 30s°C. Evening temperatures will likely drop to the low 20s°C. There might be some cloud cover, but it’s not expected to disrupt the match.
The pitch is generally considered to be one that can offer assistance to both batsmen and bowlers, though it can vary. As the game progresses, especially in day/night matches, spinners can become more effective due to the surface tending to dry out. Early on, fast bowlers may find some swing and bounce. The average first innings score indicates that while runs can be scored, it’s not always a consistently high-scoring venue. Spinners tend to play a significant role, especially in the middle overs, as the pitch can offer turn. Fast bowlers can utilize the new ball for swing and bounce. Dew can be a factor in day/night matches, potentially influencing the decision of which team bats first.

Title: Rahul Dravid plays with his son Anvay in a club match

Content:
He may be 52 years old, but former India coach Rahul Dravid has shown that his love for playing the sport hasn’t diminished a bit, teaming up with his younger son Anvay (16) in a Sri Nassur Memorial Shield 3rd division game.
Playing for Vijaya Cricket Club (Malur), their team was put into bat after losing the toss against Young Lions Club and scored 345-7 in 50 overs.
Anvay scoring fiery 58 off 60 balls while Dravid sr only managed 10 runs off eight balls.
Swapnil Yelave scored 107 to give his team a fighting total.
Surely Dravid’s presence in the dressing room is bound to motivate the youngsters in the team.
Both Dravid’s sons have taken up to their father and are flourishing in their game.
Anvay, a wicketkeeper-batsman like his father, was the top run-getter in the Vijay Merchant Trophy 2023-24 for the state. He made 357 runs from five matches at an average of 45 with four fifties in the under-16 tournament. He was also the highest run-scorer in the under-14 state league tournament while playing for Vijaya Cricket Club.
Anvay’s elder brother, Samit, also represented Karnataka successfully in age-group tournaments for Karnataka over the years.
In September last year, Samit was named in the India Under-19 team for a series against Australia U19 at home. He, however, could not feature throughout the series after suffering a knee injury.
Like Anvay, Samit too has been among the runs and wickets. In the Cooch Behar Trophy last year, he made 362 runs and took 16 wickets in eight matches during Karnataka’s title-winning campaign.

Content:
Mohammed Shami’s five-wicket haul against Bangladesh in India’s opening match in the Champions Trophy shows just how much India missed him during their recent Test series loss against New Zealand and Australia, respectively.
The 34-year-old, who is still far from his best, picked up wickets with the new ball and then came back to break the dangerous-looking 154-run partnership for the sixth between Towhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali. The standout feature of Shami’s bowling was his trademark upright seam. His nip-backers were sharp, his outswinger deadly, and he repeatedly beat the outside edge with balls zipping around the fourth and fifth stumps.
In an interview with Star Sports, the speedster revealed how much weight he has lost get back into the Indian dressing room.
While interviewing Shami, former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu asked: “The most difficult job is get off from the debt and losing weight and you have lost 5 to 6 kg weight.”
Shami interrupted Sidhu and said: “Paaji 9 kg giraya hai (I have lost nine kgs).
Shami also opened up about his struggle during the rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and love for Biryani.
“The most difficult thing is that you challenge yourself. When I was at the NCA, my weight was close to 90 kg,” he said.
“Sabse achi cheez kya hai ki meri zubaan jyada chatpati nahi hai (I don’t have this cravings of eating unhealthy food). I stay away from the sweets.
“And since you are talking about Biryani. Yaar kabhi kabhi cheat meal chalta hai (Once in a while you can have that cheat meal,” he laughed.
Mohammad Shami revealed how in the past ten years, he only takes one meal per day.
“Since 2015 I only eat once in a day. I have skipped breakfast and lunch all these years. I only eat dinner. Its a difficult thing to do but once you get used to it then its easy.,” he said.

Title: Shubman Gill deserves to be the No. 1 ranked batsman in the world: Ricky Ponting
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shubman-gill-deserves-to-be-the-no-1-ranked-batsman-in-the-world-ricky-ponting-9850020/
Content:
Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting has said India’s sensational batter Shubman Gill surely deserves to be at the top of ICC ODI batting rankings.
On Wednesday, Gill dethroned Pakistan’s Babar Azam from the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings. In the latest rankings list, Gill has 796 rating points while Babar has 773. India skipper Rohit Sharma is ranked third with 761 points. South Africa’s Henrich Klaasen and New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell at fourth and fifth respectively.
Gill’s dominance in ODIs has been highly praised and he lived up to the expectations in India’s Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh where he scored a a match-winning century (101*). It was also his fourth successive 50+ score, making him one of the most persistent batters.
Ponting said Gill’s rise to the No.1 ranking is commendable and deserving. “He thoroughly deserves to be the number one ranked batsman in the world at the moment. It’s a great sign for India that he’s got his account underway early in the first game of a Champions Trophy,” Ponting shared on ICC Review podcast.
Ponting also acknowledged Gill’s presence in limited-overs cricket, even though he struggled to showcase his white-ball success in Test cricket. “He’s been a very, very good international player for several years. His white-ball cricket over the last three or four years has been outstanding,” he said.
The World Cup-winning skipper also pointed out why Gill’s style of game is ODI cricket. “One-day cricket allows him to be aggressive early in the powerplay with the field up. He plays good, natural shots and scores boundaries at will,” he added.
Gill has accumulated a massive 2,688 runs in 51 ODIs with an average of 62.51, which includes eight centuries.
The next clash where India is set to play against Pakistan on 23 February in the Dubai International Stadium is a game to surely watch out for.

Title: Basit Ali takes a jibe on Pakistan’s cricket team and economy: ‘Ab TV bhi nahi tootenge…’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/basit-ali-takes-a-jibe-on-pakistans-cricket-team-and-economy-ab-tv-bhi-nahi-tootenge-9849929/
Content:
Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has made a scathing attack on Pakistan’s national cricket team and country’s economy ahead of their must-win game against India in the ongoing Champions Trophy. Pakistan will face their arch-rivals India at the International Cricket Stadium in Dubai on Sunday.
“Agar one-sided hota hai, toh ab TV bhi nahi tootenge kyunki Pakistan mei mehangai bahut zyada hai. Ab zabaan se hi har cheez hogi (If Pakistan will lose one-sided against India, now the fans will not thrash their TV sets because of country’s economic situation. Now there will be only voiced opinion,” Basit Ali, who has played 19 Tests and 50 ODIs for Pakistan said on his Youtube Channel.
Basit Ali also admits if Pakistan will manage to beat India in Dubai then it will be a big upset.
“India are favourites. There is no doubt about that. In my opinion, if Pakistan manage to beat India, it will be an upset because our cricket has gone down and is at all time low,” he said.
Basit Ali pointed out the issues in the current Pakistan squad picked for the Champions Trophy.
“Who will bat at No 3, nobody knows. They might ask Usman Khan to open with Imam and bring Babar Azam at No 3,” he said.
“Fakhar Zaman is out. Now Pakistan’s batting line-up from number one to five similar. If there car is running in the third gear, then it will stay in the third gear. ut won’t be able to switch into turbo mode in the last five or 10 overs,” he added.
India have won their first match against Bangladesh by six wickets in Dubai. Meanwhile, Pakistan the defending champions and hosts lost their opening match against New Zealand by 60 runs in Karachi.
“Pakistan should now play cricket with bat and brain, not with the mouth,” said Basit.
The 54-year-old also took a sly dig on Pakistan Cricket Board’s effort to renovate the stadiums instead of building a strong team.
“The amount of money they spent in building the stadiums, they could have built a good team in half of that amount.
“But to build a team you need intelligence. What is your vision? What’s your thinking? How do you view a player’s talent? These are the important things.”

Title: AUS vs ENG: What to expect from 22-yard strip at Gaddafi Stadium

Content:
Winners of the last two ODI World Cups, Australia and England, square off in their opening encounter at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Saturday.
The batting paradise that awaits both teams at the Gaddafi Stadium will be a welcome sight for both teams, who might be low on confidence coming into the Champions Trophy. England lost the three-match ODI series to India while Australia were also blanked by Sri Lanka in Colombo in a short series of two games.
Ahead of the AUS vs ENG clash on Saturday, here’s the pitch report and the weather update for the Group B game in the Champions Trophy:
Gaddafi Stadium’s pitch has traditionally been a batter’s paradise. In the recently-concluded ODI tri-series between Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa, matches at the venue showed the challenge that bowlers will have to overcome. High scores were common in those games, with teams like New Zealand and Pakistan blasting bowling attacks to post totals over 300. The Australia vs England match could also be a high-scoring affair, especially if England bat first given Australia’s depleted pace bowling attack that is missing the likes of Pat Cummins (injured), Josh Hazlewood (injured), Mitchell Starc (personal reasons) and Marcus Stoinis (retired).
The weather forecast for Karachi for the Australia vs England game indicates that it’s likely to be a clear day with no rain predicted. The temperature is set to be in the early 20s in the first half of the game. After the sunset, the temperature is set to hover between 15-20 degrees Celsius.

Title: India vs Pakistan: No war, no shooting; just fight to be Miandad, Joginder, not Chetan Sharma, Misbah
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-no-war-no-shooting-just-fight-to-be-miandad-joginder-not-chetan-sharma-misbah-9849648/
Content:
However hard the TV broadcasters try to beat the war drums, India vs Pakistan cricket, these days, is anything but ‘war minus the shooting’. However hard the billboard artists try to photoshop Rohit Sharma and Mohammad Rizwan to make them appear menacing, the two naturally congenial captains still can’t pass off as ruthless generals leading bloodthirsty armies.
That old narrative promoting cricket’s most storied derby has got boring and inaccurate but, somehow it has survived. The caricaturing of this high-stakes sporting contest needs to stop. Indo-Pak cricket needs to be saved from the marketers who seem hell-bent on reducing this many-layered rivalry into a one-dimensional cliché.
It is these unimaginative war references that justify the mixing of sports and politics and the slamming of the cricket door between the two neighbours, whose players famously get along and whose fans have never waged pitched battles in the stands.
This Sunday, India and Pakistan will meet again and those familiar voices are on air again. Netflix has timed the airing of its documentary ‘The Greatest Rivalry’ with the ICC Champions Trophy’s showcase game. Its promo video has visuals of tanks blasting shells on the border and lung-busting cries by high-on-aggro guards at the Wagah ceremony every evening.

JioHotstar flashes images of a Pakistan player with a bloodied face. It also has scary close-ups of angry fans with war paint on their faces. Even MS Dhoni is seen extolling fans to sledge. How long can Javed Miandad mimicking Kiran More’s jumping-jack routine be interpreted as some Kargil-like confrontation? Well, it has been more than 30 years but Miandad is still leaping on the screen. Have a heart, he is 67 now.
Why has it taken the world so long to realise that the arenas where these storied Blue vs Green games are played aren’t battlefields but theatres of dreams. These sporting face-offs are chess over 22 yards, exhibition of exquisite cricketing skills and an opportunity for players to be permanently housed in the memories of fans.
Nothing inspires a sportsman more than a packed house and a chance to make a lasting impression on those who have invested in them.
On such days, runs and wickets carry more weight and value. These are the games where legends are made and myths shaped. These are the contests that give teams and players their identity that get pasted on memories for years and sometime for ever. Most times unfairly.
Take two much-discussed Indo-Pak finals – the 1986 Austral-Asia Cup and the 2007 ICC World T20. Miandad, the manipulator of strike with an expert at nicking singles, is remembered as a six-hitting finisher. Chetan Sharma, with a World Cup hundred and hat-trick to his name, can’t get the ‘last ball full-toss’ albatross off his neck.
History will see Joginder Sharma, a man with a very modest international record, as a nerveless bowler. As for Misbah-ul-Haq, the highly skillful batsman blessed with a calm cricketing mind, he carries on his back forever the ‘brain fade’ monkey. This is what India-Pakistan games are all about and that’s why the pressure.
So India might have sailed past Bangladesh and Pakistan might have rolled over without a fight against New Zealand in their opening games, but only the naive would get into predicting the result of the most-watched game of the tournament.
It’s the attention of the millions of eye-balls that makes even untested players do extraordinary feats on days when streets go empty in the sub-continent. Go to the Indo-Pak cricket archives to find out why Manzoor Elahi or Saleem Yousuf still get free lunches in Pakistan for the match-winning 50s they scored against India or why Atul Bedade still gets asked about the four sixes he hit in a Sharjah game which India lost. This is why the newbies – Pakistan’s Salman Agha, Khushdil Shah, Abrar Ahmed or India’s Harshit Rana – will fancy their chances to scoop the perks on offer at the Dubai game.
Even a single magical stroke or a dream ball can get tagged to a cricketer forever. Virat Kohli’s backfoot six down the ground, Sachin Tendulkar’s stunning upper cut, Mohammad Amir’s cutter, Shaheen Afridi’s in-swinger … they are still shared on WhatsApp groups of cricket fans. This Sunday, Kohli, Rohit, Babar Azam, Rizwan would want immortality in winning games.
Over the years, the changing trends in India-Pakistan cricket results would go a long way in how the world perceived them. These games were the markers that decided the collective psyche and character of the two teams. So around the mid- 1980s – post Miandad’s and subsequently Elahi’s match-winning efforts – Pakistan was seen as a team with a chip on the shoulder and a firm belief that they could get the better of India regardless of the match situation. Pakistan were called aggressive, India mild-mannered and nervy. The latter lost to Pakistan on Fridays and at Sharjah – India banked on this pessimism to make peace with their serial defeats.
The wheels would move with time. The 90s brought about a change. That was the time when war and regional geo-politics would see the snapping of ties between India and Pakistan. Sharjah would get boycotted and ICC events would be the meeting stage for the two teams. The decade would expose Pakistan cricket’s ugly belly. Their top cricketers would have match-fixing stains on them. Political uncertainty would further impact the game.
The last two ICC events – 2023 World Cup, 2024 T20 World Cup – show that the shoe is now on the other foot. It is Pakistan that suffers from an inferiority complex. Now India has the confidence to turn any game. They didn’t let the pressure of winning overwhelm them in front of over a lakh spectators at the Narendra Modi Stadium and at New York’s Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, they performed a Houdini act in the final overs.
This sporting pattern isn’t quite unique to Pakistan. Other teams too have been in this terrible place. But this isn’t a dead end. Back in the day, Manchester City was a no-hoper team in the English league when neighbours Man United ruled. Losses in big games and their frequent acts of ‘snatching defeat from jaws of victory’ would be received by a familiar groan of ‘typical City’. It was a chronic disorder that was given a name – City-itis.
These days, ‘typical Pakistan” is often heard on the international cricket circuit. This Sunday, they have a chance to cure Pakistanitis. But India wouldn’t oblige. This is no war, no shooting, just an engrossing sporting contest where two proud cricketing nations play to preserve their legacy. This is a more civilised theme which has potential to revive sporting ties that the war-monger tribe has snapped.

Title: Champions Trophy: Yuvraj Singh believes Pakistan have an edge in India vs Pakistan clash

After both India and Pakistan have played their opening games in the Champions Trophy, it would not be absurd to think of Team India as the favourites. Rohit Sharma’s men, after all, brushed aside Bangladesh in their opening game by six wickets while Pakistan lost to New Zealand by 60 runs at home.
Making matters more complex for the defending champions is the fact that the big game on Sunday will be played in Dubai, where India have already played one game while Pakistan, who are technically the hosts of the tournament, will be visitors at the stadium.
Their defeat to New Zealand means that Pakistan need to win their game against India if they want to keep their hopes of qualifying for the semis alive.
But Yuvraj Singh believes that Pakistan are the team which will have an edge on Sunday when India confront Pakistan.
“I actually think Pakistan has an advantage because they have a base in Dubai. They have played a lot of cricket there and understand the conditions well,” Yuvraj said on JioHotstar for a special show in the build up to the India vs Pakistan game.

On the same show, Shahid Afridi also said that “India has more matchwinners than Pakistan”.
“On slower wickets, Indian and Pakistani players are among the best, who have always played spin well. You talk about match-winners. Yes, I agree with Shahid Afridi that we have more match-winners. But I believe that even if Pakistan has fewer match-winners, one player can still take the game away. The India-Pakistan clash is not about match-winners alone; it’s about playing in the moment, adapting to the situation, and not letting expectations overwhelm you. The team that does this better will win the game for their country,” Yuvraj added.

Title: AUS vs ENG: Marnus Labuschagne gets recall; Jamie Smith to bat at No 3
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-2025-aus-vs-eng-predicted-playing-11-marnus-labuschagne-jamie-smith-9849426/
Content:
It’s rare for a team to announce their playing XI for a game two days in advance. But that’s just what England did ahead of their Champions Trophy opener against Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.
The playing XI did reveal that wicketkeeper Jamie Smith will be tasked with batting at No. 3 for the first time in his international career. England captain Jos Buttler explained the reasoning behind Smith’s elevation. “We just feel it’s a nice position to give him a free hit to try and really impact the game, make that that top three really dynamic. Jamie’s someone with incredible talent and taken to international cricket so well that we feel he’s got the game there and can place him in that position to try and have a really big impact with a number of guys behind him,” he said.
Since he helped Australia break Indian hearts in the final of the Cricket World Cup in Ahmedabad, Marnus Labuschagne has been below par. He has averaged just 23.28 in ODIs since the start of 2024. In the recently played two-game ODI series against Sri Lanka, he did not play in the second ODI while scoring just 15 off 27 balls in the first. Australia were thrashed in both games ion Colombo by a team that did not even make the cut for the Champions Trophy. But the Australian think tank is expected to hand Labuschagne a chance to redeem himself against old rivals England.
While many teams have been hurt by injuries coming into the Champions Trophy, there is no side that has been affected as severely as Australia. The 50-over world champions are missing pacers of the calibre of captain Pat Cummins (injured), Josh Hazlewood (injured) and Mitchell Starc (personal reasons) besides Mitchell Marsh (injured) and Marcus Stoinis (retired from ODIs).

Title: Champions Trophy first impressions: Solid South Africa; shaky Afghanistan
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-first-impressions-solid-south-africa-shaky-afghanistan-9849416/
Content:
If South Africa didn’t enter the tournament as favourites, the pitiless dismembering of Afghanistan showed they are sturdy enough to mount a serious title challenge. Afghanistan, on the other hand, were toothless and without the personnel and wisdom of chasing down 300-plus totals in this format.
A few doubts lingered about South Africa. Is Ryan Rickelton a worthy heir of Quinton de Kock? Can David Miller alone inject death-over impetus in the (injury-enforced) absence of Heinrich Klaassen? How fit and sharp is Kagiso Rabada? The Proteas found encouraging answers to every question that lurked over them.
Rickelton crunched a hundred of skill and power. Miller did not fire, but Aidem Markram reminded the world of his big-hitting dimensions during a splendid 36-ball 52. Rabada bowled with fire and precision. Nothing exemplified it more than the 148 kph thunderbolt he unleashed to hammer the stumps of Ibrahim Zadran, the ball after he was smeared for a maximum. He hit stifling lengths, extracted steep bounce from a dead track and hustled batsmen. Rabada, a rejuvenated Lungi Ngidi, the nippy Marco Jansen, the crafty Wiaan Mulder and the wise Keshav Maharaj could inflict wounds on better batting line-ups than Afghanistan’s.
The curve is crawling upwards and it would definitely scale higher heights, but Afghanistan have a few stones to turn over before they become a genuinely dangerous side. Chasing big totals continues to unnerve them; their approach is muddled, caught up between all-out attack and wicket preservation for the death-over dance. They end up doing neither, and are consigned to playing catch up cricket for much of the innings. The new-ball spell lacked penetration, the seamers erred on the shorter side, and a genuine quick was severely missed. The spin trio of Rashid Khan, Mohammed Nabi and Noor Ahmed is their biggest strength, but when good batsmen foil them with expert foot work and dizzying power, they need a plan B to nab wickets. More than anything, their lack of depth in this format was exposed. They could indeed plot an upset, but are from being dark horses, let alone semifinal aspirants.

Title: Babar Azam’s sluggish strike-rates pit him in stark contrast to creative Virat Kohli
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/babar-azam-sluggish-strike-rates-stark-contrast-creative-virat-kohli-9849399/
Content:
On Friday as Babar Azam made his entry into the ICC Academy here, he did so with a grim face, appearing a bit lost. Not even young kids chanting his name would brighten the mood nor the sight of some familiar faces at the academy whom he just greeted with a customary handshake. Back home, since the defeat against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy opener, there is no player in this Pakistan team who is under as much pressure as Babar whose 90-ball 64 in the chase of 321 had made him a national villain of sorts. Be it sports shows or prime time news or YouTube channels, Babar’s strike-rate and intent still remain the hot topic of debate.
Over the next couple of days, as an all-important showdown with India awaits on Sunday, which is now a must-win fixture for Pakistan to stay alive in the tournament, more eyes will undoubtedly be on Babar. For a team that is missing Saim Ayub and lost Fakhar Zaman to injury in the opener, Babar was supposed to be the lifeline of this Pakistan batting. Instead, as he laboured his way to a torturous 64 with Kiwi spinners pinning him on the crease, he is now facing a crisis that he hasn’t faced before. Talks around Babar’s strike-rate aren’t new. Despite occupying the top spot in ODI rankings, he has often been accused of being a ‘stat-padder’. But now these questions are beginning to grow louder, with Babar giving space to questions as to whether this is more to do with his ability or his over-cautious approach – which has long vanished from white-ball cricket – that is holding him back from showing intent, which modern day batting is all about.
In a chase of 300-plus, one of the top three in the line-up choosing to drop anchor and bat long isn’t new. It is a method that even India routinely adapts where in most cases their No 3 Virat Kohli plays that anchor role, taking the calculated risks and others providing the impetus. Of course, given Pakistan’s brittle batting, there is every reason for their most experienced batsman and one considered as the best of this era to bat more responsibly by putting a price on his wicket.
However, unlike Kohli where Babar has been going wrong is how he lets the intent go missing. So far in his career Kohli has been striking at 93.43, whereas Babar is going at 87.91. And in chases it gets even worse. Having made a name for himself as an ODI great, by virtue of his ability to close out games while chasing, Kohli has a strike-rate of still 93.37. With Babar it goes down to 85.26 which means it invariably puts more pressure on other batsmen to take more risks. Against New Zealand, it is what happened with Salman Agha and Khushdil Shah who had no choice but to take more risks.
There was a reason why the likes of Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner, and Glenn Phillips managed to tie down Babar, as they even bowled with the mid-off fielder inside the ring. Unlike Kohli, who he is often compared with, Babar’s batting to an extent lacks the imagination of modern day batsmen. The sweep is absent in his batting. So it’s the drives and the nudges that keep the scoreboard ticking. Instead, the two off-spinners usually considered a favourite match-up for right-handed batsmen, managed to keep him quiet by having a fielder at square-leg and one at mid-off.
Speaking on the show Dressing Room on Ten Sports, former India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara, who faced plenty of questions about his lack of intent in Test cricket, decoded where Babar is going wrong. “When the spinners are operating, you should use the paddle-sweep or reverse-sweep – it need not be forceful, just a paddle, because what it does is, you are opening up a new pocket to get runs. And the fielder at square-leg would then move to 45. Similarly, when you face the spinners (with mid-off up) you have to use your feet regularly, and when you do so, you are not letting the bowler bowl where he wants,” Pujara would say.
And at Dubai, after being aloof in the squad for a while, Babar would walk to the furthermost net, away from all the lensmen. For the next 20 odd minutes, he would take throwdowns, repeatedly playing the drives and the back-foot square drive until he felt satisfied. Former Pakistan player and noted coach Mudassar Nazar, who was watching it all unfold would then have a brief conversation with Babar before he moved to a different net where the spinners were operating.
With India having an army of spinners and the pitch in Dubai on the slower side, another innings devoid of intent from Babar would play into the hands of Rohit Sharma’s men. Perhaps with that in mind, Babar would attempt a few paddle sweeps often to deliveries that were too full – a clear sign of desperation. Not the most powerful of batsman, at the nets he tried to come down the track and play the chip shots over mid-wicket and covers. And when he stepped out of the crease, there were instances of him failing to make a connection as well. Was it because of lack of confidence or was it down to ability was anybody’s guess.
However, one thing is certain. The lack of intent in Babar’s batting would not just weigh him down but also drag Pakistan with it.

Title: Ranji Trophy: How guests Jalaj Saxena, Aditya Sarvate worked in tandem to take Kerala to an unprecedented summit clash
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-how-guests-jalaj-saxena-aditya-sarvate-worked-in-tandem-to-take-kerala-to-an-unprecedented-summit-clash-9849378/
Content:
Jalaj Saxena’s First-Class debut came two days after his 19th birthday in December 2005 against Kerala in his hometown Indore. He would meet them again the next year in Palakkad in his third appearance, alongside Amay Khurasiya, the only India international in the Madhya Pradesh XI then.
In a twist of cricketing fate a staggering 149 matches into his red-ball career, the 38-year-old Saxena would see his dream of a Ranji Trophy final realised with Kerala on Friday – nine years after he left his home state – with head coach Khurasiya in his first season in charge of the side.
Nagpur-born Aditya Sarvate’s only two meetings against Kerala ended in victories. Part of the Vidarbha side that wiped out Kerala in their only two knockout meetings – the Ranji quarterfinal in 2016-17 and the semi-final in Wayanad in 2018-19 – Sarvate even claimed a match-winning six-wicket haul in the first meeting in Surat. After his third unsuccessful Ranji final last year, the 35-year-old Sarvate secured a fourth appearance in the summit clash alongside Saxena and Khurasiya for Kerala, versus his original home team.
For knockout amateurs Kerala, the strategy was clear from the moment captain Sachin Baby announced their playing XI for the Ranji semi-final against Gujarat in Ahmedabad. Even as national selector Ajay Ratra heaped praise on the acutely cautious Kerala management for bravely fielding two debutants in Varun Nayanar and Ahammed Imran to shore up the batting on a strip they expected to turn square quite early, Saxena and Sarvate had to show up with the ball. There was no Plan B for a four-man bowling attack fielding two domestic stalwarts.
“Jalajum Sarvateyum ith nammalku erinju pidichirikkum (Jalaj and Sarvate will bowl them out and win it for us),” Kerala manager Nasir Machan, a veteran of nearly 33 years of cricket in the state, said before the start of play on Day 1.
After a colossal battle of patience on a flat deck to raise 457, Kerala’s hopes seemed to be receding when Gujarat sped to 222 for one in 71 overs, scoring at a much higher rate. Saxena and Sarvate were thwarted and wicketless on Day 3, with Gujarat’s batting bulwark Priyank Panchal denying them the rough and angles at every step with a flawless 29th First-Class hundred.

For the evergreen Saxena, a Ranji Trophy final would be the absolute reward for all the toil over 20 years with the India call-up seemingly a distant dream. Kick-starting the Kerala comeback, mustering all his nous and off-spin wizardry, Saxena finished with four massive scalps that shut the Gujarat top order on Thursday. That was before a marathon haul of 27 consecutive overs would bog Saxena down with Sarvate losing his lengths against Gujarat’s lower order bats Jaymeet Patel and Siddharth Desai.
On Friday, Sarvate would receive a shot in the arm when a shrewd Machan pulled the right chords before play. “Adi, we need to go to your hometown tomorrow. Nagpur. We need to face Vidarbha in the final,” the 59-year-old told the veteran spinner with a straight face.
With only a stringent budget of 28 runs and three wickets to get in the decisive play, Saxena and Sarvate orchestrated a masterclass, valuing the presence of one another to exploit the footmarks at one end while targeting the left-right pairs in Gujarat’s tail.
As Saxena tightened the screws with the longest bowling innings (71-14-149-4) of his career, Sarvate (45.4-7-111-4) would miraculously conjure up the three magical deliveries that would let his partner and new team soak in a new high.
“It’s a feeling which I cannot express in words. I’ve always been dreaming of this moment and fortunately, it’s happening for me. I can’t express my happiness,” said Saxena as his phenomenal First-Class tally rose to 7,032 runs and 482 wickets.
With over 2,000-plus runs and 300-plus wickets, left-arm spinner Sarvate has revelled in the circuit all right. But he is content playing second fiddle this time, behind the ‘G.O.A.T.’
“He (Jalaj) has been playing for 20 years. So, I am no one in front of him. You can call him a G.O.A.T., 7,000 runs and 450 wickets is no small deal. I just try to be in his presence and try asking him about match situations and conditions. I am also learning from him a lot and he has been a great guide for me too,” Sarvate remarked.
The Kerala think tank was instrumental in pairing up the two probing spin arms in the bid for a historic final this season. “It was really emotional for me to leave Vidarbha after 10 years and come to a new place. But from day one, I didn’t feel like an outsider here. The players and the coaching staff and even Amay sir have been treating me exceptionally well,” said Sarvate.
“As a professional cricketer, it’s a great honour. I have seen the difference in the level of cricket in the last nine years with Kerala and it’s commendable. We have grown to become one of the most hardworking teams in the country. A lot has gone on behind the scenes,” Saxena added.
Shortly before the team lined up for the post-match presentation, Sarvate and Saxena shared a quiet but firm embrace. Coming from Nagpur and Indore respectively to the quaint shores of Thumba, Sarvate and Saxena worked off one another, navigating individual checkpoints while guiding the Kerala bandwagon to an unprecedented milestone.

Title: As Kerala reach Ranji Trophy final, why Salman Nizar’s helmet will be framed back home
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/as-kerala-reach-ranji-trophy-final-why-salman-nizars-helmet-will-be-framed-back-home-9849363/
Content:
SEIZING A two-run lead at the halfway stage of the final day’s play and surviving a few tense moments in the second innings as the light faded, Sachin Baby’s Class of 2025 became the first Kerala cricket team in 74 years to make it to the Ranji Trophy final. While home team Gujarat stretched the contest into the final session on Friday, the moment of the game unfolded at 11 am when the last Gujarat wicket fell.
Chasing 457 to make it to the title clash, Gujarat were 455/9. Even levelling the score was enough for Gujarat as they had been better placed on the league table. Spinner Aditya Sarvate who, with his two wickets, had spread panic after Gujarat started the day at 429/7, had the ball in hand. Just a stroke away from the target, Gujarat No.10 Arzan Nagwaswalla swung his bat but couldn’t clear gritty short leg fielder Salman Nizar. The forceful slog-sweep rebounded off Thalassery brickwall Nizar thala  to captain Baby’s palms at slip.
Nizar’s epoch-making helmet will be framed for posterity when the team returns home, the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) declared. For now, a ticket to Nagpur awaits, 74 years since the maidans of Thalassery and Tripunithura forged the cricketing dreams of India’s southwest coast, even before the ‘Kerala’ concept was conceived in 1956.
As his teammates celebrated, Nizar was stretchered out to a hospital after copping a blow on the KCA emblem. Against Jammu and Kashmir in the quarter-final at Pune last week, he partnered Basil Thampi to secure that crucial one-run lead.
Of late, Nizar and Kerala have got used to witnessing miracles. At the Narendra Modi Stadium, they never thought they were out of the game.
Kerala coach Amay Khurasiya, a former India international from Madhya Pradesh, had a chat with his two professional spin giants, Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate. They were charting a course to defend the 28-run lead by plotting three moments. Fitness trainer Vysakh Krishna said he struggled to endure the closing moments, but was reminded of the ‘Khurasiya’ effect that blanketed the boys on the field under mind-crunching pressure throughout the season.
“He had curiously written down the number ‘2’ on his wrist last evening and kept repeating today that we would either take the lead by six or two runs. Even before the final delivery, he was calm,” Krishna said.
And Saxena (4/149) and Sarvate’s (4/111) did propel their adopted state into the history books.
Trainer Vysakh would, however, point to the cohesive mentality shift under Khurasiya’s guard, an eye-opener for him in his five years with the team. “We were a team that used to hold parties and celebrate reaching the quarters in white-ball tournaments.”
1⃣ wicket in hand
2⃣ runs to equal scores
3⃣ runs to secure a crucial First-Innings Lead
Joy. Despair. Emotions. Absolute Drama! 😮

Despite blunting Kerala’s spin advances Thursday evening with an admirable combination of defence and running between the wickets, Gujarat batsmen Jaymeet Patel and Siddharth Desai were ready to play the waiting game. Baby would reveal he’d thought the final was “gone” when he dropped Patel on the final morning.
But moments later, Patel lunged a touch forward, only to leave a track for wicketkeeper Mohammed Azharuddeen to pursue. With nimble collection, he affected a stumping with the batsman’s backfoot on the line of the crease. An animated Kerala dugout soon emerged on the sidelines with hope reposed and a struggling Sarvate regaining his lost composure. He would also account for Desai.
Battling a finger fracture, Gujarat No.11 Priyajitsinh Jadeja walked out and ticked off 30 deliveries to send Kerala hearts pounding. But when the typical tail-end wantonness kicked into Nagwaswalla’s muscles, Nizar’s sturdy cranium would make a desperate late reflex as Kerala swung the see-sawing contest dramatically their way.
For cricket-mad Kerala research students, Adwaith and Vaishnav, who had travelled from Gandhinagar and tussled with the security guards for entry for the last day at an empty 1.3 lakh-seater venue, the six-hour humdinger was all about “nimitham”. Destiny and overwhelming serendipity.

Title: Champions Trophy: Ryan Rickelton’s 103 hammers Afghanistan into submission as SA win by 107 runs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-ryan-rickelton-hammers-afghanistan-into-submission-9849359/
Content:
A weightlifting national champion at school, Ryan Rickelton muscled South Africa to a spirit-soaring scything of Afghanistan in Karachi. A resourceful, well-grooved unit, the Proteas had weirdly stumbled onto a lean patch this year in this format, winless until Friday, and consequently not counted among the outright favourites. But when the whistles of big-ticket tournaments buzz their ears, they inevitably turn up.
So they did, to the lively cheers of scattered locals, though eventually drowned out in the acoustics of the Afghanistan supporters. Agonisingly for them, South Africa laid bare Afghan vulnerabilities, in a format in which they are work in progress. From cracking the 50-over temperament to scientifically plotting a steep chase and taking wickets in the middle-overs, there are holes that impede their evolution from party-spoilers to knockout  hopefuls, as they stuttered to 208 all out, chasing South Africa’s 315 for 8. Apart from Rahmat Shah’s plucky 90, they had few takeaways from the game.
Conversely, South Africa are a well-worn side, a last-four guarantee in most global tournaments. Every time they seem to experience a talent crunch, someone invariably springs. The shoes of Quinton de Kock are enormous too but Rickelton has seamlessly slipped into them. Their background is similar—multi-sports taste and excellence, penchant for outdoor life and supportive sports-mad families. The resemblance pretzels are further bonded by their southpaw savagery.
But he is a different batsman in constitution, style and methods. De Kock was lean and tall; Rickelton stockier and muscular. De Kock fetishised the region behind the square, using his powerful wrists to flay the ball fine; not that he was daft at hitting down the ground or shovelling through midwicket. Rickelton is schooled more in the Graeme Smith tradition of batting. He is not so much of wrists, as he is about quick hands, biffed strokes and inscrutable temperament. He nails the pull as brutally as most batsmen, but he prefers hitting down the ground.
A gorgeous off-drive, so svelte that you wonder how he controlled his muscles to not impart too much power, tee’d him off. But Fazalhaq Farooqi felt the sting of his brute force when Rickelton cut him for successive fours. When the balls were full at the start, he struggled to gauge the inherent sluggishness of the pitch and was too early into his shots. The lack of pace of Afghanistan seamers rebelled with his turbocharged impulses. But the short-balls liberated him and punctured the strangling tactics of Afghanistan.
When Mohammad Nabi ejected Tony de Zorzi and boundaries trickled, he relied on nudges and glides to motor along. His boundary-hitting prowess precedes him, but he is also a canny accumulator. Quick and a sharp judge of singles, he ran 66 of his 103 runs. He expertly nullified Rashid Khan, his franchise friend in South Africa T20, he smothered the spin with decisive hands. The strike rate hovered at 90 or thereabouts, even as Temba Bavuma, his partner in the 129-run second-wicket stand, found run-scoring difficult.
Further indication of his maturity, honed by dizzying fluctuations of form in his domestic career and repeated deliberations to quit the game, reflected in his prudent choice of bowlers to target and moments to seize. Rashid and the excellent Nabi were neutered with care, milking them for singles and twos. But the likes of medium-paced Farooqi and Azmatullah Omarzai were remorselessly punished. He sashayed down the track to thunder Farooqi to the stands over long-on, before crashing Azmatullah for two fours in three balls.
The boundaries let up the pressure the spinners were diligently building. Rashid and friends teased and tickled Rickelton and Bavuma, but could not twist the knife on them. The association swelled, Bavuma unboxed a few strokes to lift the momentum, and South Africa embraced a higher tempo.
Preserving wickets while sustaining a steady rate of scoring has been the preferred template for sides batting first this edition, rather than the full-throttle attack that teams, especially India and South Africa, espoused in the 2023 World Cup. It could be the response to the (relatively) slowish nature of the wickets, where some balls stop at batsmen as early as the first powerplay. The pitches are not appreciably fast and bounce is spongy. So the return of the old strategy to lay the foundation before going berserk at the death. Teams have thus packed the lower-order with robust strikers.  Even if Tristan Stubbs and Heinrich Klaassen were on the injury list, breezy half-centuries from Rassie van der Dussen, one of Rickelton’s heroes, and Aiden Markram, slapped 85 runs in the last 10 overs and propelled South Africa to 315 for 6.
A week ago, they had posted 352 and still lost. But that was an aberration, as Kagiso Rabada and Co scavenged on the zombified Afghanistan batsmen. A regular stream of wickets stalled whatever little hopes the Afghans had nursed of overhauling the target. At the halfway stage, they were simply looking to prop up the net run rate. The weight on the shoulders crushed them.

Title: IND vs PAK: Shahid Afridi says India has more match-winners than Pakistan

Content:
IND vs PAK: Ahead of the big India vs Pakistan clash in the group stage of the Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday, former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi has handed a damning indictment of the current Pakistan team. Afridi claimed that the current team that is looking to defend its Champions Trophy title doesn’t have players who know how to win a game single-handedly.
“If we talk about match-winners, I’d say that India has more match-winners compared to Pakistan. A match-winner is someone who knows how to win the game single-handedly. Right now, we don’t have such players in Pakistan,” Shahid Afridi said on JioHotstar for a special show in the build up to the India vs Pakistan game.

In the show, Afridi was joined by Yuvraj Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu, and former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq.
Talking about India, Afridi said: “India’s strength lies in its middle and lower order, which has been winning them matches. For a long time, we have been giving opportunities to players, but no one has stepped up consistently. Some have performed in a few games, but we don’t have players who have sustained their performance for a year, two years, or across 50-60 matches. That’s where we are a little weaker compared to India, which is very strong in this area. But the key to winning against India is collective performance — whether it’s the batsmen, bowlers, or spinners — everyone’s contribution is crucial.”
Shahid Afridi also weighed in on Mohammad Rizwan’s captaincy.
“As a captain, Rizwan has to set an example for others — that is very important. He must perform in every game, and his attitude, body language, and leadership matter a lot. Being a captain comes with equal amounts of praise and criticism. His performance will be crucial, as he is the glue that holds the team together. He treats everyone equally, he is a fighter, and his energy on the field is infectious. I have seen him step up in big matches, and I am confident he will lead the team well.”

Title: Ranji Trophy: Vidarbha saunter past star-studded Mumbai to make successive finals
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-vidarbha-beat-star-studded-mumbai-to-make-final-9849129/
Content:
“Darnaa nahi hai inhe dekh ke, agar 19-20 ka farak ho and if you think they all are India players toh gaye kaam se. Just think of them as a player, and things will be fine,” young left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey of Vidarbha responded with confidence when asked about whether the team got carried away by seeing a star-studded Mumbai side before the game. Don’t be afraid if the difference in the two teams is marginal, and don’t get intimidated by them being India players – was his thinking.
Vidarbha continued their dream run in the ongoing domestic season as they defeated Mumbai to reach finals of the Ranji Trophy for consecutive years. They will meet Kerala next week to decide the title. But on paper, they have already defeated a top Mumbai team which had two Indian captains, and one India all-rounder.
Mumbai’s tailenders challenged the hosts and they tried to delay the inevitable despite wickets falling at regular intervals.
Mumbai needed an extraordinary display of batting to get 323 runs more on the final day while Vidarbha needed a mere seven wickets. On the pitch which had begun to show cracks and resulted in uneven bounce on a few occasions, it was a matter of seven good balls. All-rounder Shivam Dube got bowled early in the innings by pacer Yash Thakur as the ball passed between bat and pad to see his stumps rolling. All eyes were on Suryakumar Yadav to showcase his world class batting, and he did get a start but the big score seemed to be far away just yet, from his blade. Mumbai lost Surya and opener Akash Anand in quick succession courtesy young left-arm spinner Harsh, who had been bowling very tight lines throughout the game.
The onus was once again on the lower order who have been Mumbai’s batting lifeline since past two seasons. They tried to delay the inevitable, especially Shardul Thakur and Shams Mulani. On a pitch where Indian batters failed to find their feet and get behind the ball, Thakur played some elegant drives with his blade. He slapped hard at one from pacer Darshan Nalkande for six over point which probably was the best shot one witnessed throughout the innings.
With Mulani and Thakur holding their nerve, at one stage Mumbai looked to achieve the impossible task. The pair didn’t make any mistake, though on a few occasions Thakur tried reverse shots to upset left-arm spinners Harsh and Parth Rekhade’s lines. Vidarbha needed one extraordinary effort and it came when Thakur tapped one at square leg and ran for a quick single. Mulani acknowledged the call but before he could dive to reach his crease, Danish Malewar’s direct hit had done the damage. The 103 runs seventh wicket stand was broken and gave much relief to the Vidarbha camp. Thakur, who struck a brilliant 66, was bowled after Vidarbha took the new ball and Yash Thakur got one which skid in to see his stumps uprooted. The end looked near but Mumbai tailenders continued to fight despite knowing they could end up on the losing side.
Vidarbha managed to snare Tanush Kotian as Rekhade got him bowled. However, number ten Mohit Avasthi and number eleven Royston Dias didn’t seem to surrender and they did try for one last battle. They added a 52 runs-partnership for the last wicket and just one over after tea with 80 runs more needed, Harsh got his 66th wicket after Avasthi went out leg before while attempting a reverse sweep.
The team which on paper doesn’t have a single IPL star, had defeated 42 time Ranji Trophy title winners this season. Back in Vidarbha’s dressing room, players had discussed how Mumbai had beaten them in the finals last year and this time they had the opportunity to beat them at home.
Vidarbha skipper Akshay Wadkar said they took on Mumbai as any other team and didn’t go by the reputed names. For Mumbai, this season, their top orders have failed and big names remain only on paper. The lower-order shouldered a bulk of the responsibility with the bat and captain Rahane says, they will discuss all the pointers once the new season starts later this year.
As the match got over Vidarbha players and their families came down on the field, and requested photographs with Surya, Shardul and Rahane. Back in the dressing room’s passage, Vidarbha players sought out autographs and their jersey and they all obliged. And some even had video calls made to their families. A perfect photo-finish for the team, who have remained unbeaten this season of Ranji Trophy.
Vidarbha 383 & 292 defeat Mumbai 270 & 325 (Shardul Thakur 66, Mohit Avasthi 34, Harsh Dubey 5-127) by 80 runs

Title: How Mohammed Shami overcame doubt and fear after long injury layoff: ‘Wondered when I’d be able to put my feet on ground again’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-mohammed-shami-overcame-doubt-and-fear-after-long-injury-layoff-9849072/
Content:
At some point during his long rehabilitation, Mohammed Shami genuinely feared that the 2023 World Cup final was his last outing. In recent times, Indian cricket has seen the incredible comeback story of Jasprit Bumrah, who underwent a career-threatening back injury. With Shami, the story was no different. Unlike his pace-bowling partner in crime, even a casual walk was out of bounds for the 34-year-old, who on Thursday became India’s most successful bowler in ICC tournaments with 60 wickets in 19 matches.
“I always wondered when I would be able to put my feet on the ground again, as someone who is used to running on the field constantly was now in crutches,” Shami told ICC about his recovery. “A lot of thoughts used to run through my mind. Will I be able to do it again? Will I be able to walk without a limp? For the first two months, I often doubted whether I would be able to play again as an injury like this followed by a 14-month break can pull you down.”
For more than two months after surgery, Shami’s right foot didn’t touch any surface. For someone who loved running on his farm land to strengthen his muscles, he would spend the entire period on crutches, minimising his movements. Some of those evenings would be spent watching IPL on television. At other times, he would just sit idle, counting down the number of days.
“My first question to the doctor was ‘how many days until I can be back on the field’. He said, ‘my priority is to get you to walk, then jog, then run. Thinking about playing competitive cricket is still a distant goal. After 60 days, when they asked me to put my feet on the ground, I have never been more scared to do so. I felt like a toddler learning to walk, and was worried about any complications.”
Soon after the IPL, Shami would resume the long road to recovery. “Cliched as it may sound, but it was a step-by-step process literally,” says a source in the know. “First he had to walk steadily without any pain because his Achilles tendon had been operated upon and he wasn’t able to take a lot of load. Once that phase went smoothly, he resumed jogging and then moved on to running. Even with running, he had to increase his pace gradually rather than going full throttle from the start. As he said, it was like a toddler learning the process.”
Back then, it seemed as if Shami’s recovery was on the right track with everyone involved in his rehab looking at the home series against New Zealand for his comeback. But since his body was taking a sudden increased workload, the pacer would suffer from a swollen ankle.
“It wasn’t a new injury. During the recovery process, these things happen. At that time, the most important thing was not to let his confidence get down. We could see how much he was missing cricket, so we would advise him not to watch and instead just stick to the rehab process,” the source says.

What followed was a gruelling period when Shami would spend as many as eight hours at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) facility everyday with BCCI’s medical team head Nitin Patel keeping a close tab. He would shed a few kilos, pick up pace in his running, start bowling at the nets and even get back to the domestic fold.
However, one aspect was still missing, according to someone in the team management.
“Shami is a rhythm bowler. From his run-up to load-up and follow-through, everything is rhythmic. Even if one of the elements is not in place, he wouldn’t be at his best. One of the reasons why his comeback took longer than expected was that he had to find that rhythm back. And he was going to get it only if he bowled a lot of overs,” the source said.
It is one of the reasons why India decided not to carry him to Australia even though they were clearly short on options when it came to fast bowling. It is what even prompted skipper Rohit Sharma to say that they were not looking at Shami until he was fully ready.
“The last thing we wanted for him was being hit around by batsmen as it would dent his confidence massively. Since he didn’t have the rhythm, we could see him struggle even in domestic cricket. It was hurting him as well, but he quickly got the message that he wasn’t going to get the rhythm overnight,” the source adds.
After playing Ranji Trophy, Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy, the selectors would put him in India’s T20 mix just to ease his comeback.
“I’d completed 14 months of recovery and one has to be loyal to that process. You should have the hunger to achieve your goal, to get back the form you were in, and to get back your rhythm. If you have that hunger, you will be able to achieve it again,” Shami said.
On Thursday, he certainly did. Although he was still far from his best with regard to his rhythm, with his five-wicket haul against Bangladesh at the ICC Champions Trophy, Shami showed he isn’t far off.

Title: Ashwin blasts Babar Azam over his approach: ‘Where was his intent? Did he keep it at home?’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ashwin-blasts-babar-azam-approach-intent-did-he-keep-it-at-home-9848985/
Content:
Former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has questioned the intent of Pakistan batsman Babar Azam after the Pakistani opener played a scratchy knock of 64 runs off 90 balls during hosts Pakistan’s 60-run loss against New Zealand in the opening match of Champions Trophy in Karachi on Wednesday earlier this week. Azam, who got his 35th ODI half-century in the match, could only add 12 runs off 27 balls in the first ten overs during the 321-run chase and Ashwin took a dig at the former Pakistani batsman.

“I want to say one thing about Babar Azam is a very talented cricketer. But people should not get angry that I have criticized him. Yesterday also, he played a fantastic cover drive. But, the result of the entire game cannot be made by one cover drive. It has to be played completely. I understand that if a batsman is out of form or gets out because it’s a sport. I don’t know how to phrase it. But where was his intent? Did he keep it at home? I don’t know what he did,” shared Ashwin while speaking on his YouTube channel Ash ki Baat.

Chasing New Zealand’s total of 320 runs, the Mohammad Rizwan led Pakistan team made a slow start as opener Saud Shakeel departed with the scoreboard reading 8 for 1 in 3.4 overs. Azam and Rizwan would then score 14 runs in the next 6.2 overs followed by Rizwan’s dismissal. Pakistan could cross the 50-run mark in the 16th over and Azam and Fakhar Zaman could only add 19 runs in the next five overs bowled by spinners Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips before Zaman was dismissed. Azam was then joined by Salman Agha, who then played a knock of 42 runs off 28 balls. Till the time Salman Agha came to bat, the score did not move at all. I agree that if the ball is seaming or there is swing, then it’s okay. The wicket was a bit difficult as the ball was spinning a bit but it was staying low. There were two off-spinners bowling and Babar Azam did not try to hit one single ball by coming forward. He came forward on the wrong ball. When Bracewell and Phillips were bowling by keeping one short square leg, he did not play lap sweep against those bowlers. I was having a doubt in my mind whether he is playing because of confidence or he does not have shots like sweep, reverse sweep and not playing cut well. He was only playing cover drive,” Ashwin added.

Ashwin also questioned why Babar did not take risks against Bracewell and Phillips. While Azam fell in the 34th over, Khushdil Shah’s 49-ball 69 made sure that Pakistan reached a total of 260 runs. “Fakhar Zaman was playing two spinners. Till the time Fakhar Zaman was playing, Mitchell Santner did not come to bowl. Zaman was taking risks with an injured muscle but Babar was not taking risks. I don’t know where it was the team’s plan or Babar’s plan to play the sheet anchor role. But I was genuinely disappointed. After all that happened, Pakistan made 260. All credit to Salman Agha and Khushdil Shah,” Ashwin said.

Title: Anil Kumble’s blunt take on Virat Kohli: ‘He’s trying too hard to score runs’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/anil-kumbles-blunt-take-on-virat-kohli-hes-trying-too-hard-to-score-runs-9848938/
Content:
With Indian batsman Virat Kohli falling against the leg-spin of Rishad Hossain during India’s six-wicket win over Bangladesh in their opening match of the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it meant that the 36-year-old was dismissed for the fifth time by a leg-spinner in his last six ODIs. Kohli, who is currently 15 runs short of the 14,000 ODI runs mark, fell to a full delivery by Rishad Hossain as his late cut resulted in a catch to Soumya Sarkar at an individual score of 28 runs. Former Indian spinner and coach Anil Kumble sees these dismissals as Kohli trying too hard to score runs and not playing his natural game.
Champions Trophy 2025, AFG vs SA LIVE Cricket Score: Watch Here
“To start off against spin, on surfaces like that, you need a lot of confidence. He’s certainly trying too hard to manoeuvre that. He’s a good player of spin when he’s in form, when he’s wanting to just knock singles off and keep rotating the strike. Now he’s trying too hard to score runs rather than just manoeuvre, and that’s been his game plan. All players go through tough moments in their career, but I get a feeling watching him bat, I think he is putting a lot more pressure on himself. He just needs to relax a little bit and not worry too much about the outcome of what happens on the field rather than just go out there and have the freedom to just go and play naturally, which he does really well,” Kumble said on ESPNcricinfo.
AFG vs SA Match LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
Post the 2023 World Cup, Kohli had only played in six ODIs with only one half-century in those six matches. During the Sri Lanka ODI series last year, Kohli’s dismissals came against leg-spinners  Wanindu Hasaranga, Jeffrey Vandersay and left-arm wrist spinner Dunith Wellalage. During the ODI series against England early this month, Kohli fell twice to England leg-spinner Rashid Khan. Kohli had a lean patch in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia as he scored a total of 190 runs at an average of 23.75 in nine innings. Kumble sees the lean patch as the reason for Kohli trying ‘too hard’. “Having been through a lean patch, so to speak, especially in white-ball cricket – he hasn’t had that kind of run for a long period of time – I feel he’s trying a bit too hard. You have that in players who have been there and done that before, and everyone sort of looks up to you saying he’s the guy who’s going to take the game away and he’s the one guy who is the important man in the team,” said Kumble.

The former Indian spinner also shared how Kohli needs to stop worrying and play with the kind of freedom Indian skipper Rohit Sharma displays.”I think he’s trying a bit too hard. You can see that in the way he is going about his innings. He just needs to not worry about it. Rohit [Sharma] comes in there, has the freedom because there is plenty of batting and all of them are in great form. Similarly for Virat, he just needs to come in and not worry about anything else,” said Kumble.

Title: Champions Trophy: Anil Kumble says Gautam Gambhir will have to make tough calls about transitioning from ‘legacy players’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-anil-kumble-gautam-gambhir-tough-calls-transitioning-legacy-players-9848826/
Content:
While the Rohit Sharma-led Indian cricket team began their Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket win over Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, the spotlight was on the form of skipper Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Sharma played a 36-ball 41-run knock while Kohli could manage a score of 22 runs off 38 balls. With the spotlight on both the players, former Indian player and coach Anil Kumble believes coach Gautam Gambhir should need to start looking ahead and to make ‘tough decisions’ if need arises.
Champions Trophy 2025, AFG vs SA LIVE Cricket Score: Watch Here
“You could say this is a very important tournament for a coach who has to make those tough calls in terms of transitioning from the legacy players to the others. But that’s the job of the coach, to make those hard decisions. This tournament could determine where those seniors would go, and where India would look at making those changes. Win or lose, you need these tough calls to be made at the earliest. You need to start looking ahead in white-ball cricket, especially at the 2027 World Cup,” Kumble told ESPNCricinfo.

Sharma crossed the 11,000-run mark in his ODI career during Thursday’s match against Bangladesh while Kohli is currently 15 runs short of the 14,000-run mark in his ODI career. Both the senior players have an ODI average in excess of 48 with Sharma’s ODI average being 49.01 and Kohli’s ODI average being 57.78. While both the players retired from T20Is post India’s T20 World Cup last year, Kumble believes that current coach Gautam Gambhir needs to build the squad for the 2027 ODI World Cup at present and emphasised on the squad playing at least 20 or 25 matches together. “In any World Cup, you’re looking at building a squad that has played at least 20 or 25 matches together. That’s when you understand the nuances of match situations, and who to rely on. Ideally, at the end of this tournament, you must start looking ahead to the next World Cup. Do the seniors make it there? Or do we give the opportunity to youngsters to take the team forward in the shorter formats and build a strong unit? These are questions Gambhir needs to address,” Kumble added.

The Champions Trophy Indian squad has seen youngsters like Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh being included in the squad with Rana playing against Bangladesh on Thursday. With the next ODI World Cup to be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia, Kumble advised Gambhir to give the new players a consistent run. “He (Gambhir) has a fresh, young team and plenty of players to choose and build from, so he needs to organically start preparing for the 2027 World Cup. In T20Is, he’s done well. Suryakumar Yadav has been a great captain. The next World Cup is still two years from now, and the new set of players will need a consistent run of games playing with each other, to understand many things like the batting order, match situation, and tactics,” said Kumble.

Over the years, Gaddafi Stadium’s pitch is considered to be excellent for batting. In the recently-concluded ODI tri-series matches at the venue suggest bowlers will face a challenge. High scores were common in those games, with teams like New Zealand and Pakistan posting totals over 300. Therefore, the Australia vs. England match is also anticipated to be a high-scoring affair.
It’s likely to be a clear day with no rain predicted. The temperature is set to be in the early 20s in the first half of the game. After the sunset, the temperature is set to hover between 15-20 degrees Celsius.

Title: Virender Sehwag scoffs at Bangladesh: ‘Was never afraid of them while playing, why would I be afraid now?’

Content:
At 144/4, with 85 runs left to make in 20 overs, there may have been a slight tension among India’s ranks even if their run chase was completed with relative ease against Bangladesh in their Champions Trophy opener on Thursday.
Former India opener Virender Sehwag, however, scoffed at the suggestion that Bangladesh could have threatened his former side and defended the low total of 228 in Dubai.
“I don’t think there would have been (any tension) among the fans. It’s Bangladesh… you guys have made me praise them so much as if they are an incredible team,” Sehwag said on Cricbuzz Live.
“(Scared) of Bangaldesh? When I was playing, I never had any fear so what would I have been scared of today in this studio,” he replied at a question of feeling tense during the chase. “It’s Bangladesh, not Australia or Pakistan, that they would be very unpredictable. I don’t think there would have been even 1% of fear in the hearts of any fan during that match.”
India eventually came home with 21 balls to spare, as a crucial partnership between KL Rahul and Shubman Gill – who completed his hundred – allowed them to win without much of a blip.
Sehwag believes that the target would have been chased down much quicker had a couple of wickets not fallen at the wrong time.
“It was a very easy game. Got there with almost four overs to spare. Gill was composed, playing slowly. Had Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli or Shreyas Iyer stayed on the crease for longer, I could see this match getting over in 35 overs also,” he said.

Title: Shubman Gill is the next Virat Kohli: Mohammad Hafeez
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shubman-gill-is-the-next-virat-kohli-mohammad-hafeez-9848407/
Content:
Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez has lauded centurion Shubman Gill, who dug deep, scored the slowest ODI hundred and India’s slowest in the last six years and steered India’s chase and remained unbeaten on 101 off 129 balls. Gill hit nine fours and two sixes in his knock.
“For the past three years, since Shubman Gill came to this Indian side, he has been trying to be the next Virat Kohli. He is trying to take that legacy forward,” Mohammad Hafeez said on “Game On Hai.”
Hafeez showered praise on the maturity the 25-year-old has shown against Bangladesh.
“It was his eighth ODI hundred but it was one of his slowest centuries,” said Hafeez.
“But the thing that made me very happy was that he batted according to the situation.
“On this pitch the requirement was to absorb the pressure, to control the game.
“He played against his nature (attacking cricket) and instead of that he produced the match-winning performance. Which to me is heartening to see that someone who is just 25 is controlling the game very well.
“He knows when to attack and when he needs to absorb the pressure.
“He is one of the player who likes to perform at the big stage. He took the responsibility and finished the game. He has controlled the game beautifully,” said Hafeez.
Gill shared 69 off 59 balls with captain Rohit Sharma in an opening partnership that put India ahead of the run rate required, and 87 off 98 with Lokesh Rahul, who was 41 not out and hit the winning runs, a hook for six.
“Gill, we know the class he has,” Sharma said. “What he showed us, it shouldn’t surprise anyone. What was good to see was he was there till the end.”

Title: Watch: How a rule change after Philip Hughes death led to bizarre dismissal that gave Kerala vital two-run lead in Ranji semifinal against Gujarat

Content:
On Friday, with Ranji Trophy final qualification within reach, Gujarat’s No. 10 batsman, Arzan Nagwaswalla, played a powerful slog-sweep. The ball ricocheted off the helmet of Salman Nizar at the short leg and then landed safely in the hands of captain Sachin Baby at first slip, virtually putting Kerala into the final on the fifth morning of their semifinal clash in Ahmedabad.
With only 28 runs and three wickets remaining, Kerala’s trusted players, Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate, stepped up to propel their adopted state team toward their first Ranji Trophy final in 74 years since the side first appeared in the prestigious tournament in 1951-52. 1 In reply to Kerala’s 457, Gujarat were bowled out for 455 runs.
1⃣ wicket in hand
2⃣ runs to equal scores
3⃣ runs to secure a crucial First-Innings Lead

The bizarre dismissal helped Kerala secure their place in the final for the first time in their 352nd Ranji appearance.
This mode of dismissal was implemented by the International Cricket Council in 2017, allowing players to be caught, stumped, or run out off the helmet worn by a close-in fielder.
The review, conducted following the death of Phillip Hughes, recommended that the highest standard of helmets become mandatory for batsmen facing fast and medium-pace bowling, wicketkeepers standing up to the stumps, and for fielders positioned close to the batter (except slips fielders).
The change came after the MCC’s world cricket committee, featuring the likes of Ricky Ponting, Kumar Sangakkara, and Sourav Ganguly, determined that catches and stumpings should be permitted after the ball has struck a helmet worn by a fielder.
“It is felt that balls rebounding off a fielder’s helmet could equally help or hinder the fielding side, and so the suggestion that rebounds off the helmet make catches easier should be disregarded,” the committee said in a statement.
Australian Test opener Usman Khawaja had voiced his disapproval about the dismissal at the time.
A ball hiting the close in fielder’s helmet and caught shouldn’t be out. It is not a compulsory fielding position. Keeper is understandable.

Title: Ranji Trophy drama: Kerala virtually in final after securing two-run lead over Gujarat

Streaks of impetuousness and a truckload of nerves were laid bare on the field as Kerala and Gujarat’s block-buster Ranji Trophy semifinal at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad confirmed an outright leader on the fifth morning. With only 28 runs and three wickets to play with, Kerala’s trusted lieutenants Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate pulled up their socks and lengths to propel their adopted state team towards their first Ranji Trophy final in 74 years since the side first appeared in the prestigious tournament in 1951-52.
In their 352nd Ranji appearance, Kerala’s immense resolve under coach Amay Khurasiya and skipper Sachin Baby drafted the golden final berth after the side saw off Gujarat’s lower-order rearguard during the pursuit of a 457-run first-innings score. By securing a two-run first innings lead at the half-way stage of the final day’s play, Kerala virtually secured a place in the final where they are expected to play Vidarbha.
It all boiled down to that one run, Kerala’s favoured mind-numbing zone of the season. The same significant one run that Salman Nizar and Nidheesh MD miraculously manufactured in Pune last week. Only a swipe away from securing qualification, No. 10 Arzan Nagwaswalla’s forceful slog-sweep culminated with a symbolic finish – a rebound off their star-batter Salman Nizar’s head at short leg and captain Sachin Baby’s palms at first slip.
Despite blunting Kerala’s spin advances on day four evening with the admirable measure in defence and running between the wickets, Jaymeet Patel and Siddharth Desai’s fortitude wavered under mounting pressure.
After building a chanceless knock throughout on the might of singles, Jaymeet stepped into a reckless zone when he advanced to a loopy Sarvate delivery and chopped the ball to Baby who let a regulation catch off the hooks at cover. Moments later, Jaymeet lunged a touch forward, only to leave a track for wicket-keeper Mohammed Azharuddeen to pursue. Beaten outside off, Azharuddeen’s nimble collection and flick stumped Jaymeet with his backfoot on the line of the crease. An animated Kerala dugout soon emerged on the sidelines with hope reposted with a struggling Sarvate regaining composure.
Changing ends, the left-arm spinner soon slid one into Desai’s pads with the ball popping up to short leg, prompting the umpire to raise his finger for a catch. Though Desai heaved a sigh of relief after the DRS showed no spikes, the TV umpire Saidarshan Kumar offered a twist with Desai’s feet falling in line of the stumps. Three reds and the southpaw’s 164-ball resistance was packed off with the finish line 11 runs away.
The last pair of Nagwaswalla and Priyajitsinh Jadeja held the fort and trickled the deficit before the typical tail-end wantonness kicked into Nagwaswalla’s muscles.

Title: Wasim Akram showers praise on Team India captain Rohit Sharma: ‘There is a lazy elegance about him’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wasim-akram-showers-praise-on-team-india-captain-rohit-sharma-9848067/
Content:
Legendary Pakistani cricketer Wasim Akram praised Team India captain Rohit Sharma after his brisk knock against Bangladesh in their Champions Trophy opening match at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.
Rohit Sharma scored a quick-fire 41 off 36 balls and shared a 69-run opening partnership off 59 balls with centurion Shubman Gill, putting India ahead of the required run rate.
“There is a lazy elegance about Rohit Sharma. He is special. He has scored three double centuries in ODIs,” Wasim Akram said on the show “Dressing Room.”
“In 2008, during a tri-series in Australia, I was doing commentary, and all of us in the commentary box predicted that there was something special about this boy. He scored a fine 70 and looked so good to the eyes,” he said.
Cheteshwar Pujara commented on how Rohit Sharma’s batting helped Shubman Gill settle down and score his eighth one-day international hundred. Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 101 off 129 balls. India chased down the target with 21 balls to spare.
“His batting complements Gill. Rohit’s attacking style helps Gill settle down,” said Pujara.
“With the strike rate he bats at in the first five overs, the score is 40. The other batter can take 10-15 balls to get set. Even if India lose a wicket early and Rohit is still at the crease for the next ten overs, he makes life easy for Virat also,” he added.
India captain Rohit Sharma on Thursday became the second-fastest batter, after compatriot Virat Kohli, to complete 11,000 runs in One-day Internationals during their Champions Trophy clash against Bangladesh.
Rohit is only the fourth Indian and 10th batter overall to reach the mark in the 50-over format.
Former India off-spinner, Nikhil Chopra, analyzed Rohit’s innings and how he was troubled by left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman.
“Against Mustafizur in the initial four-five balls, he was troubled by the left-arm seamer. Then he showed his experience. He stepped out against Mustafizur, breaking his rhythm. The bowler was forced to change his game plan,” he said.

Chopra also mentioned how Rohit Sharma was picked by former India batter Dilip Vengsarkar when the Indian captain was playing in U-19 cricket.
“Credit goes to Dilip Vengsarkar. Thanks to Dilip bhai, he spotted him. He kept telling everyone that there is a big player coming through the ranks,” said Chopra.
Wasim Akram lauded Dilip Vengsarkar for having an eye to spot such talent. “I have played with Dilip bhai. What a gutsy cricketer he was. Probably one of the few batters to score three Test centuries at Lord’s,” he said.
Cheteshwar Pujara, who was in the same U-19 team with Rohit Sharma, added: “Rohit and I were in the same U-19 batch, and we knew that Dilip sir had picked him.”

Title: Champions Trophy 2025, India vs Bangladesh: Towhid Hridoy shows the heart for a fight
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-2025-india-vs-bangladesh-towhid-hridoy-shows-the-heart-for-a-fight-9847914/
Content:
For a brief moment Towhid Hridoy stood with his eyes closed and soaked in all the applause, including from Indian players.
Century-maker Hridoy’s journey to the international stage has been one of hardship and sacrifice. He was once rejected by the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan (BKSP), the premier sports institution in the country. Then the Bogra-based family’s savings were swindled away by a fake cricket academy where Hridoy had enrolled.
Yet, every setback made him only stronger.
But there was joy, and also pain, for Hridoy at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday en route to his 100 against India in their Champions Trophy opener.
On 98, battling severe cramps that were hampering his movements, Hridoy put in a desperate dive to move to 99. Running out of partners, under the sweltering heat, his body had given up the moment he entered the 90s. By the afternoon, he had already done an incredible bail-out job by combining with Jaker Ali to help Bangladesh recover from 35/5.
This, however, was a moment that Hridoy has been waiting for since he picked up the bat, inspired by Bangladesh’s mother-of-all shock wins at the World Cup, over India in 2007. Growing up in Bogra, Hridoy knew what he wanted in life when he saw his idol Mushfiqur Rahim pick up a stump after that win over India at Trinidad in 2007.
“When I saw that stump in person during a programme in Bogra, I was really inspired by it. I was very little. I dreamed from that day that I wanted to play for the national team,” he would say of that moment when he fell in love with cricket.
That win is what lit a burning desire in him, to earn a Bangladesh cap and emulate what his idol had done as a teenager. In pursuit of it, like countless talented kids in the country, he would knock on the doors of BKSP, only for them to reject him without a trial. It would lead him to go in search of private academies in Dhaka and when he found one, little did he know he was being taken for a ride.
Born to parents who are farmers, his mother would sell the only asset – a small piece of land they owned — to fund his academy coaching. But when he reached Dhaka, the academy proved to be a fake one.
“My father never supported my cricket. It was only because I was adamant, but my mother help me. But when I reached Dhaka, there was no such academy. I understood I was duped. I didn’t want to continue playing cricket,” he would say.
Hridoy was 12 then and a couple of years after finding a new academy, in Khaled Mahmud he would find a godfather.
Impressed by his talent Mahmud, the former Bangladesh captain, who held powerful positions in the Bangladesh Cricket Board, would give him a coaching scholarship and find him a team in the Dhaka First Division League.
From there on, Hridoy has hardly looked back. Right from his age-group levels, one aspect has stood out about Hridoy — his ability to bat long and make runs under pressure. Having modelled his batting on his idol Mushfiqur — his bat lift and slog sweep are carbon copy of the senior batsman – he has long been earmarked as a future No.4, a position he batted at when Bangladesh won the Under-19 World Cup in 2020 by beating India in the final.
A couple of years later, Hridoy’s career appeared to be fading away. Their current assistant coach Mohammad Salahuddin had tweaked his batting, to make him more technically sound, but it had led to a string of low scores. And after losing a BPL final from a winning position, he would go back to the same old bat lift and the wide stance.
On Thursday when he walked out at No.5, Bangladesh were struggling at 26/3 in 6.2 overs and in no time it would become 35/5 as their dressing room looked shell-shocked.
Over the next couple of hours, while combining with Ali and with help from Hardik Pandya–who dropped him on 23 – Hridoy would go about building an innings that
would remain special to him and show the world why his mentor Mahmud calls him the heart (Hridoy means heart in Bengali) of Bangladesh batting.
With India’s spinners, especially Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja, attacking the stumps, Hridoy would just rely on finding the gaps to fetch singles and twos.
With Ali, Bangladesh’s crisis man off late, playing another impactful innings, Hridoy would get the odd boundary here and there through slog sweeps, as Bangladesh fans began to find their voice. The 154-runs stand came off 206 deliveries, but more importantly it took Bangladesh out of trouble.

Title: Champions Trophy first impressions: Shubman Gill’s supreme shots, Mohammed Shami’s love affair with ICC events

Content:
Nearly 36 overs separated the two shots. On a night when stroke-making wasn’t easy, Shubman Gill hit two contenders for the shot of the tournament. And at the receiving end both times was Tanzim Hasan. The first was a pick-up shot that sounded so good off the bat that it almost echoed around the stadium, and landed in the top tier for a 98m six. Standing at the other end in admiration was Rohit Sharma, one of the foremost exponents of the shot. Then late on, with the finish line in sight, he flicked one almost effortlessly for another six. “The first one gave me confidence and the second one took me closer to my first ICC event century, so both were very satisfying,” the centurion said later.
It was the first time Mohammed Shami was playing in the Champions Trophy, and he continued his love story with ICC events. His statistics make for ridiculous reading. In his 19th such match, he became India’s leading wicket-taker in ICC ODI events with a five-for that took his tally to a mind-boggling 60 wickets. His average (13.28) and strike rate (15.5) are by some distance the best for bowlers who have taken at least 20 wickets in the marquee events of this format. In comparison, Glenn McGrath – who leads the wicket-taking charts in this category – had an average of 18.52 and a strike rate of 27.9. Shami is in truly elite territory.

Rishad Hossain’s place in the Bangladesh playing XI was crucial for Bangladesh. In a largely right-hand heavy top order, his leg spin was critical to take the ball away, especially with no dew predicted later in the night. And Virat Kohli’s recent struggles against leg spin was also part of that. Historically, Bangladesh’s spin attack has been dominated by right-arm and left-arm finger tweakers, so he has brought in a new dimension. And by dismissing Kohli and India’s one change-up leftie option in Axar Patel, Rishad delivered his part admirably.

The last time Rohit Sharma slammed the field at an ICC event, it was in celebration of a World Cup win. But on Thursday afternoon, it was frustration and remorse writ all over his face as he dropped Jaker Ali off the first ball, which prevented an Axar Patel hat-trick. Ali went on to stitch a superb partnership with Towhid Hridoy that brought Bangladesh back. But Ali returned the gift to India later in the night. KL Rahul, batting on 9 off 18 balls, played a rash shot that was heading straight to him at deep midwicket and the catch was put down. The camera immediately panned to Rohit in the Indian dressing room and he had a wry smile on his face. India could have been put under some serious pressure in the closing stages had that been taken but it wasn’t to be. ReplyReply allForwardAdd reaction

Title: AFG vs SA: How will pitch for AFG vs SA play and what’s weather like in Karachi?

Content:
South Africa will look to shake off its performance in the recently-concluded Tri-Series as they take on Afghanistan in the first match of Group B in Karachi. The Proteas will be bolstered by the returns of their regular first team players who were unavailable for the Tri-Series and will look to continue their recent dominance over Afghanistan in ICC tournaments.
The Proteas have defeated Afghanistan in the 2023 ODI World Cup as well as thrashed them at the T20 World Cup. With the chatters of boycott around them, the Afghanistan team, meanwhile will concentrate on their decent ODI form, having won 8 of their last 10 50-over matches.
The stadium is the same one where Pakistan played against New Zealand and lost on Wednesday in the Champions Trophy opener as well as the recent ODI Tri-Series match where the hosts had chased down 350 to win against South Africa. The pitch is expected to be a belter with spectators getting treated to huge hits. The pacers will find purchase from the surface and as the day progresses, the batters will become more comfortable in the middle. The tweakers will come into play in the latter half of the day and offer plenty of turns.
The morning is expected to be sunny in Karachi with he temperature hovering around 26 degrees according to AccuWeather. As we move towards the start of the match in the afternoon, the temperature will go up to 31 degrees and the weather is expected to be cloudy. The sky will clear around the evening with temperature dipping to 20 degrees.
Afghanistan: Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah, Ikram Alikhil, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Nangyal Kharoti, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Farid Malik, Naveed Zadran. Reserves: Darwish Rasooli, Bilal Sami

The dark horses Afghanistan will take on South Africa in the first game of Group B at Karachi on Friday with the Afghan players looking to continue their fine ODI form against the Proteas, who they had beaten last September 2-1 at Sharjah.
The Temba Bavuma-led South Africa, however, will be keen to put their recent Tri-Series performance in he rearview mirror where they lost all their matches against Pakistan and New Zealand. But that was because they were missing most of their Champions Trophy players who had SA20 league commitments. With all of their star players available now, the Proteas will start this match as hot favourites.
Even though de Zorzi scored a decent 55 off 51 against Pakistan Shaheen in a warmup match, his record for the Proteas across formats doesn’t warrant a place in the lineup with better players available. Rickelton has played 6 ODIs for South Africa and scored 188 runs with a 50 which does not seem much but would be enough to pip de Zorzi, who just has 2 fifties for the Proteas in 18 matches across all formats.
Afghanistan will heave a sigh of relief with the return of Ibrahim Zadran who was out for three months due to injury and the batter is expected to slot right in as the opener along with Rahmanullah Gurbaz. As an opening pair, these two average 48.84 with 1514 runs in 31 innings which gives Afghanistan the blistering start that they need.

Afghanistan predicted XI: Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Farid Malik
South Africa predicted XI: Temba Bavuma (c), Ryan Rickelton, Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi

Afghanistan will face South Africa in their first match of the ongoing Champions Trophy at the newly-renovated National Stadium in Karachi on Friday. At the Champions Trophy, Rashid Khan will yet again lead a formidable spin attack that has been instrumental for Afghanistan’s international success. The breakout team of the last two ICC World Cups – both ODI in 2023 and T20 in 2024 – faces a potential speed bump, though. Like the colourful ‘jingle trucks’ and ornately painted inter-city buses, batsmen are expected to strut their stuff on the belter pitches Pakistan rolls out for this 50-over tournament. Given how brittle their own batting is against spinners, all indications are that these tracks will actually resemble Pakistan highways. But the Afghans could well steer the jingle trucks and light up the highways – with or without spin.
The Champions Trophy 2025 match between Afghanistan and South Africa will be played on Friday, February 21.

Title: Shubman Gill, Mohammed Shami, and spinners star as India beat Bangladesh in spin-friendly conditions
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shubman-gill-mohammed-shami-india-bangladesh-champions-trophy-9847356/
Content:
It was the start that India needed to kick off their Champions Trophy campaign. Despite having all the arsenal that makes them a formidable white-ball outfit, there were a few doubts coming into the tournament especially against a spin-heavy attack. And through the course of their six-wicket win against Bangladesh, India went about ticking all the boxes, showing their blueprint could after all be foolproof in these conditions in Dubai where other teams are likely to struggle to get used to the nature of the surfaces.
More importantly, in the afternoon Mohammed Shami rediscovered his rhythm and their spin formula showed it would work wonders in these slow conditions, more so if they get a chance to bowl first. In the evening, a fluent Shubman Gill scored his second successive century in as many games, showing why there shouldn’t be any doubts over his spot in the ODI side. The batting depth — even if it means there is only one spot for their two X-factor bowlers Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy – is absolutely needed in these conditions and it will only make them a tough opponent to crack should the pitches remain slow going forward.
The early signs indicate that the surfaces in Dubai could get slower as the tournament progresses and test the resolve of teams that are not best equipped to change gears as and when required. By having all their matches here, India have more reasons to be optimistic when it comes to getting used to these conditions as teams arriving from Pakistan could struggle.
That the game went into 97 overs was in itself a surprise and one that wouldn’t have pleased India despite the convincing margin of victory. Made to bowl first, they had reduced Bangladesh to 32/5 inside the first powerplay and seemed to be in the mood for a kill, with the ball gripping and turning. Instead, some poor fielding which saw Rohit Sharma drop a sitter to deny Axar Patel a hat-trick in the ninth over, another drop by Hardik Pandya and a missed stumping from KL Rahul allowed Bangladesh to recover through a 154-run partnership between Towhid Hridoy (100) and Jaker Ali (68). It meant, India had to chase 229 for a win, a target which was below par, but one that definitely tested their batting line-up to an extent.
As has been the case in recent times, Rohit has a habit of killing games with the bat in the first powerplay and here he had no reasons to get rid of it. With Bangladesh seamers coming hard with the new ball and providing pace to work with, Rohit didn’t straightaway flex his muscles. But the moment he got his first boundary in the fourth over, he was on. Like the World Cup, this was an innings that ended inside the powerplay, but by the time he fell he had made 41 off the 69 runs India had on board.
From there on, began the Gill show. He had begun the night with a crisp pull but with Rohit going all out on the attack, he slowed down a bit before exploding in the ninth over with two stunning hits off Tanzim Hasan Sakib. The first one, a six, was a jaw-dropper. He just casually swatted a back-of-length delivery to the second tier over mid-wicket. A delivery later, he would walk down to another length delivery and hit it over covers leaving his captain’s mouth wide open in awe.
To put things in context, no other Indian batsman looked as controlled as Gill on this pitch when it came down to playing the big hits. And the key to it was the 23-year-old assessed the conditions, and kept shifting his gears. Though the pitch is better to bat under lights, it isn’t a one where any batsmen would be able to fluently go for boundaries. So every now and then he would go through a phase where he would bat in third gear, but would swiftly hit the top gear whenever the opportunity presented itself. That he lost Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel in the space of nine overs, and a message sent out to him from the dressing room to stay till the end also played its part, but even otherwise it was hard to see him throw it away. It was a habit that one saw in Kohli during his early years as an ODI batter. With Rahul, who was dropped on 9 at deep midwicket by Jaker Ali, providing solidity and the target getting closer, in search of his seventh century, he would hit the top gear to remain unbeaten on 101.

Earlier, although it was Shami’s five-fer that would have brought smiles to the think-tank, the spinners showed why they will have a huge role to play in this campaign. With the pitches being on the drier side, the ball gripped and turned from the word go and Axar Patel wasted no time to get rid of Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim. Thereafter, Hridoy and Ali were prepared to play Axar and Ravindra Jadeja without taking any undue risk, choosing to target Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin instead. Between the three they bowled 28 overs, gave away 123 runs for 2 wickets, but more importantly had a combined economy of 4.39, keeping Bangladesh at check.
Ahead of their much-awaited match against Pakistan, India went home ticking all the boxes.

Title: What lies behind Mohammed Shami’s march to 200 ODI wickets? A romantic heart with a sadist’s skill
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammed-shamis-march-to-200-odi-wickets-ind-vs-ban-9847213/
Content:
The eyes of television cameras searched for Mohammed Shami. When they located him, he wore a shy, warm smile. He soon broke from the crowd and ambled to the run-up point, the trajectory of the next ball playing in his mind, the off-cutter that marked his two hundredth ODI wicket now a  mere time-stamp on his remarkable cricketing journey.
The moment suitably captured the essence of Shami the man— un-theatrical and un-obsessed with the statistical peaks, a superstar with an everyman’s persona, seam-scientist with a common man’s air. He wouldn’t have burned the midnight oil digging numbers or spent sleepless nights dreaming about his No 200, or evaluated his spot in the pantheon of India’s great fast bowlers. Such trivialities don’t fuss him. He is, at the heart, a pure romantic.
The bowling is an extension of it—the flowing action, dancing as though to the percussive beats from the stands, the pliant fingers and loose, tensionless fingers coaxing the straight-seamed ball into a curvy, gyroscopic, path, and the sudden violence the ball assumes upon landing. He is perhaps, at his core, a pure sadist. For how could a syncing of such devastating beauty produce something as devilish as a well-proportioned Shami fireball!
But Shami’s journey to becoming the fastest Indian bowler to the 200-wicket mark was about blending romanticism and sadism with sweat and pragmatism. His whole bio is about the struggles to forge a career out of cricket, taking the migrant trail from the back-woodsy Uttar Pradesh village of Sahaspur to the maidans of Kolkata, where he sometimes slept in the groundsman’s tent and the man-of-match award was often a meal, a packet of sweets or a kulhad of chai. But he persevered, and reinvented himself multiple times, waged battles with the mind and body, and emerged victorious to become one of India’s greatest bowlers in Tests and ODIs.
He was nearly the lost seamer in the white-ball format. After a stellar 2015 World Cup, he sustained a fractured knee that ruled him out for nearly a year. When he returned, the white-ball stocks had plummeted. In the four subsequent years, he featured in only five games. Test-match resurrection was easier—he was born to play it—but limited-over reintegration was tougher. “Those were really tough days. I tried a lot of different things, and failed several times. But I didn’t give up and kept working harder,” he told this daily at an Idea Exchange.
The hard yards that Shami put in to shape his career has often gone unsung and unnoticed, as opposed to perhaps a batsman trying to restore his run-flow. In his wilderness days, he built a small concrete pitch in his village, installed lights fastened to poles, paid local batters to face him, and bowled hours on end with the white ball drenched in water. He bowled with the old, new, semi-old and semi-new ones, so that he learned the characteristics of it during every stage. He reaped rewards, but he didn’t stop his quest for perfection, even if at times his body revolted.
When the World Cup at home arrived, he had sculpted himself as one of the deadliest white-ball bowlers in the world. He warmed the bench in the first four games, but when his hour arrived, he marvelled the world with spells of ravaging fury, with a greatly evolved and subtle craft. This decade, he has been something of a Glenn McGrath operating at a higher pace. He hits the same channel and pounds the exact hard-length spot with no discernible change in his angle. Yet, the balls behave differently, some seams more pronouncedly than the others, some straightens off the lines, some skids, some climbs to hit the bat’s splice.
The secret lies in how he alters the angle of his wrist, indecipherable from 22 yards, to conjure different effects with the ball. And the pressure he exerts either with his middle finger or index finger on the ball. He modernised his tools bag with a cutter and slow-bouncer too. But importantly, he has ridden the habit of gifting a boundary an over. He wastes nothing and makes batsmen play at every ball, albeit uncomfortably.

The results are glowing. Since 2019, he has nabbed 102 wickets in 52 games, at an average of 21.53, striking once every 23 balls. All six of his five-wicket hauls—no compatriot has managed half as many— have arrived in the phase too. He quickly sizes up the nature of the pitch, the mindset of the batsman and the right length to bowl. He struck with his sixth ball, the ball moving a wee bit from around the stumps to graze the left-handed Soumya Sarkar. He didn’t burst into celebration or theatre. It’s the way he is; it was the way he was when he captured his two hundredth wicket and, later, his sixth five-wicket feat. He is not for the sensationalists, even if his career has been nothing short of sensational.

Title: Shubman Gill scores maiden Champions Trophy century, his 8th overall, to guide IND to victory vs BAN
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shubman-gill-maiden-champions-trophy-century-ind-vs-ban-9847182/
Content:
India vice-captain Shubman Gil continued his rich vein of form when he brought up his 8th ODI century, also his maiden Champions Trophy ton, in the match against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday as he helped his team win the match by 6 wickets. Gill, who recently scored a century and two fifties in the England series, brought up his milestone in 125 balls in an innings peppered with 9 boundaries and 2 sixes.
Gill’s century played a vital part in keeping India steady in the match after the Men in Blue lost some crucial wickets with captain Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Axar Patel and Shreyas Iyer all in the hut.
On Wednesday, Gill dethroned Pakistan’s Babar Azam from the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings by India. In the latest ICC rankings list, Gill has 796 rating points while Babar has 773. India skipper Rohit Sharma is ranked third with 761 points. South Africa’s Henrich Klaasen and New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell at fourth and fifth respectively.
Earlier, pacer Mohammed Shami returned to an ICC tournament with a five-wicket haul as Bangladesh rode on Towhid Hridoy’s maiden international century to recover from a nightmarish start and posted 228 all out against India in their opening match of Champions Trophy. On the day, Shami also picked up his 200th ODI wicket.
Opting to bat, Bangladesh were off to a disastrous start and slipped 35 for five with Shami and left-arm spinner Axar (2/43) doing the early damage.
Axar would have had a hat-trick if India skipper Rohit Sharma had not dropped a regulation catch from the blade of Jaker Ali (68 off 114 balls) at first slip.

The technically sound Hridoy in the company of Ali steadied the Bangladesh innings with a sixth-wicket partnership of 154 runs. Hardik Pandya dropped Towhid at mid-off when the batter was on 23.

Title: Concussion substitute controversy in Ranji semifinal: Kerala upset with Ravi Bishnoi’s replacement by a seam-bowling allrounder
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/concussion-substitute-controversy-ranji-kerala-ravi-bishnoi-9847187/
Content:
Kerala off-spinner Jalaj Saxena was miffed on Thursday with the “unfair” replacement of Gujarat’s concussed leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi by seam-bowling all-rounder Hemang Patel in a decisive situation of the Ranji Trophy semi-final at the Narendra Modi Stadium.
With Gujarat batting for the crucial first-innings lead after the visitors were bowled out for 457 on Wednesday morning, Kerala were intimated of the inclusion of Bishnoi’s replacement post the day’s play. The India spinner injured his face and was left with a bloodied nose during fielding before walking off the field earlier on.
With Saxena snapping two wickets in the morning session, Gujarat sent Hemang at No. 5 ahead of the team’s leading run-scorer, Jaymeet Patel, and skipper Chintan Gaja.
As the emerging concussion sub did not exactly sound by the ‘like-for-like replacement’ order of the law, Saxena was seen arguing Hemang’s entry at number five with the on-field umpire.
“Ravi Bishnoi is a bowler and he generally bats 9 or 10 for their side. And then as a concussion player, you are getting a player who bats really well and is promoted to bat number 5. I think that was unfair for us and that’s what I was telling the umpire. At least, if you have taken a batsman in place of him, make him play at number 11,” Saxena said.
Gujarat fielded Hemang after three other players on the bench – Kshitij Patel, Umang Kumar and Het Patel – posed stronger batting profiles. While Hemang’s 19.85 average from four previous First-Class outings – the lowest of the quartet – made his choice eligible, Saxena termed his inclusion unfair on Kerala. Putting on 27 runs off 41 balls, Hemang helped Gujarat regain momentum over Kerala to end the day with only a 29-run trail to seal the innings lead and potentially a final berth.

“He scored some crucial runs at that point and it was very visible that he wasn’t a bowler. He was a batsman who could bowl and not a like-for-like replacement for Bishnoi,” lamented Saxena.

Title: Kerala fight before Gujarat fight back to leave Ranji semi-final in a cliffhanger
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kerala-gujarat-fight-back-ranji-semifinal-cliffhanger-9847148/
Content:
The twisted power of recollection and hindsight can be cruel when things progressively fizzle from your grasp, leaving everything on edge with your watchfully built momentum squeezing towards the opposition. On a see-sawing day 4 of the Ranji Trophy semi-final, Jalaj Saxena’s resilience brought the game back to level terms before Gujarat’s lower-order artillery offered Kerala a taste of their own resurgent spirit.
With attrition and doggedness slicing the game down to a one-innings shootout, 29 runs/three wickets now separate Gujarat/Kerala from completing a momentous final-day triumph at the Narendra Modi Stadium. But the minds will keep ticking in the Kerala camp after a slew of hits and misses on a decisive Thursday afternoon.
‘What if the team got to 500? Did they misread the pitch on the opening day expecting bountiful assistance from the strip? Was the four-man bowling attack a huge risk in the knockouts? Did they concede runs too quickly to Gujarat’s opening pair the previous evening?’
Putting Kerala just within another shot at scripting a miraculous comeback, Saxena does not want to rewind past the Tea session.
“I don’t have any regrets that we couldn’t achieve 25 runs more [or reach 500]. But I think fielding and catching… It was something which we could have done better. We missed 2-3 chances,” rues the veteran off-spinner.
Into the third session of play, the setting was delicately poised after Gujarat slipped from their overnight perch of 221 for one to 383 for seven in pursuit of Kerala’s 457. But when Akshay Chandran let slip the situational senses in the first over, a regulation outside edge off No. 9 Siddharth Desai went down in the slips. A handy bat, Desai would block out nearly 100 deliveries more through the evening when the roughs were opening up and an over-worked Jalaj could not force his way through the defences. In the meantime, Jaymeet Patel expertly frustrated Sachin Baby’s men with a particularly frustrating medium to shrink the dicey deficit – working the gaps and maps for singles.
Featuring in his maiden Ranji season, the in-form Patel built his 161-ball 71* on the back of 66 shuttles between the stumps. For Gujarat’s promising left-handed seam all-rounder whose formative routines were warped juggling between his school, home and renowned local coach Tarak Trivedi’s academy within an hour every afternoon, the stifling feeling offered some familiarity.
Having struck two centuries and as many half-centuries in his last four innings, there was form to back up a phenomenal second wave to his first senior season. A simple target from Trivedi put Jaymeet back on track, perhaps just in the nick of time. “After the first phase of the season, I went back with about 250 runs. My coach Trivedi sir told me that I’d have four more innings to leave an impression and that I must score four centuries. He said those scores would take me someplace else,” Jaymeet, 22, said with Gujarat visualising a second final in eight years.
Starting on day three, Kerala’s lower order had added 39 runs before Gujarat snapped up the last three wickets to curtail the ‘500’ plan. Having made the journey to Ahmedabad from Pune with a momentous one-run first-innings lead, the irrepressible Saxena has not given up either.
“That’s the story of Kerala, the whole season. Every match has been played like this. The quarterfinal was also like this and the game against MP was also very close. We are now accustomed to these crunch moments. As a professional team, you have to be hopeful. And we’ll try our best,” Saxena remarked.
If not for the 38-year-old’s herculean marathon (61-12-137-4) that tugged the match back to level pegging, the curtains would have closed down on Kerala’s campaign with a day to spare.
With the roughs pronounced at the far end, Saxena operated through the entire morning from the opposite side, bowling 16 overs on the trot where he reposed hope in the Kerala camp. The clampdown began when a snappy arm ball was a trifle quicker to Manan Hingrajia’s front pad before his bat, leaving one split-screen frame for the TV umpire to adjudge the batter out lbw.
Trouble began to brew once again for the hosts when Saxena regained his lengths after going wicket-less across 25 overs the previous day. Saxena gunned down overnight centurion Priyank Panchal’s impregnable defence with a corkscrewing off-break that swooshed into the middle-stump from the rough outside off, leaving Panchal bamboozled shortly after he became the first Gujarat batter to reach 7000 Ranji runs.
Even the menacing Urvil Patel was undone by a peach, deceiving the wicket-keeper in flight before the sighted off-break held its line, rushing past the outside edge and offering a clean stumping. Replenished after lunch, Saxena stabbed the middle-order further down when he trapped Chintan Gaja. Vaguely supported from the other end later on, an energy-sapped Saxena and Kerala’s tepidness would set course for a 220-ball unbroke stand. The Jaymeet-Desai rearguard has established a predictable quick Friday finish without an unpredictable upshot.

Brief Scores: Gujarat 429/7 in 154 overs (Priyank Panchal 148, Jaymeet Patel not out 72, Jalaj Saxena 4/137) vs Kerala 457.

Title: Yash Rathod’s fifth Ranji ton and Wadkar’s gritty fifty leave Mumbai gasping in Ranji Trophy semifinal
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/yash-rathod-5th-ranji-100-mumbai-vidarbha-semifinal-9847030/
Content:
When Yash Rathod was an upcoming cricketer in his early days his uncle ensured he was penalised if dismissed early. The paternal uncle had enough of his nephew getting out cheaply, rather frequently, as he was intent on making someone in the family a cricketer, and not just sit in the family grocery shop. Luckily, by the time Rathod turned 10, he fell in love with the game.
This year has been a dreamy season for Rathod who scored his career best 151 against Mumbai in the semi-finals; his marathon innings has pushed him to third spot in the list of highest run getters this season (933 runs). On Thursday, Mumbai witnessed some khadoos-ness from Vidarbha as two of their lower-order batsmen Rathod and Akshay Wadkar refused to budge from the crease. They batted 367 balls, handled bowlers for more than two sessions and never gave any chance to Mumbai bowlers.
While the 25-year-old Rathod scored his back-to-back hundred in Ranji Trophy games, he was supported by his club-mate Wadkar with a gritty 252-ball 52.
Madhav Bakre, founder of Nagpur Cricket Academy where Rathod and Wadkar train, recalls his students’ discipline and passion.
“Rathod would bat for more than five hours. He never gets satisfied, there are days when I had to tell him ke ab bus kar, bowlers are tired. Wadkar is one who never misses his practice; even before this game, he came for an early morning practice session,” Bakre says.
They added 158 runs for the fifth wicket which brought them back in the game especially as they had lost 4 for 56 on day three.
Rathod went on to score his fifth Ranji Trophy century, a 151 off 252 balls with 11 fours. With wickets falling at regular intervals after Wadkar fell to Mumbai’s left-arm spinner Shams Mulani, Rathod looked to accelerate a bit. The last four wickets of Vidarbha accumulated 78 runs before Rathod became the last man to get out at the team score of 292. With the 113 runs first innings lead, Mumbai had to chase mammoth 406 runs on a pitch that surprised them by keeping low on a few instances.
Bakre recalls how before the season had started Rathod had kept his target clear to score 1000 runs in Ranji Trophy and at least nine hundreds in this domestic season. With this century he is close to his target, he has now scored 933 runs this Ranji Trophy season and stands at number three in highest run scorer this season list.
Rathod explained how prior to the season he had a long discussion with coach Usman Gani and video analyst where he was shown all his videos. Last season he had got out to bouncers a couple of occasions and so, he made up his mind to curb his instinct and cut out the shot. He made up his mind to convert 50’s into big scores this season.
Mumbai’s chase was dented by Vidarbha spinners who called the shots. Left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey continued this season’s steady performance, getting the opener Ayush Mhate bowled for 17. A short while later, he had Siddhesh Lad stumped. Just as the defending champions were hoping their captain Ajinkya Rahane will bail them out, they were jolted. He was dismissed for 12 after left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade’s delivery kept low post pitching that the Mumbai captain couldn’t do much and was trapped LBW.

At stumps, Mumbai were 83 for 3 with opener Akash Anand and Shivam Dube batting on 27 and 12 respectively. Vidarbha are seven wickets away while Mumbai needs 323 runs. They have Suryakumar Yadav in the hut, and need couple of batsmen to come up with big runs to ensure they reach the finals for the succession.

Title: IND vs PAK: When young Yuvraj Singh was sledged by Shahid Afridi and responded with 50 in World Cup

IND vs PAK: Passions ride high every time there is a India vs Pakistan game. Not just for the billion fans who are invested in the game, players too can get carried away with the fever-pitch excitement that an IND vs PAK encounter brings along. Yuvraj Singh found this out the hard way when he was sledged by Shahid Afridi in what was his first India vs Pakistan game.
IND vs BAN LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
The incident happened in 2003, when India and Pakistan met in a Cricket World Cup game in South Africa’s Centurion.
Batting first, Pakistan had scored 273/7. India got off to a good start, with Sachin Tendulkar scoring 98 runs. Later, Rahul Dravid (44 not out) and Yuvraj Singh (50 not out) added 99 runs for the 5th wicket to drag India to victory in the 46th over. The 6-wicket win was not without drama, because Tendulkar battled cramps and needed a runner. Afridi sledged Tendulkar relentlessly and then turned his attention towards Yuvraj.

Talking about the 2003 World Cup match, Yuvraj said in an episode of JioHotstar’s ‘Greatest Rivalry Returns’: “It’s one of the greatest ODI games I’ve played. My friend Shahid Afridi welcomed me with a lot of ‘kind words’ in that game. That was when I truly understood what the India-Pakistan rivalry meant. Watching it on TV was one thing, but playing in it was completely different. I remember the immense pressure, but performing well in that game gave me the confidence to become a better player in the future.”
Afridi also gave his point of view on the same episode.
“Yuvraj was young at the time, just finding his place in the team. We had the opportunity to play alongside legends like Inzamam-ul-Haq bhai and Wasim Akram bhai, who taught us how to fight on the ground, how to win matches, and how to unsettle the opposition. Our seniors used to tell us, ‘Show the opposition your eyes. Put pressure on them.’ But Yuvraj is the son of a Sardar—he doesn’t take pressure. He came in with confidence, and despite everything we said, he focused on his batting and handled it very well.”
In an interview with Star Sports in 2022, Sehwag had recalled how Tendulkar was targetted by Pakistan players like Afridi.
“I came to run for him during the game because he was having cramps, and Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi was abusing him a lot, kept saying something or the other. But he remained focused. He knew it was important for him to stay at the crease. He usually doesn’t take a runner, but still he knew that if I come, I will run like he does. There won’t be any misunderstanding,” Sehwag had said.
“No matter what series it is (ICC tournament or bilateral), the match between India and Pakistan is always intense. And we will always see fights or incidents taking place between players of both countries. And I remember there was a statement from Shoaib Akhtar that he will absolutely destroy the top order. I didn’t read the statement, and neither did Sachin, but Sachin did respond strongly to it in the first over of our innings. He hit 18 runs in that over,” he added.

Title: Rohit Sharma becomes second fastest to complete 11,000 runs in ODI cricket

India captain Rohit Sharma on Thursday became the second fastest batter after compatriot Virat Kohli to complete 11,000 runs in One-day Internationals during their Champions Trophy clash against Bangladesh here.
Rohit is only the fourth Indian and 10th batter overall to reach the mark in the 50-over format.
The skipper achieved the feat in the fourth over of India’s chase of 229 in their Group A match when he hit Mustafizur Rahman over mid-on for a boundary.
The seasoned opener reached the mark in his 270th game, and is the second fastest behind Kohli to cross 11,000 runs in terms of innings.
Kohli had crossed the 11,000-run mark in 222 innings while Rohit has brought up that many runs in 261 innings. In this list, they are followed by the legendary Sachin Tendulkar (276 innings), Ricky Ponting (286) and Sourav Ganguly (288).
Rohit is now placed behind former India captain Ganguly (11,363 runs) in the list of overall highest run-scorers in ODI cricket, with Tendulkar cemented firmly at the top position with 18,246 runs in 463 matches.
Kohli, who has 13,963 runs in his 299 ODIs, entered this game only 37 short of becoming only the third player in the history to make 14,000 runs in 50-overs cricket.
In terms of most ODI runs, former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara is placed second with 14,234 runs in 404 matches.
One of the most successful batters in the format at the top of the order, Rohit is also second in the list of hitting most sixes with 338 hits over the fence behind Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi (351).
Rohit averages nearly 50 in the format with 32 centuries and 52 half-centuries.

In the list of highest run-scorers, Rohit is followed by former captains Rahul Dravid (10,889 runs) and MS Dhoni (10,773), with India having as many as six batters in an overall list of 15 batters to have crossed the coveted 10,000-run mark in ODI cricket.

Title: Champions Trophy | STAT ALERT: Mohammed Shami reaches 200 ODI wickets and 60 wickets in ICC events, here’s a look at his stunning record

IND vs BAN Champions Trophy 2025: Only Mitchell Starc has done it faster. That’s the sort of elite company Mohammed Shami has kept as he reached an impressive milestone of 200 One Day International wickets during the ICC Champions Trophy clash between India and Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday. In doing so, Shami became the fastest Indian bowler to get to the milestone in terms of matches played, comfortably smashing the record held by Ajit Agarkar who did so in 133 matches.
The right-arm pacer is now eighth Indian bowler to reach the milestone in men’s ODIs. He also became the joint second fastest to do so alongside Pakistan legend Saqlain Mushtaq. The record in men’s ODIs belongs to Mitchell Starc who achieved the feat in 102 matches. He didn’t stop there as Shami picked up a five-for, and celebrated it by pointing both arm raised to the sky as his teammates got around to embrace him. It was Shami’s 60th ODI wicket in an ICC event, again the most by an Indian bowler as he went past Zaheer Khan’s tally of 59. Shami has taken those 60 wickets in just 19 matches in ICC ODI events, at a stunning strike rate of 15.5.

Shami had been out of action from international cricket after the 2023 ODI World Cup final on November 2019 until recently making a comeback. In Jasprit Bumrah’s absence, onus was on Shami at the Champions Trophy and he struck in the very first over of the match to remove Soumya Sarkar who was caught behind by KL Rahul. He struck again in his first spell, to dismiss Mehidy Hasan Miraz caught sharply by Shubman Gill at slip. Shami’s 200th was the partnership-breaking wicket as he had Jaker Ali caught by Virat Kohli. With an offcutter, he had Tanzim Hasan Sakib playing on to the stumps. Shami’s fifth was Taskim Ahmed who was caught at deep midwicket.
“All we wanted with Shami was to get back wearing that India colours more than anything else. Whether he gets wickets or not that was completely immaterial for us at that point. We wanted him to get back to playing for India,” captain Rohit Sharma had said before the match. And he’s done that. And whatever I’ve seen of him so far looks perfectly fine, absolutely fine. When you talk about a bowler like Shami who’s done the job over the years so many times for us – for them, it’s just about getting back to their rhythm and hopefully he can find some rhythm early on in this tournament and help the team.

The journey back hasn’t been easy on Shami. “From being in great form during the World Cup to suddenly finding myself needing an operation — it was really difficult,” Shami told ICC in a pre-match video. “My first question to the doctor was, ‘How many days until I can be back on the field?’ He told me, ‘The priority is let’s get you to walk. Then, jog. Then, run. Competitive cricket is still a distant goal’.”

Title: Champions Trophy: India left to rue dropped chances as Jaker Ali and Towhid Hridoy dig Bangladesh out of hole
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-india-dropped-catches-bangladesh-rohit-hardik-9846667/
Content:
The Indian team were left to rue two important dropped catches with Bangladesh batters Jaker Ali and Towhid Hridoy made the most of their second lives, steadying the Bangladesh innings after the team was down to 35/5 at one point in the match. Ali and Hridoy were both dropped at low scores and have since made the Men in Blue pay with respective half centuries.
The first dropped catch came in the 9th over when Jaker had just come out to bat and was facing Axar Patel who was on a hattrick after sending back Tanzid Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim in back to back deliveries. With three slips in place, Jaker got an outside edge and the ball went straight to Rohit who was standing in the 1st slip. It came at him at a very comfortable height but Rohit dropped an absolute dolly and beat the ground in frustration.

A post shared by ICC (@icc)
The second miss was in the 20th over when Hridoy tried a drive down the ground and the ball sailed straight to Hardik Pandya at mid-off. Pandya had got his position right but he ended up spilling the catch as the Bangla batter survived. Two overs later, Jaker survived a stumping attempt by KL Rahul.

Earlier, Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto won the toss and opted to bat against India in their Champions Trophy opener on Thursday.
India have made two changes from their previous ODI against England earlier this month, bringing in Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja in place of Arshdeep Singh and Varun Chakaravarthy.

Bangladesh have fielded three seamers and two spinners and have opted for Tanzim Hasan ahead of much-talked about Nahid Rana in the pace department.

“I had said yesterday that New Zealand are hot favourites. When teams come for big tournaments like the Champions Trophy, they tick all the boxes.

Pakistan lost the first game of the ICC Champions Trophy to New Zealand by 60 runs at Karachi. Tom Latham (118 not out) and Will Young (107) scoring tons while Glenn Phillips also chipping in with a quickfire 39-ball 61.

Title: Champions Trophy IND vs BAN: Mohammed Shami, who reaches 200 ODI wickets, recalls comeback tale – ‘Was scared to put my foot on ground…’

IND vs BAN Champions Trophy 2025: It didn’t take long for Mohammed Shami to make his mark at the ICC Champions Trophy. After a stunning run at the last ICC event he played, leading India’s charge at the home ODI World Cup, Shami spent a long time away from the game. But in Dubai on Thursday, he started off on a perfect note, that famous upright seam resulting in a wicket in the first over against Bangladesh as Soumya Sarkar edged one behind to KL Rahul. Later in the day, with his third wicket of the match, Shami reached the 200-wicket milestone. “In the absence of Bumrah, you want someone to stand up and Shami has done it in the first over. It’s that seam position again, isn’t it? We have seen it go down absolutely perfect,” former England captain Nasser Hussain said on air after his first wicket.
The journey back hasn’t been easy on Shami. “From being in great form during the World Cup to suddenly finding myself needing an operation — it was really difficult,” Shami told ICC in a pre-match video. “My first question to the doctor was, ‘How many days until I can be back on the field?’ He told me, ‘The priority is let’s get you to walk. Then, jog. Then, run. Competitive cricket is still a distant goal’.”

Shami suffered an ankle injury during the 2023 ODI World Cup final against Australia in November. In February 2024, he said he underwent an operation on his achilles tendon heel. His recovery was further complicated by swelling in his left knee, and he was sidelined from international cricket for more than a year.
“I wondered when I would be able to put my feet on the ground again. Someone who is used to running constantly for 12 months a year was now dependent on crutches,” Shami recalled. “A lot of thoughts used to run through my mind. Will I be able to do it again? Will I be able to walk without a limp? For the first two months I often doubted whether I would be able to play again as an injury like this followed by a 14-month break can pull you down.”
Shami said he was scared to even put his feet on the ground once the surgery was done. “After 60 days when they asked me to put my feet on the ground, you won’t believe me, but I have never been more scared to do so,” the 34-year-old said. “It felt like I was starting a new life, like a toddler learning how to walk and I was worried about any complications.

Shami, who thanked his family and BCCI for keeping him going, said the key was self motivation. “You endure the pain and take it one step at a time without complaints or bitterness. The passion for representing my country has brought me this far. It was tough and there was pain, but with resilience and patience I made it through. My motivation has always been to serve my country for as long as possible because once you step away, you’re just like anyone else,” Shami signed off.

Title: Afghanistan vs South Africa: Date, Time, Squad, Predicted XI, Weather Report

Content:
Hashmatullah Shahidi-led Afghanistan will lock horns against Temba Bavuma’s South Africa in their first match of the ongoing Champions Trophy at the newly-renovated National Stadium in Karachi on Friday. A savagely versatile batting consortium makes South Africa a frontrunner to raise the golden cup to the skies, even if their patchy recent form suggests otherwise. Afghanistan, the breakout team of the last two ICC World Cups – both ODI in 2023 and T20 in 2024 – will be looking to spring a few surprises in this tournament as well.
Ahead of the Afghanistan vs South Africa game, here are all the details:
The AFG vs SA match will happen on Friday at 2.30 pm with the toss at 2 pm (IST). The match will be played at National Cricket Stadium, Karachi. The match will be broadcast on TV on Star Sports and Network 18 channels. You can also livestream the AFG vs SA match on JioHotstar.
Afghanistan: Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah, Ikram Alikhil, Gulbadin Naib, Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Nangyal Kharoti, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Farid Malik, Naveed Zadran. Reserves: Darwish Rasooli, Bilal Sami
South Africa: Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Rassie van der Dussen, Corbin Bosch. Travelling reserve: Kwena Maphaka
Afghanistan predicted XI: Ibrahim Zadran, Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Azmatullah Omarzai, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Rashid Khan, Noor Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Farid Malik
South Africa predicted XI: Temba Bavuma (c), Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi
The National Stadium in Karachi is generally known to be a batting-friendly pitch. The average first innings score at this venue is around 240, but it has been increasing in recent matches. Expect scores to be higher, potentially around 270-300 or more. Recently Pakistan has chased down 350 plus against New Zealand. The pitch is expected to be flat and hard, offering good pace and bounce. This makes it conducive to high scores, with the ball coming onto the bat nicely. Fast bowlers might get some movement with the new ball, especially under lights. However, as the match progresses, the pitch tends to become easier for batting. Spinners might find some turn as the ball gets older as we have seen during the tournament opener between Pakistan and New Zealand.
The Afghanistan vs South Africa match in Karachi is expected to have pleasant weather. The forecast indicates clear skies with no significant chance of rain. The temperature is expected to be around 30 degrees Celsius during the day, gradually decreasing to around 20 degrees Celsius in the evening.

IND vs BAN Champions Trophy 2025 Playing XIs: Rohit Sharma and Co were asked to bowl first in their Champions Trophy 2025 opener in Dubai as Bangladesh won the toss. Rohit Sharma said he wanted to bowl anyway, and confirmed that Harshit Rana got the nod in the playing XI ahead of Arshdeep Singh, while the three spinners picked were Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav.

Before the match, Rohit had told reporters that the comment on India taking five spinners for Dubai’s conditions was not quite on the mark. “There are two spinners, the other three are all-rounders,” he elaborated. “I am not looking at them as five spinners. Those three guys can bat and can bowl also. The other teams have fast bowlers and all-rounders. But we work on our strength and try to run the team on that. Those three guys – Jadeja, Axar, Washi – give us a different dimension to the game, to our combination, to our squad. And they add a lot to this team and give us a lot of depth. That is why we wanted to try and get the players who can have two skills rather than one skill.”

With no dew expected as per the pitch report, batting first might not be the worst option in Dubai as per former England captain Nasser Hussain. “If you go closer to it, it’s not used, there are some mosaic little cracks on there, but in the course of 100 overs, it might get a bit tired and a bit dry towards the end. The other thing just to factor in is the dew here in Dubai, speaking to the groundsman, he says they’ve had no dew here at all during this year so far, so he doesn’t see dew being a problem, it’s a good pitch, scores here in Dubai may be a little bit lower than scores in Pakistan,” Hussain said ahead of the toss on the official broadcast.

“He is okay. He is training at the NCA,” Sanjana said when Miraz asked her, “How is Bumrah?”

The 31-year-old fast bowler was ruled out of the ICC event due to a lower back injury that he suffered while playing for India in the fifth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia. Bumrah was named in the provisional squad but on the last day to make changes to the squad, he was replaced by Harshit Rana.
Bumrah was in stellar form, having taken 86 wickets in the 21 matches he played last year across all formats. He even won the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Test Cricketer of the Year awards in 2024 for his performances.

27-year-old Miraz, who will be a key player for the Najmul Hossain Shanto-led side as they face India today, is very happy that Bumrah is not playing in the tournament.
“He is a very different bowler and very dangerous, uff! He is not coming here. We are very happy! He is very dangerous. Everybody respects him. Every better. I got out against him two times. He has improved a lot. He bowls both ways,” Miraz said.
In Bumrah’s absence, Mohammed Shami will lead India’s bowling attack.

Title: ‘Mulk phle ya Babar Azam’: Basit Ali questions Pakistan batter’s patriotism

Content:
Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has questioned Babar Azam’s “patriotism” following his 90-ball 64 knock against New Zealand in Karachi. Defending champions lost by 60 runs to New Zealand in the tournament opener. Pakistan will now face arch-rivals India in a must-win game in Dubai on Sunday.
“81 ball pe 50 kara hai Babar ne… total 90 balls mey 64 (Babar Azam has completed his half-century in 81 balls and has managed 64 balls in 90 balls),” Basit Ali said on Ary News’ cricket show “Har Lamha Purjosh.”
“Kya wo sirf 50 ke liye khel rahe they (Was he only playing for his milestone).
“Kya unhe apne mulk ke liye nahi khelna tha (Shouldn’t he played for his country).
“Mulk phle ya Babar Azam phle. Koi puchega unse (Country is first or Babar Azam is first, will someone ask him?).
“5 chauke maare apne 50 mey (you have hit only five boundaries in his knock. Usse badhiya toh Salman Ali Agha kehla hai (Salaman Ali Aghha has showed more intent than Babar Azam).
“Social media mey hume log gaddar bolte hai kyunki hum Babar Azam ko criticise karte hai (On social media fans call me traitor for criticising Babar Azam).”
Basit Ali also slammed Pakistan’s vice-captain Salman Ali Agha, who has lamented Pakistan for not able to make the most of the powerplay.  “We were hampered by Fakhar’s absence at the start of the innings. In the last five or six years, no one utilises the powerplay better than him,” Salman told reporters. “We didn’t even have 30 runs (they were 22 for 2) in the powerplay. We knew we’d have to attack from ball one and take risks. So I took those risks, but I still believe I should have taken the innings deeper.
“It was night and day between this powerplay and that one [against South Africa in the triangular series]. We scored 91 in that powerplay. When you’re chasing 320, the powerplay is instrumental to it. But Fakhar Zaman, who uses that powerplay very well, couldn’t bat then because of his injury.”
Basit Ali said: “Why is he not taking Babar Azam’s name. Fakhar was out from the team for past one year.”

Title: OFFICIAL: Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman ruled out of Champions Trophy, here’s who replaces him in the squad ahead of IND vs PAK

Content:
In a massive blow to Pakistan’s Champions Trophy title defence, Fakhar Zaman on Thursday was ruled out of ICC Champions Trophy 2025. Zaman sustained an oblique injury in the very first over of the game on Wednesday while fielding in the opening match of the tournament against New Zealand in Karachi. The development was confirmed by the International Cricket Council, as the Event Technical Committee approved Imam-ul-Haq as a replacement for Zaman in the Pakistan playing squad.
Twenty-nine-year-old Imam, who has played 72 ODIs, last played an ODI for Pakistan in October 2023, against South Africa at the World Cup in Chennai.
“Representing Pakistan on the biggest stage is an honour and dream of every cricketer in this country. I have been privileged enough to represent Pakistan multiple times with pride. Unfortunately I’m now out of ICC Champions Trophy 2025 but surely Allah is the best planner. Grateful for the opportunity. I will be backing our boys in green from home.
This is only just the beginning, the comeback will be stronger than the setback,” Zaman posted on X.

It was a freak injury for Zaman. New Zealand opener Will Young drove Shaheen Afridi through the covers, with Zaman setting off in pursuit off just the second ball of the day. He managed to cut it off before palming the ball to Babar Azam to throw it back to the keeper, but immediately appeared to feel discomfort. Zaman signalled that he needed to be replaced, and went off the field with the physio, though he walked unaided back to the dressing room.

He later tried to return to the field but went off again. He couldn’t open the batting for Pakistan given the time he spent off the field. In a statement about the injury, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said: “Fakhar Zaman is being assessed and examined for a muscular sprain, and further updates will be provided in due course.” The 34-year-old eventually came out to bat at No.4 but struggled with rhythm and scored just 24 off 41 balls with the home team losing by a massive 60 runs

Content:
Former Pakistan captain Mohammed Hafeez has questioned Babar Azam’s “intent” during his scratchy knock against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy opener against New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi. Babar scored 90-ball 64 as defending champions Pakistan lost the opening game by 60 runs.
“Babar is a top player. He has almost scored 18 to 20 thousands runs in the international cricket,” Hafeez said on PTV Sports.
“He is one of the most accomplished cricketer in this current Pakistan cricket team.
“Today he scored a fifty and he looked satisfied. Pakistan lost a game. He scored a fifty and we were not even close to win the game.
“If he would have scored this half-century with an intent, if the knock would have took the game forward then it is good. But this half-century has cost the match to Pakistan team.
“On the same pitch, under difficult conditions, the likes of Salman Ali Agha and Khushdil Shah were trying to up the ante. Why didn’t we started batting like it in the powerplay,” he said.
Hafeez also slammed the team management for risking Fakhar Zaman for the entire tournament.
Fakhar Zaman walked off the field due to a muscular sprain in his left ribcage in the first over of the game as he ran after the ball in the outfield and fell awkwardly.
Fakhar returned late in New Zealand’s innings but, according to the rules, he wasn’t allowed to open the innings until 20 minutes into Pakistan innings.
“You give the Champions Trophy to the guy, who sent Fakhar to Bat at No 4,” said Hafeez.
“Fakhar can’t run. It was a long match. He can’t hit every ball out of the park. Fakhar was not able to score the runs because of running between the wickets.
“It added extra pressure on Babar Azam. His game is not to take the momentum away. He got that help from Salman Ali Agha.
“We shouldn’t have sent Fakhar to bat. We risked it.
“Now Fakhar might get ruled out of the tournament. Now he won’t be able to play in the tournament. He was playing with pain. Tomorrow Pakistan will travel to Dubai in then two days later they will play the biggest game of the tournament.
“It will be a miracle if Fakhar gets fit before the match against India.”

Former Pakistan cricketers Shoaib Malik and Shoaib Akhtar feel Pakistan can beat India in Dubai to turn their campaign around in the Champions Trophy after losing the opening match against New Zealand in Karachi on Wednesday. New Zealand defeated Pakistan by 60 runs in the tournament opener. Pakistan will face India in a must-win match on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.
“I’m very hopeful that we still have a chance to beat India in our next match. And then we will continue our match with Bangladesh,” Shoaib Malik said on Shoaib Akhtar’s YouTube channel.”
“Of course, morale is down. Confidence is down. But I think the character is still there.
“And we have that potential in our team to win against India. And I’m very hopeful. But now it’s their responsibility. The seniors will have to step up. Because it will be a pressure game. And for you, it’s a do-or-die game.
“Imagine if someone wins a game, do-or-die against India will become an instant superstar.
“So, I think opportunity is there. There is pressure, but opportunity. Take it as an opportunity,” he said.
Meanwhile, Shoaib Akhtar said Pakistan must play aggressive brand of cricket against India.
“I think my take is that rather than be on the defensive side play attacking cricket. I wish them best of luck against India,” he said.
“Overall, it was a very disappointing performance. If we look at the technical side, there are a lot of things.
“There should have been at least 5-6 bowlers. India, they play with 5-6 bowlers. They play more than that. They play with 7 bowlers. But again, I think the process of the planning is a bit lacking. And moving forward, I think now you’ve put yourself in a difficult spot.
“You’re in a must-win situation. I wish them best of luck.
“And hope you don’t make the same mistakes that you made against New Zealand and batted with such a low strike rate.
“If you had played it like a do-or-die game, it would have been different. If you had done good fielding, or if you had put in more effort in the fielding, then it would have been a different story.”

Title: Babar Azam has let Pakistan down: Ahmed Shehzad

Content:
Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has slammed Babar Azam for letting the nation down. Babar, who batted as an opener for Pakistan scored a scratchy 90-ball 64 as defending champions and hosts succumbed to a 60-run loss in the opening match of the Champions Trophy against New Zealand at National Stadium in Karachi.
“He was extremely under pressure,” Shehzad said on Geo News show “Haarna Mana Hai.”
“There is so much investment in Babar Azam. Where is he? Mulk ko unki jaroorat hai (The country needs him).
“The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has invested a lot on Babar. He was given a free hand as a captain for four and five years,” he said.
Babar completed his half-century in 81 balls, his one of his slowest fifty in the one-day cricket.
“You have played 52 dot balls. In the first 13 overs, Pakistan has played 60 dot balls. You lost the game there only,” said Shehzad.
“As a senior player Babar and Rizwan added 14 runs in 38 balls.
“You know that ball was turning and it was a double-paced wicket. So scoring with new ball was easy and your chance to put pressure on New Zealand. Babar didn’t showed any intent.
“For the past three years, he has not performed.
“In the T20 his game lagged behind. In 59 Tests he has played, Babar has only one player of the match award. The then coach Mickey Arthur did all in his power to establish him in the Test side.
“In the ODIs, where Babar used to own the format. He is struggling. The way he has played against New Zealand, he has dragged Pakistan,” he said.

Content:
Cheteshwar Pujara dissected Babar Azam’s inefficiency against the spinners during his 90-ball 64 against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy opener at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday. Defending champions Pakistan lost the match by 60 runs. They will now face arch-rivals India on Sunday in Dubai.
“There was no intent,” Pujara said on the show “Dressing Room.”
“Babar’s footwork against the spinner was not good. He was not using his feet. He was not reaching to the ball. He was waiting for the ball to come to him,” he said.
Show host Fakhr-e-Alam requested Pujara to give a masterclass. The right-handed batter showed how Babar struggled against the spinners.
“He was not committing. He was trying to flick the ball get a single, but there was a square leg fielder,” he said.
“He didn’t tried to play any sweep shot or a paddle sweep. Nowadays, reverse sweep is also an option to disturb the length of a spinner.
“It looks like there is a mental pressure on him.
“In one-day cricket, you need to bat with freedom, he is a natural stroke player. He needs to bat with more freedom. He needs to rotate strike and hit those odd boundaries. In the present time the strike rate of 70 and 80 are not good enough.
“You don’t need to play for your own runs.
“In one-day cricket you can’t be looking to save your own wicket instead you go to win the match.
“He was trying not to get out. But the dot balls added pressure on the batters, who came next.”
It was New Zealand’s third win over Pakistan in less than two weeks, the Kiwis having beaten the Rizwan-led side twice in the preceding tri-series.
The sole positive for defending champions Pakistan ahead of their clash against India was the performance of the lower-order with Khushdil Shah smashing 69 off 49 balls. Salman Agha also showed plenty of intent in his 42 off 28 balls but that urgency was missing in the approach of the top-order.

Content:
Wasim Akram has made a scathing attack on Pakistan batter Babar Azam, who scored a scratchy 64 off 90 balls against New Zealand in the opening game of the Champions Trophy at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday. Centuries from Tom Latham and Will Young propelled New Zealand to 60-run victory over defending champions Pakistan.
“I don’t want 60 off 90 balls from my main player,” pace legend Akram said on the show “Dressing Room.” “I’d rather have him getting 35 off 30 balls and get out instead of getting 64 of 90 balls. It’s not on in this day and age,” he said.
Akram went on to laud Salman Ali Agha, who scored a quickfire 42 off 28 balls.
“Babar was the set batter but it was Salman who was taking the risk,” said Akram.
Mohammad Rizwan in the post-match production rued the fact that they didn’t have the right momentum at the backend of the bowling innings and at the start of the chase, the latter due to Fakhar Zaman’s unavailability to bat for a stipulated amount of time, due to an injury he picked up in the afternoon. It was only compounded by the fact that Babar Azam was on 12 off 27 balls after the first 10 overs, with Pakistan on 22/2. It wasn’t even a case of accelerating after getting set, as Babar didn’t score a single boundary between overs 15.1 and 32. His final strike rate of 71.11 was nowhere near enough for Pakistan.
Babar’s struggling knock finally ended in the 34th over when he top-edged a sweep against Santner as Pakistan continued to lose wickets with regular intervals before eventually getting bowled out with 16 balls to spare.

Title: When Team India visited Pakistan in 2004, PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee told players: ‘Dil jeetke aana’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/atal-bihari-vajpayee-message-to-team-india-pakistan-tour-2004-9845353/
Content:
India vs Pakistan: Pakistan are the hosts of the ongoing Champions Trophy tournament in what is the country’s first major ICC event since 1996, when it co-hosted the Cricket World Cup with India and Sri Lanka. While seven of the eight teams will play their games in Pakistan, India will play all their games in Dubai after refusing to travel to Pakistan for security and political reasons.
The two teams have ceased bilateral cricket ties since the Mumbai terror attacks. The Indian team has not visited Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held there. Pakistan last hosted the Indian cricket team for a bilateral series in 2006.
India’s refusal to visit Pakistan brings back memories of the rare visits that the Indian team made to Pakistan, especially the tour of 2004. The tour of 2004 was a unique one, because India had not visited the neighbouring country for over a decade. There was also tension between the two nations over the Kargil War of 1999. The Indian team that went to Pakistan for the 2004 tour had legends like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble. Pakistan had stalwarts like Inzamam ul Haq, Mohammad Yousuf, Shoaib Akhtar and Saqlain Mushtaq.
But what stood out in that tour of 2004 was the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s keenness that the team “win hearts” in Pakistan.
“Before we left for Pakistan, we met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He told us, this is a ‘friendship tour’. Aap jeeto ya haaro khel main mujhe nahi maalom. Wahaan jao, toh dil zaroor jeetke aana Pakistani aavam ki (You win or lose in cricket, it doesn’t matter to me. But when you go there to Pakistan, win the hearts of Pakistani people),” Sehwag said in a recent Netflix documentary called ‘The Greatest Rivalry: India vs Pakistan’.
The Indian team landed in Pakistan under heavy security.
“It was a very bold move on the part of Atal Bihari Vajpayee to go ahead with the tour because of the threats we could face over there,” recounts Yashovardhan Azad, who was the head of security delegation.
Sourav Ganguly, who was the captain of the team, revealed the uncertainty in the team about travelling to Pakistan.
“Some players were in two minds about visiting there. Wahaan pe kya hoga? (What will happen there?) But we were playing such good cricket at the time, the youngsters said, ‘Chalo yaar, hum itni acchi team hain, hum unko haraa denge. Pehli baar harayenge, Pakistan ko Pakistan main. (We’re in such good form, we’ll beat them. For the first team, we’ll defeat Pakistan in Pakistan). So that was the push for us to go there,” Ganguly said on the documentary.
What unfolded was an unforgettable experience for both teams and the fans.
India did win hearts, as instructed by PM Vajpayee. But they also won both the ODI and the Test series. India won the 5-match ODI series 3-2 and the 3-match Test series 2-1.

Title: Champions Trophy PAK vs NZ: Babar Azam’s go-slow, Glenn Phillips stunner and other first impressions

New Zealand beat Pakistan by 60 runs to make a strong start to their Champions Trophy campaign. It leaves Mohammad Rizwan’s team in a perilous position to qualify for the semifinals in a ICC tournament they are hosting after nearly three decades. Here are two key first impressions each from the match in Karachi.
If Kane Williamson was fit and available, he might not have played a Test in India last year. But Will Young, as the cliche goes, grabbed his chances with both hands, and emerged as the Player of the Series as New Zealand sealed a historic whitewash. So much so that he was left out of the Test XI when the former captain returned fit for a home series against England. At CT, if Rachin Ravindra was fit, perhaps NZ would have been forced to rethink Young’s place in the first XI. But with the left-hander still out, Young scored a superb century to set the base of NZ’s 320 in the tournament opener. It is a classy knock that should likely seal his place at the top for the remainder of NZ’s campaign.
If it was another fielder, one would perhaps put it down as a one-off. But when Glenn Phillips dives on a cricket field, you almost expect improbable catches to be taken. He has made it a habit around the field, but Phillips’ flying behind square is now a fielding genre of its own. On Wednesday in Karachi, Phillips had already made his impact lower down the order with the bat. He is a handy bowler too (and has kept wickets in the past as well). But if there is a cricketer in the world at the moment who can make it to a playing XI purely on his athleticism in the outfield, it is Phillips. He reiterated that with a stunning catch to dismiss Pakistan’s most dangerous batter at the moment, Mohammad Rizwan. “We kind of expect that from Glenn,” captain Mitch Santner said with a knowing smile at the end.
Mohammad Rizwan rued the fact that they didn’t have the right momentum at the backend of the bowling innings and at the start of the chase, the latter due to Fakhar Zaman’s unavailability to bat for a stipulated amount of time, due to an injury he picked up in the afternoon. It was only compounded by the fact that Babar Azam was on 12 off 27 balls after the first 10 overs, with Pakistan on 22/2. It wasn’t even a case of accelerating after getting set, as Babar didn’t score a single boundary between overs 15.1 and 32. His final strike rate of 71.11 was nowhere near enough for Pakistan.

At one stage it looked like Pakistan would suffer a massive defeat that would severely dent their net run rate. But the run-rate graphs for Pakistan got close to New Zealand’s when Khushdil Shah was smashing it around the park for his 69 off 49 balls. With his 10 fours and a six, the left-hander scored five more runs than Babar in just over the half number of deliveries faced. It briefly gave Pakistan some hope but more tangibly, at least ensured the NRR didn’t take a heavier beating. In this tournament’s format, that could have made the night even worse for the hosts. Khushdil just didn’t get the same platform that Phillips got earlier in the day from NZ’s top-order batters.

“Scoring hundreds at the top is the secret to success. Our top 4 is settled and experienced. They understand that between Top 4 batters one of us has to get a century. But in World Cup we chipped and didn’t have lot of hundreds and still got big totals. Everyone wants to chip and not look at individual milestones and every batsman has to do the job. If 7-8 of us think like that we will be in a good position,” Sharma said at his press conference.

The Rohit Sharma-led Indian team will begin their Champions Trophy campaign in earnest as they face off against a buoyant Bangladesh side at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. India are coming into the tournament after losing pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah to injury and will be looking towards their veteran pacer Mohammad Shami to lead the attack.

The Men in Blue are coming into the tournament after whitewashing a strong England side 3-0 with Rohit and Virat Kohli finding some semblance of form after their disappointing outing against Australia and New Zealand in the last two Test series. India are coming into the tournament with a spin-heavy attack and are likely to field 3 spinners and 2 pacers in the opening match.

Even though Harshit Rana impressed in his debut ODI series against England, the Kolkata Knight Riders pacer is expected to give way to Mohammad Shami and Arshdeep Singh in the lineup. With Shami’s variations expected to be aided by the Dubai pitch, India will most likely go with the Bengal pacer throughout the whole tournament. With Arshdeep’s propensity to take early wickets and death overs bowling skill, he is likely to get the nod ahead of Rana.
Kuldeep and Varun are the two specialist spinners in the Indian setup with the other three spin options being allrounders in Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. With the Men in Blue likely to start with three spinners, Axar and Jadeja are expected to make it to the team due to their batting skills. This leads to a toss up between Kuldeep and Varun with the former likely to get the nod because of his experience in ODIs and the latter suffering a little niggle.
India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh.

Bangladesh: Nazmul Hossain Shanto (c), Soumya Sarkar, Tanzid Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Jaker Ali Anik, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Rishad Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Nahid Rana

Title: WPL 2025 | UPW vs DC: Meg Lanning’s return to form a positive as Delhi Capitals leave it late to beat UP Warriorz
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-2025-upw-dc-meg-lanning-form-delhi-capitals-up-warriorz-9845332/
Content:
It’s been a strange old start to Delhi Capitals’ Women’s Premier League campaign. They huffed and puffed over the line, quite literally when it came to crossing the crease, against Mumbai Indians. They were off colour for large parts against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. And despite playing well for a significant amount of the match against the UP Warriorz on Wednesday in Vadodara, they once again left it uncomfortably late.
For a team that was arguably the strongest on paper before the tournament started, the start has been laboured, but having stumbled at the finish line for the first two years, maybe they are – as the cliche goes – looking to peak at the right time. And one of the more favourable signs in that regard was Meg Lanning’s most fluent knock of the tournament yet. With her signature off-side strokes, the captain struck a serene 69 off 49 balls, laced with 10 out of 12 boundaries coming on that side of the wicket, as DC beat UP Warriorz by 7 wickets to register their second win.
Sent into bat, UP Warriorz rode on opener Kiran Navgire’s quick-fire half-century to post 166/7. Lanning said later that with the start UPW had thanks to Navgire, she was expecting a much stiffer target to chase. But led by Annabel Sutherland’s 2/26 that saw her account for both the openers, DC pulled things back through the middle, even though Shweta Sehrawat and Chinelle Henry moved through the gears in the back overs, with the latter especially severe on Shikha Pandey.
The total was ultimately not enough as besides Lanning, Sutherland anchored the chase with a somewhat cagey 35-ball 41-run knock, before Marizanne Kapp’s crucial 29 not off 17 in the end. UPW were let down by their fielding once more, especially two fours conceded in the last over and a missed run out, which meant DC just crossed the finish line.
With 32 needed from the last three overs, Kapp brought the equation down by hitting Ecclestone for two consecutive boundaries. Then with 11 required off the last over, Sutherland struck two boundaries off Tahila McGrath to take her side home.

With this result, the Vadodara leg of WPL 2025 comes to a close. And from the early trends, DC would be happy to pick up two wins despite not playing their best cricket yet. Despite losing a fair share of starters from the last year, defending champions RCB have set the pace early on. MI have bounced back from a opening defeat too. But for UPW – and strugglers for last two years in Gujarat Giants  – the early signs are not good.

Title: Champions Trophy: Pakistan’s bewildering naivety leads to morale-crushing defeat against New Zealand
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-pakistan-morale-crushing-defeat-new-zealand-9845308/
Content:
The thousands that thronged Karachi’s National Stadium returned home heartbroken as New Zealand inflicted a crushing blow on the hosts in the Champions Trophy opener. It was not so about the margin of defeat (60 runs when hunting 320) as it was about the manner of the surrender. The lingering feeling would be that they lost not because they were the inferior side, but because New Zealand exuded a streak of clarity and purpose, as they always do, that the hosts couldn’t fathom.
There was a bewildering naivety about the defeat, in their inability to seize the moments and deliver the knockout blows, in their shuddering strategies, in their lack of exigency plans, or in their sheer stage fright. The enormity of the occasion, big-ticket cricket returning to the country after nearly three decades, swamped them. The disconsolate fans could reflect on individual brilliance, the splendour of Khushdil Shah’s shot-making, Salman Agha’s audaciousness, the life-affirming serenity of Babar Azam., the bark and bite of Naseem Shah, the magic of Abrar Ahmed’s finger-flickers. But Pakistan had only moments to cling on, a shard of optimism that they could bounce back and the balm of history that they channel their finest cricket when they start clutching at the straws.
Their victorious adversaries had more concrete outcomes to nurse title dreams. There is a sense of serene decisiveness, as though they are wearing panic-proof jackets; there is no temptation to project false bravado, no lofty ideologies or ideologues. They go with the flow, but with the awareness of the tides and currents of the water. Will Young, the cussed Test opener, didn’t panic when his placement deserted him. He would block a few balls, regather his wavering focus, and devise other methods to tick the run-rate along. The centurion, who laid the foundation for New Zealand, was not unfazed by Abrar’s variations, the carrom ball flicked with the ring finger, or the wrong’un that spat off the surface more than the skiddier leg-break.

As he does in Test cricket, he waited for the loose ball to wink by, whereupon he displayed a ruthlessness that his still boyish face masks. A clip off the legs, a bunt through covers, a slap through point—he executed those same strokes that had bred a majority of his runs in international cricket. Even the pulled maximum of Haris Rauf was not a statement of an aggressive intention, but just the coincidence of the right ball to pull at the right time.
A throwback charm embodied his batting. He batted at a pace more in tune with those in the mid-2000s than in the post-pandemic milieu. The strokes pleased, rather than marvelled. Here was a batsman resistant to the improvised imagination and daring impulses of post-modern batsmen. He found an ideal partner in Tom Latham, a veteran of many battles. His game is limited but he finds answers to every riddle posed to him. En route to his eighth ODI century, Latham relied on harnessing the pace of both the seamers and spinners, picking the region behind the square for a lion’s share of his 118.
He blossomed with his sweeps, employing those to dishevel the lengths of the spinners, especially Salman Agha. Latham would retreat to his nudge and nurdle mode, before in a sudden shift of mood, he would crunch a four or heave a six. Like Young, his strokes don’t live in memory—the flicked six of Naseem perhaps would—but even before bowlers realise, he would be strolling into his 60s. By the time you comprehend how he accrued those runs, he is in the 90s, batting almost run-a-ball.

Only after the pair built a sturdy house that they decided to quickly add a few more storeys. They could expend all their energy on setting the base, knowing fully well that they have Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell and Mitchell Santner down the order to flick on the afterburners. The roll of the dice fell on Phillips, who reeled out a pugnacious 61 off 39 balls, scoring the bulk of the 113 runs ransacked in the last 10 overs.
So irresistibly simplistic were New Zealand’s plans that Pakistan tried to copy them and failed magnificently. The priority was on preserving wickets and cashing in later, while batting steadily and eschewing risks. So conscious of conserving wickets that they eked out only 22 runs (trading two wickets) in the first 10 overs. From then on, Pakistan inevitably jostled to the heartbreak junction.

But even to reach there, they took a circuitous and confused road. Nothing embodied it more than the curious case of Fakhar Zaman. The swashbuckler opener sustained a muscular sprain when aborting a four near the fence of the game’s second ball, came later on in the innings and even grabbed a catch. But after the dozy start, worsened by the departure of Saud Shakeel and Mohammed Rizwan, he strode in with the purpose of lifting his team from the shambles. His will shone, but the body rebelled. He winced and grimaced, and wore an apologetic face every time he turned down a single or two. New Zealand’s spinners exploited his immobility by bowling either on the leg side or outside the off-stump, reducing their pace, floating the ball and suffocating him. Some of his gamble paid off, but he lived a charmed life. The 47-run stand with Babar stabilised Pakistan, but the 65 balls they consumed made the equation steeper and effectively a futile cause. Salman, Babar and Khusdhil infused fleeting hope, but the night would be one of heartbreak.

Title: Champions Trophy: Fate of Rohit Sharma-Gautam Gambhir era on the line
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-rohit-sharma-gautam-gambhir-fate-ind-vs-ban-9845159/
Content:
Not that India needs a reminder, but the tagline for the Champions Trophy ‘All on the line’ that is pasted all across the ground sums up what this tournament could be for India. When the Rohit Sharma-Gautam Gambhir era began this season, few would have foreseen that the Champions Trophy – coming just eight months after the T20 World Cup triumph — would turn into a tournament that could well define their way forward for many of their own.
After the turbulent Australia trip which laid bare the cracks in the team, the Champions Trophy could well be the face saving one or a tournament that pulls down the curtains for some. But as skipper Rohit Sharma reminded at the press conference, it is also worth mentioning to not mix the formats. Before becoming world beaters in T20s, it is in ODIs that India really showed significant signs of embracing a new aggressive brand of cricket. At the World Cup, the last 50-over ICC event, they were the team of the tournament, but only for Australia to come up better in the final.
Of course, a lot could be riding on this tournament for the likes of Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and the support staff led by Gautam Gambhir. But even in the absence of their most valuable player Jasprit Bumrah the mood in the camp nowhere showed signs of a team carrying any baggage. If anything, they were in a relaxed mood – may be most of it had to do with the bug that is going around in the team – choosing to have a relaxed training session on the eve of the match. Having had two training sessions since their arrival here on Friday, India had an off-day on Tuesday, and on Wednesday had it light sans any net sessions. Instead, they indulged in a bit of foot volley before the batsmen had a few underarm throwdowns in the outfield.
With the bowling unit, the scene was totally different. With Bumrah not around, India have chosen just three frontline seamers – Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana – for the tournament. Of the three, Arshdeep just played the lone match against England and unlike T20Is, he is yet to ascertain himself in the format. Rana, having made his debut against England, has struggled when it comes to bowling with the new ball. Which leaves India depending a lot on Shami who has been struggling for rhythm since his comeback from a lengthy injury lay-off.
“Shami has played only two games and then obviously a couple of T20s as well. All we wanted with Shami was to get back wearing the Indian colours more than anything else. Whether he gets wickets or not, that was completely immaterial for us at that point. We wanted him to get back to playing for India and he has done that and whatever I have seen of him so far looks perfectly fine. When you talk about an older player like Shami who has done the job over the years so many times for us, for them it is just about getting back to their rhythm and hopefully we can find some result early on in this tournament and help the team,” Rohit said.
Those hopes on Shami from Rohit are not without reasons. If anything, as former India player and UAE coach Robin Singh who is well versed with the conditions here, told this daily the pitch in Dubai tends to assist pacers like Shami who hit the seam and generate movement. When that happens there are few fast bowlers who could exploit the condition as good as Shami does. The thin resources on the seam-bowling front where Hardik Pandya is expected to increase his load.
In contrast, in the spin-bowling front, India have come here with the most rounded-attack. In Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar they have a variety that few teams could dream off. But their decision to pick five for the trip when the pitches have traditionally assisted seamers has raised a lot of questions.
And when Rohit was asked about the rationale to pick five, his response gave enough glimpse of India’s plans. “There are two spinners (Kuldeep Yadav and Varun), and the other three are all-rounders, so I am not looking at it as five spinners. Those three guys can bat and bowl,” Rohit remarked. “We work on our strengths, and those three guys (Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar) give a different dimension to our combination and add depth. That is why we wanted to get players with two skills rather than one.”
Having depth in batting and bowling is what India believe is the way to take this team to the next level as they want to build on the highs of the 50-over World Cup. With the top four all right handers and Rishabh Pant only around as cover, India plan to make the most out of Jadeja and Axar, who are in line to start here alongside Kuldeep. It means, Varun and Washington have to warm the bench for the time being.
With regards to Varun it is understood that India want to unleash him in the later half of the tournament. His inclusion will be based more on the opposition than the conditions as he has been allowed to work on his niggle that he sustained recently.

Given how the other teams are packed and India having the advantage of playing all their matches in Dubai, they look every bit prepared to add another ICC title to their name. They have arrived here with a clear blueprint. How far it works will decide how far they go in this tournament.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Priyank Panchal’s commanding hundred puts Kerala under pressure
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-priyank-panchals-century-kerala-pressure-gujarat-9845085/
Content:
A domestic semifinal, even if it were to involve the home side, would not be an enticing prospect for the otherwise cricket-loving Ahmedabad populace to make the testing march and climb inside the world’s biggest cricket facility.
Abhiraj, who recently returned to the city after a fair few years studying and plying his cricketing wares in North Middlesex in London, had his expectations firmly in check when he turned up to watch a “friend’s friend” play for Gujarat on day three of the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Kerala.
“If Axar Patel were to play this game for Gujarat, perhaps the turnout would be better. Unlike the County Championship games in England where you’d have a decent turnout despite a nominal fee, in India you need the big international names to turn up for domestic games to grab attention. In England, it’s part of the culture and the county games warrant serious interest,” Abhiraj tells The Indian Express from a stand where he is seated alone, adjacent to another where the concurrent number pressed back and forth between 10 to 20 men but never beyond.
Local boy Priyank Panchal was not surprised by the lack of a crowd-infused glamour to his masterful 29th First-Class century that nearly reduced Kerala’s stoicism and grit to pieces, even leaving the ever-lively dugout from the previous two days hushed and devoid of innovative expressions.
Between Panchal’s unusually animated roar to celebrate a special 23rd Ranji Trophy century in his 100th First-Class appearance for Gujarat and the Kerala slumber, the langurs were up from a prolonged siesta. The far blocks of the 1.3 lakh capacity ground made for an odd viewing on Monday when a solitary spectator was seen amidst a sea of orange. Hooting and gathering in huge numbers in the arc opposite Panchal’s attacking zones on the field, the aggressive langurs even split open a large suspended speaker on the top tier of the K Block stand.

While the furry tribe’s aggressive hoops and hoots reverberated through the stadium, Gujarat’s highest century-maker was grateful for the 20-odd fans who had gathered past the fence when he walked back putting his team on 222/1 in  71 overs at stumps, reducing Kerala’s cautiously built castle to within 235 runs.
“On a lighter note, at least these people turned out. Yahaan log aise hi aate hai, (in Ahmedabad you can only expect such low turnouts for a domestic game),” Panchal says with a helpless chuckle that would resemble the sweat-smiled chat emoji.
While a visibly well-fed ginger cat briefly appeared at the lunch break, Abhiraj had to make a gruelling walk out of the enormous Motera facility to grab a bite. Visibly jaded upon return, he wonders if a visit on the following days was worth it, even if it meant Gujarat had put on a contrasting riposte and nudged ahead of Kerala in the knockout race.
Kerala’s single-minded approach was handed a firm response by the hosts, assuring that there are always more ways than one to solve the multi-day cricket puzzle. Gathering only 39 to their overnight total with centurion Mohammed Azharuddeen (177 not out) running out of partners and options to smash boundaries against a spread-out nine-manned boundary circle, Kerala’s spin dreams were soon shunned by the devious pitch.
Despite using the heavy roller on day two in anticipation of a deterioration and crumbling of the roughs, the strip bound together as Panchal and his opening partner Aarya Desai (73) replenished the scoring rates above 3 rpo for the first time in the match.
“Two days out on the field gave us a good understanding of the pitch. We employed a similar tactic to Kerala in playing time but for us scoring runs were also equally important. We understood that the turn was only emerging from the two rough patches and not the pitch in general,” Panchal observed.
The left-right batting duo immediately got down to unsettling Kerala’s spin lynchpins Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate’s lengths, rarely allowing them to slip into a zone. Using the lush outfield in their stride during a 131-run association, Panchal and Desai employed nimble footwork and supple wrists to drive and drill the wobbly four-man Kerala attack. Though the scoring rates dipped after a crafty Desai was undone by a loosener that dragged back to the stumps off seamer Basil NP, the 34-year-old Panchal’s seasoned shoulders carried the momentum.
Dropping out from the national radar and carrying a slate of inconsistency in recent seasons has not ruffled Panchal’s big-game temperament. Vividly remembering his 149 from the semi-final the year Gujarat lifted their maiden title in 2016-17, Panchal said: “I know that I can counter any bowler and I have the experience. I was looking forward to a knockout game like this. It was important for me to contribute because some of the younger players could get carried away.”
Moments after local scribes raised doubts about the Ahmedabad accumulator raising the milestone with a boundary, Panchal lofted left-arm tweaker Sarvate over wide long-on for a rasping maximum. It was not an entirely new feeling for the seasoned opener for a fact. “Getting a 100 with a six? I think it might be the first time, but I’ve done it twice when I reached 195 or 196 for double hundreds,” he remarked.
Save for two of the 200 deliveries that brought the wicketkeeper into play, Panchal is well in the zone to double his shares with another milestone-crossing six on Thursday. If only Amdavad’s cricket lovers would come along to celebrate their long-serving gladiator reign at a desolate colosseum.

Brief Scores: Gujarat 222/1 in 71 overs (Priyank Panchal 117 batting, Aarya Desai 73) vs Kerala 457 all out (Md Azharuddeen 177 not out).

Title: I want to enjoy remaining years of my cricket career like a child: MS Dhoni
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ms-dhoni-remaining-years-in-cricket-enjoy-child-9845071/
Content:
It has been nearly six years since he walked away from international cricket but retirement from the Indian Premier League might not be imminent for the legendary MS Dhoni, who wants to enjoy playing cricket like a “child”.
The 43-year-old former captain, who led India to World Cup wins in 2011 (ODI) and 2007 (T20) along with the Champions Trophy triumph in 2013, last made his international appearance for the country in June 2019.
While Dhoni called time to his international career in August 2019, he continues to feature in the IPL for Chennai Super Kings who retained him ahead of the mega auction last year.
He will now play as an uncapped player, having spent more than five years as a retired player from international cricket.
“I’ve retired since 2019, so it will be quite some time. What I’ve been doing in the meantime is I just want to enjoy cricket for the last, whatever few years, you know, I will be able to play,” Dhoni’s said on Wednesday during the launch of his app powered by Single.id.
“I want to enjoy it, how I did as a child when I was in school. When I lived in a colony, 4 o’clock (in the afternoon) was sports time, so we’ll go and play cricket more often than not.
“But if the weather doesn’t permit, we used to play football. I want to play with the same kind of innocence… (but it is) easier said than done,” he added.
Dhoni said as an India player his focus was always to give his best for the country and everything else came second.
“For me as a cricketer, I always wanted to perform for the Indian cricket team because I’ve said that in the past also, that not everybody gets a chance to represent the country,” he said.
“For us as cricketers, whenever we went on to the big stage or whenever we were touring, there was a chance for us to win laurels for the country and so for me it was the country that always came first.” Dhoni advised young players to identify what is “good for you” and set the priorities right.
“You always need to figure out what is good for you. When I was playing, I made sure that cricket was a whole for me — nothing else mattered. What time I had to sleep? What time I had to get up? What impact it had on (my) cricket, that was the most important thing,” he said.

“You know, all the friendships, the fun, all those can happen later. There is a right time for everything and I felt if you are able to recognise that, that’s the best thing you can do (for yourself).”

Title: ‘Upbeat’ Bangladesh captain Shanto confident about home-like conditions to help his team against India in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/bangladesh-captain-shanto-home-conditions-india-champions-trophy-9845011/
Content:
On Wednesday as Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto sat for his first media briefing ahead of the Champions Trophy, he spent almost half it answering about their pacers. Out of those a majority were around Nahid Rana, their first 150kmph fast bowler, whose workload is the single most topic of discussion among cricket nerds back home. Shanto would give assurance that Rana is as excited and waiting to have a go against India’s top-order.
But not until they saw Rana at the ICC Academy nets did there was a collective sigh of relief. Of the eight teams in the Champions Trophy that also includes Afghanistan, which is making its maiden appearance in the tournament, it is Bangladesh that start as rank outsiders. Ranked No 9 in the rankings, they just sneaked into the tournament on the expense of Sri Lanka via better run-rate at the 2023 World Cup.
For the first time since 2007, Bangladesh have arrived for an ICC event sans Shakib Al Hasan, their estranged hero who was not so long ago the toast of the nation. Those were different times. Since the political change, a lot has changed in Bangladesh cricket as well. This is a totally different team, one that is more excited about its fast bowlers and is holding its breath in the hope that they will demolish opponents in the same manner opposition attacks used to prey on Bangladesh batsmen. When asked if the team is missing Shakib, Shanto’s reply was a curt no, which led to loud laughter among the travelling Bangladesh media contingent.
With Tamim Iqbal retiring and Mushfiqur Rahim in the final lap of his career, it is Rana who hails from northwestern town of Chapai Nawabganj, who is beginning to be the new poster boy of Bangladesh cricket. Having grown up playing tape-ball cricket, bowling fast came naturally to him. Of course, his action had to be remodelled, he evolved into a refined bowler, but one aspect of his bowling has remained the same – the pace. At the nets, he repeatedly beats batsmen for pace, a sight he clearly seems to enjoy. It is no wonder that Bangladesh are turning to him in search of a new direction in ODIs alongside fellow pacers Taskin Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib to go with Mustafizur Rahim.
This is a luxury that no Bangladesh captain has enjoyed in the past. “Yes, very happy,” Shanto said as to how fun it is to have a pacer who clocks 150kmph as part of his side. “I think in the last few matches he bowled really well and bowled fast. And when we see him bowling like this, it helps our whole bowling unit. And it motivates us how we can give opponents a lot of challenges. So that is one thing I really like. But what I want, he needs to be fit and he can continue his bowling form. I hope he will continue and we have got another two – three fast bowlers as well. So I hope they will continue their form,” he added.
However, going into the game, there are still concerns about Rana’s participation because of his workload.
For Bangladesh to stand a chance against India, a lot rides on their pacers’ effectiveness against some in-form batsmen. Over the last two years, beginning from the 2023 World Cup, India have made it a habit of taking on the attack from the word go. And given the inexperience of Bangladesh seamers, there is no reason for India to relook at the plans, especially if they bat first. Under sun, the surface at Dubai tends to get slower, which means scoring runs at the top becomes all the more important before the spinners come on.
That the pitches won’t be a high-scoring one also means Bangladesh would feel comfortable as it is largely similar to the conditions they get back home in Mirpur and Chattogram
“I’m not depending on the fast bowlers alone to be honest. We have a good balanced attack to suit these conditions. And against India, you need to do well in all three departments. We have beaten them in the past when playing at home. But the conditions here are not totally different. We are familiar with these conditions as well, so we are upbeat,” Shanto said.

With the team in transition, when it comes to batting, a lot depends on Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah Riyad who have to shield their young strokemakers around them. But Bangladesh know what they are up against. Since the 2023 World Cup, in a format where they are most comfortable, they have been struggling with just 4 wins in the last 12 matches and even lost a series to Afghanistan at Sharjah in November. Can they change it now?

Title: Vidarbha in driver’s seat despite Mumbai lower-order fightback in Ranji Trophy semi-final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/vidarbha-drivers-seat-vs-mumbai-lower-order-ranji-trophy-semi-9844997/
Content:
Yash Rathod, batting at No 5 and Askhay Wadkar after him, ensured Vidarbha remained in the driver’s seat despite the hosts facing turbulence early in their second innings against Mumbai. Day three of the Ranji Trophy semi-finals at the VCA Stadium in Jamtha witnessed a gritty approach, some cautious batting and moments of desperation to reach a safe zone. It started with Mumbai’s wicket-keeper opener Akash Anand producing a display of determination, and reaching his hundred, which gave the defending champions hope to remain in the game. Mumbai were all out for 270 runs with Vidarbha taking a 113-run first-innings lead.
Defending champion Mumbai, who resumed their innings at 188/7, saw their last three batsmen adding 82 runs. Anand and Tanush Koitan scored 67 of those runs, which enabled Mumbai to get closer to Vidarbha’s total of 383. Kotian was lucky to stay on when he was dropped in the fourth ball of the day and he ensured that Vidarbha regretted that error.
Mumbai looked to kill time and didn’t indulge in playing rash shots. They looked to play the ball with a straight bat. Anand, who was batting on 67 overnight, cashed in on the occasion of a Ranji semi-final to register his second first-class hundred.
The 29-year-old batsman had waited for years to get a place in this Mumbai squad. He wasn’t considered the first choice but with wicket-keeper Hardik Tamore failing to capitalise on his chances with the bat, the Mumbai team management decided to give him the opportunity. He had scored a ton in the league’s last game against Meghalaya, which cemented his place in the knock-outs. Anand was handy behind the stumps too as he picked off five catches. His father, a former club cricketer in Mumbai as well, wanted his son to take up sport. A batch mate of Shreyas Iyer in his school, Anand has had to wait a while to get this chance.
“I was part of the One-day team last year but didn’t get a chance to play. I’m a batch mate of Shreyas and Shams Mulani. I was extra motivated to do well especially when the situation demanded to stay at the crease,” he said after his marathon innings where he scored 106 off 256 balls.
Left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade, who had dented Mumbai’s middle-order, got Kotian wicket with a ball that travelled between bat and pad to hit the stumps. Anand and number ten Mohit Awasthi tried to hang around before Anand was caught behind while playing on off to medium-pacer Nachiket Bhute. Harsh Dubey got his second of the day as he got Awasthi bowled.
Mumbai would be pleased with the fightback from the tailenders but they could have expected more especially with the game heading towards a result.
Vidarbha didn’t get the best of the start as Shardul Thakur got opener Atharva Taide LBW on the second ball of the second innings. Mumbai took advantage and like the hosts, they too looked to build pressure by bowling tight lines. Danish Malewar looked in touch but couldn’t convert that start as he hit straight to Mulani and got caught. The left-arm spinner got Karun Nair leg before in quick succession and then three overs later opener Dhruv Shorey too lost his wicket to Kotian..
With 56 for 4, Mumbai hoped to wrap Vidarbha up early for a comeback in the game but Rathod and Wadkar ensured their side went wicketless thereafter. Like Mumbai, Vidarbha’s lower-order has contributed more with the bat in the second innings. As they both batted out the toiling Mumbai bowlers, a few veterans quipped that Vidarbha’s real batting order had begun only now. They didn’t give any opportunity to Mumbai and played each ball on its merit. Mumbai waited for one breakthrough – they even made their left arm quick Royston Dias bowl round the wicket but the change was unsuccessful. They added an unbeaten 91-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Rathod scoring back-to-back half centuries in this game.
Their innings has now ensured Vidarbha leading by 260 runs and they will hope to post a competitive total against a star-studded Mumbai line-up. With two more days to go, an interesting contest could be on the cards.

Brief scores: Vidarbha 383 & 147 in 53 overs (Yash Rathod 59 not out; Shams Mulani 2/50) lead Mumbai 270 all out in 92 overs (Akash Anand 106; Parth Rekhade 4/55) by 260 runs.

Title: ‘There only two spinners, the rest are all-rounders’: Rohit Sharma before India’s match vs Bangladesh in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-2-spinners-allrounders-ind-vs-ban-champions-trophy-9844918/
Content:
India skipper Rohit Sharma said on Wednesday that the team has selected 2 spinners while the other three players were all allrounders when he was asked about picking 5 spinners for the Champions Trophy. Varun Chakaravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav are the two specialists spinners while the other options in that department are Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar, who all are very capable batters.
“There only two spinners, the rest are all-rounders. They can bat and bowl. We play to our strengths. The three all-rounders give a different dimension to the squad, they add a lot to the squad. We wanted to have players with two skills rather than one,” said Rohit ahead of the tournament opener against Bangladesh in Dubai.
India also have three fast-bowling options in the form of Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana with Hardik Pandya being the sole pace all-rounder.
On the event taking place after eight years, Rohit added: “It is a very important tournament like all ICC events are. We have to do lot of things right to hold the trophy.”
The Men in Blue will not be travelling to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy and will play all its matches in UAE. India will take on Bangladesh in the first game of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy and will play Pakistan on Sunday.

India and Pakistan are joined in Group A by New Zealand and Bangladesh for the Champions Trophy. The tournament started on Wednesday with the opening match between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand.

Title: PAK vs NZ: Is Kiwis’ score of 320 further proof that Champions Trophy will be dominated by batters?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pak-vs-nz-kiwis-320-score-champions-trophy-batters-9844866/
Content:
If the 2025 Champions Trophy had been expected to be won by the batters, a reminder of why that may be the case was served on the opening day itself.
Put into bat first after Pakistan won the toss, New Zealand’s total reached 320 for 5, after a well-paced first innings, led by centuries from Will Young and Tom Latham, in Karachi on Wednesday.
It was the sixth 300+ score in the last nine ODI innings played on Pakistani soil after the recent tri-series between these two teams and South Africa. Across those four matches, there had been five hundreds and 15 50+ scores.
That trend is not new either. Since 2021, according to ESPNCricinfo, Pakistan has been home to the highest batting average in ODIs (35.53) in the world.
“Although the totals might seem high in the context of cricket it’s probably on par to get 320 these days when batting first and chasing it down in the 44th or 46th over,” South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo, adding that the “conditions are in favour of the batters”. The Proteas leaked 300+ scores in each of their matches in the tri-series, even failing to defend a mammoth total of 355 against Pakistan.
So, if belters are expected to be rolled out during the tournament, how can the bowlers take control of the game? Being economical in the middle overs, according to Maharaj.
“In order to get success, it’s about building pressure and just limiting the boundary balls in between,” he said. “It’s not about changing the way I bowl, it’s just about changing the field sets that we have. I’m still trying to bowl my best ball to create opportunity, but with probably a more defensive type of field, maybe not carrying a slip for so long. That’s basically the sort of mindset.”
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s three spinners – Abrar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah and Salman Agha – conceded 102 runs across their 20 overs, far more economical than their pacers, who were hammered in the death.

The tweakers may well have kept them in the running and the second innings target, while high, within reach. And that may be the key on the batting-friendly pitches in this tournament.

Title: ‘I have always liked this tournament; it represents consistency’: Virat Kohli on Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-likes-champions-trophy-consistency-format-9844791/
Content:
India batting stalwart Virat Kohli said to Star Sports that he has always liked the Champions Trophy as a tournament because it ensures that the participants have to be at their best from the beginning to have any chance of qualifying for the next round. With less number of matches, the Champions Trophy offers little scope for errors with one defeat might become very costly in the scheme of things.
“The tournament is happening after a long time. I have always liked this tournament. It represents consistency as you have to be in the top 8 of the rankings (to qualify). The level of competition is always good,” Kohli said.
“In ODI format, it creates the pressure of a T20 World Cup. There also you have three or four games in the league stage. If you don’t start well, you are under pressure. The pressure is from the first game itself and that is why I like it, you have to be at your best from game one,” he added.
Kohli has played three editions of the 50-over event in 2009, 2013 and 2017 and will take to the field for his fourth straight edition of the tournament when India take on Bangladesh on Thursday in Dubai.
India will play their remaining league games against Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2. While the tournament host is Pakistan, India will be playing all the games in Dubai as part of the event’s hybrid model.

Kohli will be aiming for a bagful of runs in the tournament after a tough Test tour of Australia. He was back amongst the runs in the preceding ODI series against England, scoring a half-century in the final game in Ahmedabad.

Title: ‘Does he play for India’: A dejected Hasan Ali questions PCB over biases in injury management and giving VVIP treatment to Saim Ayub
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/does-he-play-for-india-dejected-hasan-ali-alleges-pcb-of-giving-vvip-treatment-to-saim-ayub-9844713/
Content:
2017 Champions Trophy player of the tournament, Hasan Ali, has come out attacking Pakistan Cricket Board management over the preferential treatment given to him during his injury and giving VVIP treatment to young opener Saim Ayub.
While Ayub, who was injured while playing against South Africa in January, underwent an operation in England and is recovering, Ali spent more than 16 months in rehabilitation in 2020 and has questioned the partial attitude of PCB against players.
“Saim Ayub is injured. He is a player of Pakistan team. I was not a player of the Pakistan team in 2020? If any other Pakistani player gets injured, he is not part of the team? Does he play for India? They are giving VVIP treatment to Saim Ayub. If anybody else gets injured, will they do the same for him? May god give good health to Saim. But when he gets injured again, will he get the same treatment? They will not give. We have to rectify this,” Hasan Ali told the podcast Ultra Edge.
The pacer, who was the player of the tournament in the 2017 Champions Trophy, had suffered a back injury in 2019, followed by a stress fracture in the ribs and subsequent elevated disc injury leading to an operation and sidelining him for more than 16 months in the following years. Ali then made a return to the Pakistan team during the Test series against South Africa at home in January 2021. Since then, he has played in 15 Test matches, 13 ODIs and 21 T20Is for Pakistan but missed out on a spot in the Pakistan team for the Champions Trophy. “The most painful thing during the injury was that my physio was changed every month. When our national team physio used to work with me some days, it would be okay, but when I would return to NCA, the story would be the same. This is for the whole 16 months and not for one month or two months. Whenever I used to recover, my physios would be changed, and it would be back to where I was. I did not know whether it was a slipped disc and was told it was a spasm initially. And then the stress fracture to the ribs happened, which worsened the problem,” remembered Ali.
The 30-year-old cricketer, who has played in 24 Tests, 66 ODIs and 51 T20I for Pakistan till present, believes that Pakistan cricket needs stability in terms of players as well coaches, referring to former Indian coach Rahul Dravid as the perfect example to follow.

“There is a lack of stability. I have seen many players in my eight years of international career who get out of the team without playing a single game. A team takes 3-4 years to build, and then after 8-9 years, the players have their downs too. But then one has to be sure about the plans. The biggest example is former Indian coach Rahul Dravid. India lost the ODI World Cup at home. They played fantastic till the final. And Rahul Dravid said goodbye after they won the T20 World Cup. In Pakistan, we remove coaches or players before the World Cup. Do we call this stability,” said Ali.

Pakistan talisman Babar Azam was dethroned from the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings by India vice-captain Shubman Gill on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana found himself on top of the Men’s ODI bowling rankings, surpassing Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan. This is not the first time that Shubman finds himself on top of the ICC standings: he had also left Babar Azam behind midway through the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2023.

Shubman’s rise to the top of the standings comes right before India’s Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh in Dubai and India’s much-anticipated clash with arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday. He has been in fine form recently, scoring two fifties and a century in the recent three-match ODI series against England at home which India won 3-0.
“It’s a major shake-up at the top of the rankings just prior to the start of the Champions Trophy and leaves an interesting sub-plot to what will transpire over the coming weeks during the eight-team tournament in Pakistan and Dubai,” the ICC said in a statement. “This is the second time Gill has held the No.1 ranking in ODI cricket, with the India batter having also gone past Babar to claim top spot midway through the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2023. Gill has been in excellent form of late, with his century against England in Ahmedabad during the third ODI of the recently concluded series enough to catapult the 25-year-old to the top of the rankings.”

Title: Milind Rege, his love for Mumbai cricket and why I won’t be there at his funeral: Sunil Gavaskar
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/milind-rege-love-for-mumbai-funeral-sunil-gavaskar-tribute-9844709/
Content:
Milind Rege was like my elder brother and yet, I won’t be at his funeral. I just won’t be able to bear the sight of his still body.
Even though I knew it was coming as I met him at the hospital yesterday before leaving for Dubai for the Champions Trophy. He kept offering his hand for me to shake as if he knew we weren’t going to do it again. I told him that I shall see him on the 22nd morning and he gave me a weak smile.
As I said, he was like my brother. We lived in a building across from each other, grew up together, played tennis-ball cricket in the compound; we even went to the same school and college.
He played Ranji Trophy cricket for his beloved Mumbai, ahead of me. He always came to the team’s rescue when we, the so-called top order, failed. Just like how Shardul Thakur, Tanish Kotian, and Shams Mulani have done it for Mumbai this season; Rege was our man for crisis. He was good enough to play for India but there was Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkatragavan around and he couldn’t break in.
Then, at the age of 24, he had his first heart attack. It speaks volumes of his love for Mumbai cricket and his determination that he made a comeback a few years later. He even captained Mumbai.
Last week, after he was first admitted to the hospital, I told him that Mumbai had taken a small lead against Haryana – you could see how he immediately perked up. Mumbai cricket was his life. Yes, he had strong opinions and that might have upset a few people but no one could question his love, commitment to Mumbai cricket.

We have known each other since we were a few months old. That’s why I won’t be able to bear the sight of his body at the funeral. It may sound selfish on my part but I genuinely won’t be able to take in the last rites of my elder brother.

Title: ‘We were not seeing whom we were facing in the final’: Hasan Ali recalls 2017 CT final triumph

Content:
With less than four days to go, when the Rohit Sharma-led Indian team faces arch-rivals Pakistan in a group match of the Champions Trophy in Dubai on February 23, hosts Pakistan will be taking inspiration from their 2017 final triumph against India. It was Pakistan’s first and remains Pakistan’s only win against India in an ICC tournament final to date. Pacer Hasan Ali, who was the player of the tournament with 13 wickets, recalled how the Sarfaraz Ahmed-led Pakistan team did not fear the then Virat Kohli-led Indian team ahead of the final at The Oval.
“We as a team had no fear in the final. We had reached that situation where we were not seeing whom we were facing in the final. Our eyes were only on the trophy. A day before the final, Sarfaraz bhai told the whole team that it was his wish that the team get to wear the Champions blazer. The feeling is different from wearing that blazer. He gave us the example of how India and other teams achieved that in the past, and it’s his biggest wish now. And I am glad that each one of us played his part in that title triumph,” said Ali while speaking on the podcast Ultra Edge.
The Gujranwala-born Ali came into the tournament a year after his ODI debut. Then, the 22-year-old picked up a total of 13 wickets in five matches at an average of 14.69. In the final against India, Ali picked up three wickets, including MS Dhoni and was adjudged the player of the tournament.
Ali termed getting the player of the tournament trophy from former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly as one of his cherished memories. “Honestly, I never thought that I would become that impactful player for Pakistan in the tournament,t and I will get the player of the tournament trophy from Sourav Ganguly. When we were in the West Indies before the Champions Trophy, our bowling coach, Azhar Mahmood, told me that such moments rarely come in life. You are going to play in your first ICC tournament, put in your best effort, and give everything. I told him that I would try my best. The win was the result of the hard work of all of us,” said Ali.
Pakistan had started their campaign with a 124-run loss against India at Edgbaston but then won their next four matches, including the semi-final against England, followed by the 180-run win over India in the final.

Ali also shared how things changed after the loss against India. “We can never describe the feelings in words after winning the trophy. We were at number eight in the world ranking and lost our first match against India. We had a good meeting with coach Mickey Arthur after that loss. Even though I could not understand a single word of him speaking in English, we could sense from his face what he was trying to say. Later, Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez bhai translated his words and said, ‘Sheron ki tarah khelna hai’. And we played like that,” said Ali.

Title: New Zealand’s Will Young scores first century of 2025 Champions Trophy in match vs Pakistan
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/will-young-first-century-100-champions-trophy-2025-pak-vs-nz-9844536/
Content:
New Zealand’s Will Young became the first centurion of the 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy as he kept the Pakistan bowlers at bay in the opening match in Karachi on Wednesday. The Kiwi batter took 107 deliveries to reach his 100 in an innings peppered with 11 fours and 1 six.
Young survived nervy moments before crossing past the century mark, particularly when there was a run out shout against him when he was on 87. But the replays showed he had crossed the crease comfortably. Then again, when he was on 99, he was out of his crease at the non-striker’s end when the throw missed the stumps, much to his relief.
Young was a stabilising force for the Black Caps, when they lost three wickets early. Two of those wickets — New Zealand’s first two, Devon Conway and Kane Williamson — fell in the span of five deliveries. Young probably would have sat this one out if Rachin Ravindra had been fit.
Earlier, Pakistan’s 29-year wait to host a major International Cricket Council tournament ended on  Wednesday when it won the toss and elected to field in the Champions Trophy opener against New Zealand.
Pakistan is the defending champion after beating archrival India in the final when the Champions Trophy was last played in 2017.
The 1996 World Cup, co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka, was the last time Pakistan staged a major ICC event.
New Zealand is on a high and is quite familiar with the conditions at the newly upgraded Karachi stadium after winning the tri-nation series last week against Pakistan and South Africa.
Despite losing two frontline fast bowlers, Lockie Ferguson and Ben Sears, due to injuries, New Zealand has shaped up well for the Champions Trophy with all the top-order batters among runs. And the Black Caps spinners, led by Mitchell Santner’s left-arm spin, have contained the opposition well in the middle overs.
New Zealand also missed opening batter Rachin Ravindra for the opening game as the left-hander is still recovering from a blow on the forehead sustained during the tri-nation series opener at Lahore — one of the three cities hosting the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.
Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf, who missed the last two games of the tri-nation series because of a side strain, passed a fitness test and was recalled in place of allrounder Faheem Ashraf.

New Zealand, which won the inaugural edition of the tournament in 1998, has won all its previous three Champions Trophy games against Pakistan in 2000, 2006 and 2009.

The pitch at Dubai International Cricket Stadium is known for conditions that could pose a challenge for both batters and bowlers. Media reports from Dubai state that fresh pitches will be in use for this encounter. This will mean the 22-yard strip could offer pace early on, while also assisting spinners in the middle phases.
Weather conditions for Dubai on the day India play their Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh are expected to be warm and dry with some early cloud cover. As the game unfolds, dew is expected to play a role. This means that the team bowing second will be at a disadvantage.

Pakistan last hosted an ICC event in 1996 when they joined hands with India and Sri Lanka to host the Cricket World Cup. Since then, the terror attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team has made tours by cricketing nations to Pakistan scarce.

The hosts are under pressure because they were eliminated in the group stage in the last two ICC tournaments. What made matters worse was that at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 — where arch-rivals India won the title — Pakistan endured a humbling defeat to the USA.

But Babar insists that there is no pressure on the team about past failures.
“There is no pressure of anything. What has happened in the past is beyond us. We have discussed mistakes we have made and we have worked on them,” Babar was quoted as saying by the ICC website. “When you have responsibility as a senior player in any team and the team relies on you and has belief in you, then I take it in a positive way.”

Babar also said that the team will draw comfort from being the hosts.
“When you play at home you get that edge as you know the conditions,” he said. “You have a knowledge of how the pitch will behave, both in the first and second (innings), but still you have to play good cricket because all other teams are among the best. It means a lot to be hosting the competition.”

Title: R Ashwin on Champions Trophy: ‘Salman Agha could become poster boy for Pakistan cricket’

As hosts Pakistan face New Zealand in their Champions Trophy opener at the National Stadium in Karachi today, the defending champions would hope to emulate their 2017 title-winning campaign. The Mohammad Rizwan-led Pakistan team has included talents like Tayaab Tahir and Salman Agha in the squad and former Indian spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin believes that Salman Agha can be the poster boy for Pakistan cricket with a dominating performance in Champions Trophy.

Agha has so far played in 33 ODIs with one hundred and five half-centuries under his belt and his maiden ODI hundred came last week against South Africa during the tri-nation series. “I am excited about two players. Tayyab Tahir and Salman Ali Agha. What a player Salman Agha is. He has quality and press handling ability. I am seeing a Pakistani player with on field presence for the first time in many years. I really hope he does not go like some of the other players did. He could become the poster boy for Pakistan cricket. I believe he has so much ability that he can surpass Babar Azam and Rizwan. I am not sure about his real age but I am a fan of his game. He has the skill to play all kinds of shots,” Ashwin said on his YouTube show Ash ki Baat.

2017 Champions Trophy player of the final Fakhar Zaman too has made a comeback into the Pakistan side in recent months and is expected to open for the hosts. Zaman amassed 135 runs in the recently held tri-nation series including a knock of 84 runs against New Zealand. Ashwin sees Zaman opening for Pakistan in the Champions Trophy partnering Babar Azam. “I am glad Fakhar Zaman is back. As their team is setting up, it seems that Babar Azam and Fakhar Zaman will open and Saud Shakeel and Rizwan will play at three and four. And Tayyab Tahir will be the one to watch out in the middle-order. Their approach has been different than India to have more pacers in the team and let’s see what happens next,” added Ashwin.

Pakistan have only included leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed as the sole specialist spinner in the Champions Trophy squad. With Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah along with Haris Rauf expected to lead the Pakistan bowling attack, Ashwin put his weight behind Afridi and Ahmed if Pakistan have to win the title. “Shaheen Shah Afridi. What can he do? Can Abrar Ahmed be the answer to what Pakistan has been looking to? All these things will contribute to where Pakistan will finish in the Champions Trophy,” said Ashwin.

Title: ‘Indian cricket team much more relaxed when playing Pakistan’: R Ashwin on India vs Pakistan

With India and Pakistan set to face each other in the Champions Trophy at Dubai on February 23, it will be the sixth time that the two archrivals would play against each other in a Champions Trophy game. While Pakistan had won the 2017 Champions Trophy with a ten-wicket win over India, the Rohit Sharma led Indian team will be eying to score their third win over Pakistan in Champions Trophy. In ICC Tournaments including World Cup, T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy, India has won 16 matches out of 21 matches with just four losses and former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has shared that the current Indian team does not play under any pressure while facing Pakistan.

“At present, whenever India and Pakistan play against each other, the Indian team is not under that much pressure as compared to what Pakistan team experiences. The Indian team is much more relaxed when there is a match against Pakistan at present. The Pakistan team is under much more pressure and it is visible as one sees their players. It seems that they are playing under a lot of pressure. It’s a bit sad but I think this Pakistan team has the quality and they can do something. If it’s their day, they can outperform India,” said Ashwin on his Youtube channel Ash ki Baat.

The Indian team will be playing all its group matches in Dubai with their opening match against Bangladesh on Thursday. The match against Pakistan on February 23 will be followed by the Indian team facing New Zealand on March 2 and Ashwin sees the toss playing a big role in Dubai. With two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals, Ashwin has put his weight behind India, New Zealand, South Africa and England to be the semi-finalists in Champions Trophy.

“This Indian team is a champion material team. I only have my reservations about five spinners in the squad. This is the team that has got the meat to be champions and there is a chance to win an ICC tournament for the second consecutive time. “It’s an early call. But I feel that if India wins the toss twice in Dubai, then India or New Zealand playing in the final is the highest. This is an early call but I think India will be in the final. My four qualifying teams will be India, New Zealand, New Zealand and South Africa. Afghanistan has got an outside chance. Champions Trophy has always seen surprises,” concluded Ashwin.

Title: Cricket: Ex-Mumbai captain Milind Rege dies at 76, players wear black armbands in Ranji Trophy match
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/cricket-mumbai-captain-milind-rege-dies-black-armband-ranji-trophy-9843899/
Content:
Former Mumbai captain Milind Rege passed away on Friday morning at 76 after suffering cardiac arrest. Rege played multiple roles in Mumbai cricket since he retired from the sport, remaining available for Mumbai Cricket Association throughout his cricketing career. He served as a managing committee member, was a selector, commentator and later was appointed as advisor to MCA.
Ahead of the day’s play in Nagpur in the Ranji Trophy semifinal, Mumbai and Vidarbha players observed silence as a mark of respect. The Mumbai players wore blacka armbands as well.
Rege, an offspinner, played 52 first-class matches for Mumbai in the 70s and took 126 wickets. He was also part of the organising committee during ICC-Champions Trophy held in Mumbai in 2006.
Former India cricketer Sandeep Patil said Rege was the support system of his life. “At my book release, he said see you in Kolkata, I was waiting for him to visit me. He played a very very important role in my life on and off the field, he and his wife Raj stood behind me in my trying times. Mumbai has lost its biggest supporter, his contribution in helping and building the careers of young talents will remain unmatched. He remained loyal to Dadar Union, CCI, and MCA. Even in his late days he always wanted to be part of Mumbai Cricket as a long-serving selector and Administrator. I will keep missing him,” the former India chief selector said.
Really sad to hear about the demise of a dear friend Milind Rege. A true Champion in his contribution to Mumbai and Tata's cricket all-round. A Mentor Par Excellence. Heartfelt condolences to Raj and family. God bless his soul. pic.twitter.com/ZrB1fHAizg

Diana Edulji, former Indian captain and advisor to MCA along with Rege, said he would never miss any meeting until the last one, where he had an appointment scheduled with his doctor. “He was a good cricketer in his days. He was not feeling well lately and the only meeting he missed was the last one. He always came up with good ideas and he believed in discipline during the meeting. He was never afraid of speaking his mind. He will come well prepared with all his notes written. He knew the performance of each player and coach,” Edulji said.
MCA president Ajinkya Naik recalled how he wished Mumbai does well in the Ranji Trophy before getting admitted to the hospital for a routine check-up. “He called and said I am going for a routine check-up and won’t be available for the MCA selection meeting for Ranji Trophy semis. He never missed any meetings and he was so passionate about Mumbai that his last line was ‘I hope Mumbai clinches the  Ranji Trophy title this time too’. He just wanted Mumbai to do well in every section of the game,” Naik recalled.
For MCA and BCCI administrator Ratnakar Shetty praised Rege’s versatility to wear many hats. “I have known him since his playing days. He came back to active cricket after a heart surgery. He always made it to watch Mumbai Ranji games. I last spoke to him when we won the quarter-finals against Haryana. I salute him.”

Pakistan and New Zealand are facing each other once again after the recent Tri-Series final at the National Stadium in Karachi, the same venue where the Kiwis outclassed the hosts and won the Tri-Series trophy last Friday. This time around though, they will be facing off in the opener of the Champions Trophy with the stakes much higher. Pakistan won the toss in the first game of the ICC Champions Trophy and opted to bowl first.

The Black Caps who have won the last two ODIs against Pakistan will be pretty confident on repeating the feat once again with most of the players firing on all cylinders. Pakistan, meanwhile, have been buoyed by the return of Haris Rauf who couldn’t take part in the Tri-Series due to injury.

The pitch at the National Stadium has always been a high scoring venue with an average first innings score of 289 runs. At the early portions of the day, pacers are expected to find assistance from the surface but in a balancing act, the batters are also expected to run riot. As the day progresses, however, the spinners will get purchase from the ground and grow into the match.

The weather at the National Stadium is expected to be conducive to cricket with Accuweather predicting a mostly cloudy and very warm conditions in the morning which will turn to breezy in the afternoon.

IN DUBAI, the city of endless possibilities, home to expatriates, cricket teams of India and Pakistan will kick-start a new arrangement with the Champions Trophy. India will be holed up here while Pakistan play at their home.
If India hosts an ICC tournament next, India will be playing at home, while Pakistan will find itself in Dubai.
Up until 2027, both teams with storied history — which can’t avoid facing each other in global events because of the revenue they generate – will play each other only at neutral venues. The first of such fixtures is scheduled for Sunday, with thousands expected to fly down from world over for the cricketing El Clasico.
Champions Trophy 2025, PAK vs NZ LIVE Cricket Score: Watch Here
“It’s quite sad that it has come to this,” Mudassar Nazar, a Pakistan veteran of many battles against India at home, away, and in neutral Sharjah, laments.
“More than the players, it is the public who will miss out on the biggest fixture in cricket,” he tells The Indian Express. “There are millions who are waiting to see Kohli and Bumrah play in Lahore and they would spend big money to watch them in flesh. The soul of this contest is the fans – a neutral venue can never match that. In the 2023 World Cup, we all saw how well the Pakistan team was received by Indian fans. Those moments will stay with everyone – fans and players.”
PAK vs NZ LIVE Cricket Score, Full Scorecard: Watch Here
After the Indian government’s refusal to send the team to Pakistan, which is the actual host with Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi splitting 9 matches among them, the rest of the fixtures involving India will take place in Dubai.
This is a peak tourist season in Dubai, where the locals are being overwhelmed with endless festivals — with Ramadan around the corner — and the India vs Pakistan cricketing clash undoubtedly adding more excitement.
While India and Pakistan squaring off in the UAE is not new, there is a whole different feel to it this time. In big tournaments, where at least one India vs Pakistan match is guaranteed these days, the expectation from both sides of the border has always been about wanting more, a dream final. When the Champions Trophy was last played in 2017, the final between the two at The Oval was the icing on the cake for the hosts and organisers.
However, this time, such a dream run is Pakistan’s worst nightmare waiting to happen. If India goes all the way to the final, the business end of the Champions Trophy will take place in Dubai and thereby rob Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium a chance to host its biggest game ever since Arjuna Ranatunga’s daredevils humbled the Aussies in the 1996 ODI World Cup.

Even from an organisers point of view, this hybrid model, brings its own share of challenges. Match officials from India – umpire Nitin Menon and match referee Javagal Srinath – have decided against travelling to Pakistan. When India hosts ICC events in future, the same can be expected from Pakistan’s end.
Even plans for a captains’ photoshoot, which was in the pipeline, never materialised as it had to happen without Rohit Sharma. And for the final, which could either take place in Dubai or Lahore, it is understood that two different guest lists are being prepared for the prize distribution ceremony with the ICC Chair Jay Shah unlikely to travel to Pakistan. If the final takes place in Lahore, it is likely to be headlined by their head of state.
If all of this doesn’t complicate, adding to the intrigue is the weather in Dubai which has witnessed scattered showers over the past couple of days. It has led to the locals fearing a repeat of the 2024 floods, which brought the city to a standstill. On Tuesday, the square remained under covers before a heavy evening spell lashed the Dubai Sports City, where the stadium is situated. With India picking five spinners and just three seamers, gloomy conditions could thwart all their plans.
On Wednesday, when Pakistan take on New Zealand at Karachi in the opening fixture, their shoulders would definitely weigh a lot heavier with the burden of expectations. For if they get off on the wrong foot, India has a chance to make it worse on Sunday and all of Pakistan’s worst fears could come true. Given the magnitude of the contest, several are already heading to Dubai with the expectations being sky high.
Absence of Bumrah
With a strong squad at their disposal and despite the absence of Jasprit Bumrah, India have a chance to spoil the moment that Pakistan has been waiting for nearly 30 years. And with Pakistan also not looking in the best of form in recent times, those fears are not misplaced. On YouTube, several of Pakistan players are already questioning their selection, wondering how they will even face a strong Indian side with just one specialist spinner.
A couple of Pakistan cab drivers in Dubai even ask a pointed question, “What is Faheem Ashraf doing in this team? Where is the chacha (Iftikhar Ahmed)? This team is ruined because of board politics,” one alleges. “I’ve previously seen them play here, but not this time,” says another fan.
In 2023, a sleepy town of Pallekele came to a standstill and so did the Big Apple in 2024. Neutral venues to both these teams isn’t new. But only this time, it adds new plot to this age-old rivalry.

Pakistan will breathe a sigh of relief with the inclusion of Haris Rauf in their Playing XI after the player had missed the remainder of the Tri-Series due to an injury suffered during the first match between Pakistan and New Zealand. With Pakistan’s pace department coming under criticism, Rauf’s return will no doubt bolster the Men in Green’s chances.

There are concerns in the New Zealand camp about the fitness of batter Rachin Ravindra who had suffered a face injury while fielding against Pakistan in the 1st ODI of the Tri-series. Since that injury, Rachin hasn’t been spotted in the Kiwi kit with New Zealand winning the series without him. Little is know about his status before the Champions Trophy opening match but New Zealand will hope that the talented batter recovers in time.

Title: WPL: Clinical Mumbai Indians trounce Gujarat Giants by five wickets
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-clinical-mi-trounce-gg-by-five-wickets-9843427/
Content:
All-rounder Nat Sciver-Brunt starred in both departments as Mumbai Indians produced a clinical performance to return to winning ways with a five-wicket victory over a self-destructive Gujarat Giants in their Women’s Premier League (WPL) match here on Tuesday.
Sciver-Brunt smashed a 39-ball 57, her second consecutive half-century, after taking two wickets for 26, as MI first bowled out GG for a modest 120 and then chased down the target, scoring 122 for 5 with 3.5 overs to spare.
Invited to bat, Gujarat paid the price for their over-aggression, with MI’s bowlers, led by off-spinner Hayley Matthews, delivering a tight performance. Shabnim Ismail (1/17), Amelia Kerr (2/22), and Amanjot Kaur (1/17) also played key roles in restricting Gujarat’s batting.
In response, Sciver-Brunt dazzled with a flurry of boundaries, playing cut, pull, sweep, and scoop shots with ease. She hit 11 fours during her innings and was dismissed in the 16th over with just seven runs required to win.
Chasing 121, MI lost Matthews (17), Yastika Bhatia (8) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (4) early as MI slipped to 55-3 in the 8th over.
However, Sciver-Brunt continued to dominate, bringing up her fifty with a four off Ashleigh Gardner in the 14th over. Amelia Kerr (19) also contributed with a six and a four before being dismissed by Gautam.
Earlier, Gujarat’s batting imploded as they tried to muscle the ball rather than build partnerships.
Only two batters in the top six reached double digits, with Harleen Deol top-scoring with a 31-ball 32. Kashvee Gautam (20) and Tanuja Kanwar (13) also got starts but failed to capitalize.
Gujarat were in early trouble, crashing to 16 for 3 in the 4th over, with Beth Mooney (1), Laura Wolvaardt (4), and Dayalan Hemalatha (9) back in the pavilion. Hemalatha has been in poor form for some time.
Gujarat’s in-form skipper, Ashleigh Gardner (10), tried to inject some momentum, pulling Sciver-Brunt for a six, but was dismissed on the very next delivery. Deandra Dottin went for a slog and was stumped by Yastika Bhatia off Kerr, leaving Gujarat at 43 for 5 in 8.2 overs.
Deol and Gautam added 24 runs off 19 balls, with the latter hitting a big six off Ismail. However, Matthews induced a faint edge to dismiss Gautam.

Deol hit two boundaries off Kerr in the 13th over but was dismissed by Amanjot Kaur in the 17th over.
Sayali Satghare (13) hit a couple of boundaries late in the innings to offer some respectability to the total.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Md Azharuddeen prolongs Gujarat’s agony with a leisurely 149* as Kerala aim for 500
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-semifinal-md-azharuddeen-149-kerala-vs-gujarat-9843253/
Content:
Even as the hapless Gujarat fielders dished out colourful conversations to try and break Kerala’s resolve during another day of marathon batting, the two most happening addas of the day took place inside the restaurant hall of the Narendra Modi Stadium post-play in the evening.
Kerala coach Amay Khurasiya enquired about the formulating powdery patch outside the left-hander’s off-stump at one end with his trusted spin lieutenant Aditya Sarwate who had helped centurion Mohammed Azharuddeen to see off the day as Kerala added 212 runs to their overnight score with negligible shift in scoring intent. The idea of ‘time and turn’ dominated the discussion as Kerala extended the slow-cooking process to 177 overs, entering stumps at 418 for seven.
The coach’s words to Sarwate revolved around the shaky patch, which would in due course, become vital to Kerala’s bowling plans led by the left-armer and off-spinner Jalaj Saxena against a Gujarat line-up crammed by four southpaws in the top order.
While Khurasiya and Sarwate exchanged plans in one corner, Kerala skipper Sachin Baby approached the Kathi roll counter with a clever question wrapped up deftly in his pocket. After setting up the innings with his overnight 69 in 193 balls, Baby only lasted two deliveries in the morning before poking hard at Arzan Nagwaswalla’s late away-shaping delivery to first-slip. Baby surely had to have another moment to cap off a long day and ensure everything was under control.
Catching up with Gujarat spinner Siddharth Desai who ran another pale day on the field, Baby quizzed the 24-year-old on his thoughts on the pitch. “What is the behaviour of the wicket like? Wasn’t it turning at all?” questioned Baby. “It’s a slow turner,” came the response from Gujarat’s highest wicket-taker, eyes firmly on the paneer rolls and not the seasoned Kerala pro.
Azharuddeen would not quite agree with Desai after he remained the least effective spinner on the pitch — Gujarat captain Chintan Gaja only summoned him five minutes before lunch on Tuesday. With Desai’s backup left-armer Vishal Jayswal extracting sharp turn and lift from odd balls in the evening, Kerala’s tempestuous wicket-keeper said that “every run tomorrow is going to tire their minds and body.”
Carrying on from his overnight start alongside Baby, Azharuddeen (149 not out) dictated the mind games on the pitch, even conquering his own aggressive impulses while at it.
“There are times when the hand naturally goes for a swing but the coach’s sound instructions have held it all back. Playing to his advice and guidance is all that I have been trying to do here and throughout the season that has helped this time on the whole,” said Azhar after breaking a duck of seven years since his first Ranji Trophy century to etch another in a pivotal semifinal setting.
The lull in between saw him out of the red-ball side for two years post Covid-19. Poor outings in the season-opening white-ball tournaments meant the management’s patience ran out before the Ranji campaigns then, he candidly admitted.
A natural top-order bat, Azharuddeen’s slide to a No. 6 keeper-bat role this year has shot up his red-ball fortunes. Sharing the space behind Fortress Baby with his old-time buddy Salman Nizar (52), the pair have set up another lower-order bastion that is defining Kerala’s unique Ranji campaign. Even as Nagwaswalla and the Gujarat dugout roared in delight after snapping Baby second ball, the pressure was adroitly quelled by the North Kerala bonhomie that lasted 368 deliveries for 149 runs.
Gaja’s men trimmed from roars to hoots and chirps through the afternoon as the sixth-wicket pair ransacked 87 runs in the first session before slowing down to 60 in the next two hours, hoarding 30 more overs.
“There was a lot of colourful sledging going on. The time to react to all that is long gone. I only find them all to be so hilarious these days. But there is a special feeling and fun you get seeing the frustration of the opposition when they go wicketless for so long,” the 30-year-old Azharuddeen reflects with a chuckle.
Seizing the opportunity of a dropped catch at first slip and Gujarat’s sloppy lapses in missing out on two lbw counts without opting for the DRS, Azharuddeen maintained the metronomic rhythm of his longest First-Class innings with a sturdy defence and an uncluttered mind. Unlike his famous Hyderabadi namesake’s leg-side dexterity, “Azhar Jr.” maintained a regular love for the off-side, carving the extra cover to point region with supple front and back-footed drives.
Azharuddeen credits the much “involved” Khurasiya’s timely interventions behind Kerala’s cohesive defence. “He sends in inputs through notes at the right time from the dugout on the field where he remains throughout the day,” says Azhar, stressing that the frequent “paper-written notes leave longer images and impressions” in the mind.

With the pitch beginning to offer continual turn, Azharuddeen said the attritional targets to burn out more overs will continue with him and Sarwate poised to return on day three. “The target was to exhaust as many overs as possible and not bat quickly to get to 400 or something in a five-day game. Getting to 500 is the plan and that will begin to play a lot on their mind and body. We have far more experienced spinners in Jalaj and Sarwate to handle the job from there,” he said with apt clarity.
Brief Scores: Kerala 418 for seven in 177 overs (Md Azharuddeen 149 batting, Sachin Baby 69, Arzan Nagwaswalla 3-64) vs Gujarat

Title: Ranji Trophy: Spinner Parth Rekhade wrecks Mumbai who go from 113/2 to 113/5 in one lethal 41st over
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-parth-rekhade-mumbai-vidarbha-semifinal-9843188/
Content:
IT seemed like everything was going as per the plan for Mumbai. The defending champions had managed to restrict Vidarbha for 383 runs on the second day of the Ranji Trophy semi-finals, after the home side had resumed on 308 for 5. They were cruising slowly towards the total at Nagpur despite opener Ayush Mhatre getting out in the fifth over. They had lost Siddhesh Lad at the stroke of tea on the team score of 85, but Mumbai never imagined when going ahead that one over would change the course of the game.
The dressing room felt the tremors in the 41st over through left-arm spinner Parth Rekhade, who was playing his second first class game for Vidarbha.
Mumbai would be left stuttering at 188/7, a whole 195 runs adrift in Nagpur.
On the score of 113/2, Ajinkya Rahane had survived a few chances off pacer Yash Thakur. He went for an expansive drive that took a thick edge but the ball passed between wicket-keeper and first slip. Few balls later he was given leg before but a television replay showed that the pacer had crossed his front-foot line.
The Mumbai captain was riding on a stroke of luck but it soon ended. Rahane went behind to defend Parth’s straight one, got his bat in but the ball tossed up and went on to hit the stumps. Suryakumar Yadav redirected one to short square leg, and one ball later went for defense, but found a thick edge which went on to hit his pads. The ball ballooned in the air towards silly point where Danish Malewar caught him on the second attempt. Shivam Dube went to defend the first ball but the next ball he too went back and found a sharp edge to see Karun Nair grabbing it in the slips.
Mumbai lost three big wickets in a span of five balls. From 113 for 2 at one stage they were 113 for 5. It was a collapse no one expected in the outing so far.
With Shams Mulani walking in, the situation wasn’t new for him. In this season, as in the past few games, Mumbai has witnessed its top batsmen marching away without much contribution. Mulani swept one to left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey for a boundary, and one ball later, the Mumbai batsman tried to defend. The ball hit his pad first, there was a loud scream from Vidarbha, but the umpire turned it down. They took help of DRS, it was a close call and the ball was hitting the pad first which resulted in Mumbai losing four wickets in a span of five runs.
After the game Parth, who bowled 16 overs with an economy of 1.0, recalled what happened in those two overs which brought them back in the game.
“They had a partnership and they were playing gritty cricket. My captain had clearly told me that I need to bowl a tight line from one end. Even when I got two wickets, I didn’t change my plan. If you see, Mumbai players are gritty and they will go for runs, so it was important to keep bowling tight,” he recalled, calling the third wicket of Dube, one of his very best.
Mumbai once again looked to their most experienced batsman, Shardul Thakur to rescue the side. He has been doing it for the past few seasons and it was evident all hopes were on him again. Mumbai’s lower order has been the most consistent with the bat this season and they have delivered when it mattered the most.
Thakur meant business and he charged Vidarbha bowlers. He hammered two back to back fours to pacers Darshan Nalkande and while he batted, the Mumbai score kept ticking. With opener Akash Anand, holding fort at the other end, Mumbai looked for another big partnership.
Vidarbha bowled short to Thakur and invited him to pull by keeping a fielder at deep square leg.
On 37 where he had managed to strike a six and four fours, Thakur went for the short ball from pacer Thakur but found a man straight in the deep, and  the plan had worked. Thakur and Anand added 60 runs for the seventh wicket. At stumps, Mumbai are trailing by 195 runs with Anand and Tanush Kotian batting on 67 and 5 respectively.
Meanwhile for Parth it would certainly be a day to remember. The team dropped veteran offie Akshay Wakhare and had picked the 25-year-old left-arm spinner Parth. He had moved to Services in 2022 as he had got a job of petty officer but a knee surgery ensured that cricket took a halt. Services don’t allow players to play for other states once they are in their service. He wanted to play for Vidarbha and later an issue in his ‘document’ resulted in him quitting his services job and trying for his state team where he has played all age group tournaments.
A mischievous boy at the age of nine, Parth’s mother, who is a teacher, had asked her husband Rajesh to enroll their son to a nearby sports camp so that he would get exhausted and sleep early. His father gave him a choice of badminton and cricket, Parth chose the 22-yards. When he claimed two Indian captains-Rahane and Surya followed by another Indian all-rounder Dube, it would certainly have pleased him. However, with three days left in the game, Vidarbha and Parth know the game is not over yet.

Brief Scores: Vidarbha 383 off 107.5 overs (Danish Malewar 79, Yash Rathod 54, Shivam Dube 5-49) lead Mumbai 188/7 off 59 overs (Akash Anand 67*, Shardul Thakur 37, Parth Rekhade 3-16) by 195 runs

Title: Ranji Trophy: How unlikely Shivam Dube instigated a Vidarbha collapse
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-unlikely-shivam-dube-vidarbha-5-wickets-9843172/
Content:
Two weeks after England captain Jos Buttler criticised India’s decision to substitute the concussed Shivam Dube with outright quick Harshit Rana during a T20 game, Dube proved his bowling chops with a five-wicket haul against Vidarbha in the Ranji Trophy semifinal in Nagpur. His 5 for 49 on the track which didn’t offer much assistance to seamers bowlers, helped Mumbai restrict Vidarbha’s first innings tally to 383, even though Mumbai squandered the advantage with a shoddy batting performance.
“Either Shivam Dube has put on about 25mph with the ball or Harshit has really improved his batting.It is not a like-for-like replacement,” Buttler would say. Here he didn’t crank up the pace or bend the ball around the corners. But he probed tight lines and length to prise out his third five-wicket haul in this format.
He felt he bowled a few yards quicker than he normally does. “I have noticed that earlier in red-ball games I used to bowl in the mid-120s but in this game, many of my balls have crossed the 130 kph mark. I was working on pace and I always had the skill to pick wickets with the red-ball, now the additional pace has helped even more,” he said.  I was working on my pace. I worked quite hard on my run-up and fitness,” he said.
“Even I wasn’t sure whether it has helped me in gaining speed but it was nice to see it having translated on the speed gun. It’s really difficult but I have been working hard on it,” he added.
Out of three wickets he got in the space of 17 balls on Tuesday—on Monday, he had ejected Parth Rekhade and Karun Nair—two came off bouncer to tail-enders. With the pitch not offering much, he said he resorted to frequent use of bouncers to distract batsmen. “I had a brief chat with Morne Morkel during the England (limited overs) series, he also suggested a couple of things and I practised on them,” he explained.
His five-for will light up the eyes of national selectors in eternal search for a seam-bowling all-rounder. Nitish Kumar Reddy has sprung up, but before the England tour, they would like to create depth, in case of late injuries. Dube admitted that “it’s always been a dream to play Test cricket,” but insisted that he is not thinking too far ahead.
With the Test dream stirring him, Dube has worked extensively on his fitness and run up. He shrugged off white-ball labelling. “I don’t think anything about it. It’s not about being a white-ball specialist. People speak depending on the format you do well in. If they check my domestic performances, they will realise that I am not a white-ball specialist but a proper all-rounder who can play in all formats,” he points out.

A sparsely used bowler even in domestic red-ball circuit, he has impressive  numbers for a part-timer though. In 38 innings with the ball, he has plucked 58 wickets at an average of 22.42. However, injuries halted his natural development. But when not restricted by injuries, he says he wants to chip in with the overs.  “Definitely I have been used (mainly) as a batting allrounder but I have been thinking about utilising my bowling abilities more whenever given a chance. That’s why I have been working hard and getting the results now. I am happy with the reward in this game,” he said.

Title: 12,000 police officers and 9 charter flights: Here’s how Pakistan is preparing for ICC Champions Trophy 2025
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-preparation-for-champions-trophy-police-charter-planes-9843002/
Content:
Pakistan is ready to host an international cricket tournament after a gap of 29 years and the hosts are making sure that there are no stones unturned in making the event a successful one.
The last major ICC tournament to be hosted by Pakistan was the 1996 Cricket World Cup with Sri Lanka and India as co-hosts. After that, the terrorist attack on the visiting Sri Lankan team in 2009 deprived the nation of opportunities to host international matches as overseas teams were reluctant to come.
Along with the hosts, India, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, New Zealand and South Africa will participate in the event and all the matches will be played in Pakistan barring the India matches which will be played in Dubai.
Here is how the country is preparing for the events:
The country has organized comprehensive security team for the tournament and Punjab Police will take care of the security in Lahore and Rawalpindi. As reported by Pakistani news outlet Geo TV, over 12,000 officers and personnel will be deployed to ensure the security during the matches.
Three matches will be played in Lahore on February 22, 26, and March 5 while three matches will be organised in Rawalpindi on February 24, 25 and 27.
A total of 18 senior officers, 54 DSPs, 135 inspectors, and 1,200 upper subordinates will be on duty, while 10,556 constables and over 200 female police officers will also be assigned security and checking duties.
The tournament will kick off on February 19 (Wednesday) with the opening match in Karachi between Pakistan and New Zealand, which will be played after a small ceremony at the National Bank Cricket Stadium.
Apart from the security measures, Pakistan’s national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has announced special charter flights for the fans.
There will be nine special charter flights that will be operated between Karachi, Islamabad, and Lahore during the event for the smooth transportation of both fans and teams. PIA will be also showcase the culture of Pakistan during these flights.

While there were questions about the readiness of Pakistan for the event, the country looks set to welcome the return of major ICC tournament.

Title: World record: USA beat Oman to defend lowest ever ODI total
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/world-record-usa-beat-oman-to-defend-lowest-ever-odi-total-9843090/
Content:
The United States of America on Tuesday successfully defended the lowest-ever total of 122 in a non-curtailed ODI match to beat Oman by 57 runs in a their Cricket World Cup League 2 match here.
It is the lowest successfully defended totals in men’s ODIs and excluding matches with a revised target or reduced overs.
In conditions heavily favouring spin, it was the metronomic work of Nosthush Kenjige that led the American charge, with the left-arm spinner claiming 5/11 from 7.3 overs to sink the hosts for just 65.
Milind Kumar’s off-spin (2/17) claimed the key wicket of Oman captain Jatinder Singh (7) and the men from the Sultanate showed little resolve in their chase.
Harmeet Singh (1/25) and Yasir Mohammed’s 2/10 complimented Kenjige, who wrapped up proceedings by trapping No 11 Siddharth Bukkapatnam (0).
The score of 65 all-out is also Oman’s lowest in the men’s international format.
While the surface at the Oman Cricket Academy has shown more zip in previous years, most notably at the 2021 edition of the T20 World Cup, the recent ODI tri-series which forms part of Cricket World Cup 2027 qualification has seen conditions suit slower bowlers.
Not a single over of pace was bowled in the match, with Oman’s five-pronged spin attack matched by USA’s Milind Kumar, Harmeet Singh, Yasir Mohammad and Kenjige.
Electing to bowl in the hope of emulating their spin success against Namibia two days prior, the hosts stifled Monank Patel’s side, with the skipper (0) being one of the five batters to fall inside the first 13 overs.
Aaron Jones (16) and Sanjay Krishnamurthi (16) fought in spite of the elements, though it was Milind (47*) on a solo mission, hitting six boundaries to move the score past three figures.

The Americans lasted just 35.3 overs with Shakeel Ahmad’s 3/20, the best for the Omanis, though the effort would be usurped by their opposition’s spin quartet.

Title: Shardul Thakur signs with Essex, set to make debut in English county cricket
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shardul-thakur-signs-with-essex-debut-county-cricket-9843004/
Content:
India’s Shardul Thakur is set to make his debut in English county cricket with the allrounder scheduled to play 7 matches for Essex in Division One from the beginning of the 2025 season. Thakur has impressed with his batting as well as his bowling in the ongoing Ranji Trophy season, scoring 51 and 119 for his second First-Class century last month against Jammu and Kashmir and a 84-run innings against Meghalaya.
The 33-year-old, who has played 47 ODIs, 11 Tests and 25 T20Is for India, also recently took a hat-trick in the match against Meghalaya.
“I am feeling excited to join Essex this summer. Personally it brings new challenges and opportunities to showcase my talent and skills. County cricket is something I always wanted to experience and I am glad that I’ll be representing the Eagles,” Thakur was quoted as saying by Essex on their website.
✍️ Welcome to Essex, Shardul Thakur!
🦅 #FlyLikeAnEagle pic.twitter.com/mUGQCCBJIC
— Essex Cricket (@EssexCricket) February 18, 2025
Essex’s director of cricket and former England and Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said, “We were very clear amongst ourselves that a high quality quick bowler, with lower-order batting ability, was a key target for the Club this winter.
“In Shardul, we have signed just that, and we can’t wait to welcome him to Essex and see how he gets on
in the County Championship,” he added.

Thakur, who was not picked by any of the Indian Premier League teams in the mega auction ahead of the 2025 season, would thus get ample game-time and exposure to conditions in England to prove his form and fitness ahead of India’s tour of England in June for five Tests.

Title: Champions Trophy preview: Pace-heavy Pakistan take on subcontinental New Zealand
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-preview-pace-heavy-pakistan-vs-new-zealand-9843020/
Content:
All On the Line, screams the giant billboards of Champions Trophy in all the host cities, from Dubai to Lahore cutting across Karachi and Rawalpindi. There is nothing extraordinarily imaginative or attention-grabbing about the caption. But it captures everything the tournament means to the country as well as its cricket. The global gaze would be on Pakistan’s competence to pull off a multinational tournament, bereft of distressing incidents, when the locals as well as the foreigners could watch the game without fear of their lives.
But irresistible is the narrative arc whether Pakistan, liberated after remapping itself on the cricket map, could rediscover the old glory on the field. At the peak of 50-over mania, Pakistan was the cult team. The team of exotic and dark arts, reverse swing and toe-crushers, of roguish volatility and irascible brilliance, of alley-cats and superstars, a theatre and law unto themselves. If you didn’t blatantly love them, you clandestinely envied them. The slow fading of ODI’s charms ran parallel, and was entwined, perhaps, with Pakistan’s drift to mediocrity in this format. Perhaps, for ODIs to resurrect, it needs Pakistan cricket to revive too.
The batch of 2025 doesn’t exude the marvel or mystique of the 80s, 90s, 2000s or even the 2017 squadron of Sarfraz that pulled off a heist in tune with the country’s fetish for chaotic thrills and quirk to tear all pre-tournament calculations to bits of paper. But they are riding a wave of resurgence, losing only three of their last eleven games. Since the catastrophic World Cup in India, they have beaten Australia, South Africa and Zimbabwe away. The defeats to New Zealand, who they countenance in the tournament opener, in the triangular series partially dishevelled the momentum they had gathered in this span. But there are vital signs of the Mohammed Rizwan-led group mounting a stiff title (defence) challenge.
🎥 ICYMI: Highlights of a star-studded ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Curtain Raiser in Lahore ✨

— Pakistan Cricket (@TheRealPCB) February 17, 2025
At the soul of their revitalised spirit is the oldest strength of theirs. Pure, raw fast bowling. In Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and Muhammad Hasnain, they have a fearsome quartet, a fusion of high pace and intelligence, capable of producing magic and madness, efficiency and intensity, even if Hasnain and Rauf are notoriously erratic.
In the absence of high-class spinners—Khushdil Shah, Salman Agha and Kamran Ghulam don’t evoke the dread of Saqlain Mushtaq or Saeed Ajmal, or even Imad Wasim—the pacers would heavy-lift the bowling duties. Pakistan, wisely, didn’t squeeze in spinners for the sake of it. They will hope the surfaces would be tailored to conceal this uncharacteristic shortage of spinners, now a misplaced heritage for the land that raised Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed, rather than ally with the opponent’s strengths.
Paradoxically, New Zealand look the more subcontinental side. The Black Caps have a retinue of spinners, specialists and part-timers who could revel on turning tracks. None of them are magical but men cannily fulfilling their duties. Captain Mitchell Santner exemplifies their clinical prowess–since the start of last year, he has leaked just 4.23 runs an over.
The triseries triumph attested to the faculties that make them one of the favourites to end the Pakistan trip in glory—resourceful spin stock, relentless seamers, robust batting core and an experienced nucleus inspiring. Had not injuries stalled quicks Lockie Ferguson and Ben Sears, they would have been an all the more intimidating proposition.
Heartening has been the return of Kane Williamson, whose 133 not out against South Africa, conveyed his cracking form. Daryl Mitchell, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips and Devon Conway comprise a tip-top batting phalanx that could kill an opponent through more ways than one. The batting depth is so enviable that Santner, an all-rounder of redoubtable calibre, is pinned down at No 8.
Contrastingly, the injury to Saim Ayub, the left-handed opener behind Pakistan’s revival after the World Cup slump, has been a rude jolt. The fretting over his replacement resulted in the extreme measure of pushing Babar Azam up the order. Babar would again be the leading light, now that he has been unburdened of captaincy chores. Like the game in the country, Pakistan would pray for his revival too. Though topping the batting charts, according to the ICC, he is without a hundred for the last two years, the drought stretching 21 innings. If not, the responsibilities on the ageing shoulders of ex-seabird Fakhar Zaman, the chief engineer of the 2017 victory, would swell. Captain Mohammed Rizwan’s rich vein of runs inspires hope. But Pakistan would need contributions from down the order—from the likes of Khushdil Shah and Faheem Ashraf—to make the long-awaited tournament at home memorable.

Weighing in the balance, form and composition of both sides, an argument that New Zealand begin as favourites over the host nation doesn’t sound hyperbolic. But no team parodies the odds or performs the unexpected as expectedly or gloriously as Pakistan does. The 2017 triumph was a prime example, when they entered the tournament as the eighth ranked team and toppled the overwhelming favourites that were Virat Kohli’s India. There is more riding on the tournament this time—capacity to host a multinational tournament event-free, a shot at rediscovering their mystique and a title defence—that the routine caption aptly captures what it means for the country and the sport it feverishly watches. It’s all on the line for Pakistan.

Title: Important for us to play to our optimum level: PAK captain Mohammad Rizwan before opening match vs NZ in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammad-rizwan-optimum-level-champions-trophy-pak-vs-nz-9842764/
Content:
Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan said that the side needed to be on top of their game if they want to do well in the Champions Trophy, starting on Wednesday. He also said that they need to rectify the side’s tendency to collapse under pressure.
“It is hard to say how we will perform on a particular day because it is important for us to play to our optimum level to win matches,” Rizwan said a day before Pakistan take on New Zealand in the tournament opener.
“I think we lack that one or two per cent needed to win matches under pressure because unfortunately, we tend to crack under pressure and lose close matches as we have seen in recent games,” he added..
The Pakistan captain also urged his side to show the same resilience in the Champions Trophy which they had shown during the 10-year period when no international side toured the country.
“I think, most importantly, we should all enjoy the Champions Trophy as it is after a long time (that) we are having such a big event in Pakistan, after 10 years (that) we spent playing our home matches elsewhere,” Rizwan said.
“If you see, even in those 10 years (that) we suffered, Pakistan cricket did well and won big matches including being the Test No 1team and (winning the) Champions Trophy. I hope we can repeat that same thing in this tournament,” he added.
No top team in international cricket had toured Pakistan following the terrorist attacks on the Sri Lankan team in March 2009 until the start of this decade when top teams such as Australia, England and New Zealand resumed visiting their Asian opponent.

In between, Pakistan hosted Zimbabwe in 2015 and a World XI side under Faf du Plessis had toured for a three-match T20I series to quell concerns regarding security.

Content:
Defending champions and hosts Pakistan take on New Zealand in the first game of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.
Just before the start of the match, New Zealand were handed the bad news that Lockie Ferguson would miss the whole tournament due to an injury he picked up in the warm-up match against Afghanistan on Sunday. He will return home immediately and his place in the New Zealand squad will be taken by Kyle Jamieson, who played his most-recent one-day international in September 2023.
Pakistan, on the other hand, will be buoyed by the news that pacer Haris Rauf is fighting fit after he missed most of the tri-series at home against New Zealand and South Africa due to an injury.
Here’s a look at all the details for the PAK vs NZ clash:
The PAK vs NZ match will happen on Wednesday at 2.30 with the toss at 2 pm (IST). The match will be played at Karachi’s National Stadium. The match will be broadcast on TV on Star Sports and Network 18 channels. You can also livestream the PAK vs NZ match on JioHotstar.
Pakistan: Mohammad Rizwan (c & wk), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Salman Ali Agha, Usman Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi.
New Zealand: Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham (wk), Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young, Jacob Duffy.
Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan (c&wk), Salman Ali Agha, Tayyab Tahir, Khushdil Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf.
Will Young, Devon Conway, Kane Williamson, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (wk), Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Nathan Smith, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson.
The pitch at Karachi’s National Stadium is expected to aid a high-scoring contest. IF the past is any indication, pacers might receive some early assistance. But as the game progresses, the surface is likely to favour batters. Spinners could find some grip on the surface when it starts deteriorating.
The weather forecast for Karachi for Wednesday predicts a bright and sunny day. Temperatures are likely to hover in the 20s, which will be ideal playing conditions for both teams.

Other key dates
The event kicks off at the National Stadium in Karachi on February 19, with Pakistan taking on New Zealand. India, who are the runners-up from 2017 and two-time winners, play their first game on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai. The India vs Pakistan game happens on Sunday, February 23. Reigning Cricket World Cup winners Australia face England in their opening fixture on Saturday, February 22.
The two semi-finals will be played on March 4 and March 5 in Dubai and Lahore respectively. The final is scheduled for March 9.
Previously the top-eight ranked ODI sides would feature in the Champions Trophy. But for the 2025 edition, the qualification used the results of the 2023 edition of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup. The teams that occupied the top-eight spots in the 10-team points table, including the hosts Pakistan, sealed their place for the Champions Trophy.
The format of the competition has endured since 2006. The eight teams are divided into two groups of four teams each. Each team plays once against every other team in the group. And then, the top-two teams from each group advance to the semi-finals, determining the two that will feature in the summit clash.
The uncertainty about the venue of the Champions Trophy final exists because of Team India. The Indians have refused to travel to Pakistan for any cricket matches. So if they make it to the final, the game will be played in Dubai, where India are playing all their Group A games including the one against Pakistan. If India do not make it to the final, the game will be played in Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Pakistan was supposed to be the solo host country until India’s refusal to play in Pakistan forced the ICC to propose a hybrid model.
The eight teams at this year’s Champions Trophy are competing for $2.24 million. The runners-up will receive $1.12 million, while each losing semi-finalist will take home $560,000. The total prize pool has increased by 53 percent from the 2017 edition, reaching $6.9 million.

Title: Inzamam Ul Haq on terror attack on Sri Lanka in 2009: ‘We were punished for 10 years… Our cricket went backwards’

The ICC Champions Trophy will mark the return of big-ticket cricket to Pakistan after nearly three decades. The last mega, multi-team event hosted by Pakistan was the 1996 World Cup, which Pakistan co-hosted with Sri Lanka and India.
Many cricketing nations avoided touring Pakistan after the 2009 terror attack where the Sri Lankan cricket team had come under attack from terrorists.
“The events of 2009 feel like a bad dream,” former Pakistan captain Inzamam Ul Haq said recently while talking about the terror attack on Sri Lanka. “We were punished for 10 years. Our cricket went backwards.”
The Pakistan national team hosted its ‘home’ games in the United Arab Emirates before teams started to reluctantly travel to Pakistan from 2018.
The attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team happened on March 3, 2009 while the team was playing a Test match in Lahore. The incident happened while the Sri Lankan team bus was making its way to the venue for the third day of the Test. The team bus was ambushed around 9am (local time) just outside the Gaddafi Stadium by 12 gunmen. The terrorists were heavily armed, wielding assault rifles, grenades and rocket launchers.
The terror attack had caused the deaths of six policemen and a driver escorting match officials. Several others were injured, including seven Sri Lanka players and coaching staff members of the team.
The tool could have been much higher. A rocket fired at the team bus skimmed over the roof of the vehicle while a grenade that was rolled under the bus did not detonate. Kumar Sangakkara, in his Spirit of Cricket address, spoke of a bullet hitting the seat where his head had been a second earlier.
In fact, Sri Lanka had replaced India for the tour after the Indians had pulled out after the Mumbai attacks in November 2008.

Content:
A video has surfaced on social media that allegedly shows the Indian Tricolour missing from the roof of the National Stadium in Karachi while flags of all other nations that will participate in the ICC Champions Trophy are present.
The clip caused some anger on social media. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly explained why the Indian flag was not seen at the National Stadium in Karachi ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. “The ICC has advised that only four flags will be hoisted on Champions Trophy 2025 match days – ICC (Event Authority), PCB (Event Host) and the two sides competing on that day. Simple,” an unnamed PCB spokesperson told multiple Indian media organisations which did not name the person.
No Indian flag in Karachi: As only the Indian team faced security issues in Pakistan and refused to play Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan, the PCB removed the Indian flag from the Karachi stadium while keeping the flags of the other guest playing nations.

News agency IANS meanwhile quoted a PCB source as saying: “As you know, India is not coming to Pakistan to play its matches during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025; the National Stadium in Karachi, Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and the Gaddafi Stadium Lahore have hoisted flags of countries that are going to play at the said venues.”
The Men in Blue will not be travelling to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy and will play all its matches in UAE. India will take on Bangladesh in the first game of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy and will play Pakistan on Sunday.
India and Pakistan are joined in Group A by New Zealand and Bangladesh for the Champions Trophy. The tournament starts on February 19 with the opening match between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand.

Title: WPL 2025: Smriti Mandhana leads from the front as RCB thrash Delhi Capitals
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-2025-smriti-mandhana-leads-from-the-front-as-rcb-thrash-delhi-capitals-9841444/
Content:
Royal Challengers Bengaluru skipper Smriti Mandhana was at her free-flowing best as she decimated the Delhi Capitals bowling line-up to set up an eight-wicket win in Vadodara on Monday, her team’s second successive triumph in the Women’s Premier League.
RCB chased down the target of 142 in 16.2 overs courtesy of a 107-run partnership between Mandhana (81 off 47 balls) and her opening partner Danielle Wyatt-Hodge (42 off 33).
On a night dominated by RCB, Mandhana pulled, swept, and came down the track to counter any kind of threat from the DC bowlers and killed off the chase, reaching her fifty in just 27 balls. Her innings was laced with 10 fours and three sixes before getting out with her team needing just 11 runs.
Mandhana was well supported by Wyatt-Hodge, who played second fiddle and admitted after the match that she had the best seat in the house to witness her opening partner’s belligerence.
Both openers made their intentions clear from the word go. Mandhana hit two fours off Marizanne Kapp in the first over to set the tone of the chase.
Shikha Pandey bowled a tight over, conceding just two runs. DC captain Meg Lanning then turned to Minnu Manni, knowing Mandhana often struggles against off-spinners. But the opening batter brought out the sweep to take on the offie and hit two fours in the over, keeping the scoring rate high.
The assault continued from the other side as Wyatt-Hodge scored two fours of Shikha in the next over. Mandhana then took on Arundhati Reddy, hitting the first six of the innings. Meanwhile, Wyatt-Hodge hit two more fours against Shikha in the next over.
RCB posted 66 runs in the Powerplay without any casualties, and both batters were in no mood to take their feet off the pedal. Mandhana reached her half-century in the ninth over with a single. Kapp returned in the next over but was taken to the cleaners by both batters. RCB stood at 102/0 after 10 overs.
Wyatt-Hodge and Mandhana got out trying to further accelerate the scoring rate, but Ellyse Perry and Richa Ghosh, instrumental in RCB’s win in the tournament’s opening game, took their team home, with Ghosh finishing the game off with a six.
Earlier, Renuka Singh Thakur and Georgia Wareham combined to share six wickets as RCB bowled out DC for a mere 141.
Renuka returned figures of 3/23, while Wareham bagged 3/25 as RCB fought back impressively after Delhi had reached a comfortable 55/1 after the Powerplay.
Shafali Verma, as she often does, wanted to go hard from the first ball but only managed to hole out to Mandhana off the bowling of Renuka Singh Thakur on the very first delivery she faced.
Skipper Lanning and Jemimah Rodrigues did well to steady the ship and stitch a 59-run partnership for the second wicket. However, Jemimah (34) was stumped in the seventh over, which was followed by a steady fall of wickets.
After Jemimah’s dismissal, Lanning (17) miscued a short ball and was caught by Perry at square leg. Renuka then struck again in the 11th over, dismissing Annabel Sutherland (19) just as she was starting to find form, hitting Bisht for a six.
Kapp (12), Sarah Bryce (23) and Shikha (14) tried to build partnerships, but Ekta Bisht and Wareham made sure that Delhi’s batting folded in 19.3 overs.
Brief scores: Delhi Capitals 141 all out in 19.3 overs (Jemimah 34; Renuka 3/23, Wareham 3/25) lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru 146/2 in 16.2 overs (Mandhana 81, Wyatt-Hodge 42) by 8 wkts

Title: The Afghan campaign: Spinners will sparkle but can the batsmen shine?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/the-afghan-campaign-spinners-will-sparkle-but-can-the-batsmen-shine-9841367/
Content:
On a Pakistan’s talk show Hasna Mana Hai, former captain Rashid Latif created a stir on Sunday night by saying the talismanic Rashid Khan was more influential for Afghanistan than Wasim Akram for Pakistan. “Rashid [Khan] has truly put Afghanistan on the map and played a key role in earning them recognition. He is a more prominent figure than Wasim Akram. With all due respect, Rashid’s impact in cricket surpasses that of Akram,” Latif, a former Afghanistan coach, stated.
At the Champions Trophy, Rashid Khan will yet again lead a formidable spin attack that has been instrumental for Afghanistan’s international success. The breakout team of the last two ICC World Cups – both ODI in 2023 and T20 in 2024 – faces a potential speed bump, though. Like the colourful ‘jingle trucks’ and ornately painted inter-city buses, batsmen are expected to strut their stuff on the belter pitches Pakistan rolls out for this 50-over tournament. Given how brittle their own batting is against spinners, all indications are that these tracks will actually resemble Pakistan highways.
This immediately jogs the cursor away from Afghanistan’s renowned spin bowlers – who won’t shy away from the fight – but puts to test their batting order, not exactly as glamorous or feted as their tweakers. There is Rashid, the 40-year-old Mohammad Nabi in possibly his last ODI series, and the two left-armers, relatively known Noor Ahmad and the mostly unknown, 20-year-old slow left-arm Nangyal Kharoti. Mystery-spinner Ghazanfar missed out due to a late injury, but Kharoti has the potential to send their first opponents into a nightmare whirl.
Dumping out Pakistan and England in the 50-over World Cup was swell. Reaching the T20 World semifinals in the Caribbean after beating New Zealand and Australia was ‘sweet-as’ like the Aussies would say. But for the newbies, getting out of the group at CT 2025 playing on batting beauties in Lahore and Karachi, lumped in with Australia, South Africa and England, could be a potential reality check or sternest test of their batting cred, at any rate.
Days of romanticising their refreshing emergence and the charming novelty as ‘Graveyard of cricket empires’ are slightly wearing off. Shapoor Zadran retiring earlier this month revived flashback moments of their first-ever World Cup win against Scotland in 2015 – when his flowing mane became the iconic image of the birth of a new cricketing contender. But ten years on, it is the spine of their batting that will be gleaned for if it can crank up the big scores, pace the 50 over acceleration and consistently contend for the 300+ endgames that will play out over the next few days.
As such, Afghanistan’s mainstreaming (them being regular features) was most evident, right after they lost their first warm-up game to Pakistan by a good 150 runs. Like every argumentative cricket country, their fans began muttering over whether Hashmatullah Shahidi, a trifle out of form, ought to be replaced by Sediqullah Atal, the reserve opener. When Hashmat focusing on ‘fashion and hairstyle’ was raked up unnecessarily and their batsmen got roundly scolded on Instagram comments for going down to ‘Pakistan Z team’ (an exaggeration), you knew AfghanAtalanoo (Team Afg) has well and truly joined the cricket-verse with its constantly truculent fan base. They are properly and sufficiently cantankerous about cricket.
It was the delightful exasperation of their own fans with Pashto baritoned verdicts like ‘bekra performance’ (terrible), ‘Pa sharmono washarmawaly lanat pa taso sha’ (have some shame), tawkali player (sputtering), for the aggregate batsmanship of Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Shahidi, Ibrahim Zadran and Rahmat Shah – that summed up their frustration.
“Khan baghaira Khatami da team’ (This team is finished without Rashid Khan) – however, was the supporters’ final SOS plea, and Rashid Khan’s belated entry to the Karachi hotel, having missed the first practice match, was set to serious martial percussions by a grand-entry reel that went by the title, ‘The Arrival of Greatness.’ In the stylishly shot video, the camera focussed on his branded travel sneakers, his strolley, the wristwatch band in camouflage print, and a final face-reveal in the end, while Babar Azam, etc played bit-parts leading to a crescendo.
Khan will need help, though, and it can well come from the unknown left-arm spinner. Kharoti debuted against Ireland, and left a fair few batsmen pinned to the crease one moment and the next, reluctantly trudging back quite boggled by his quicker ball that skids on, goes straight and tipples the stumps. At Sharjah, last September, he picked 4/26 to help them drub mighty South Africa by 177 runs. He also has a wicket celebration where he jumps in a 180 turn, like a disco dancer and finishes with a He Man sky fist pump. It’d all sound very cartoonish, if you didn’t know just how much Saffers tend to stew in these repetitive demon-reels that their minds nurse. They open against Afghanistan at the CT, and could help entrench the fear of the Afghan spin sorcerers for Rashid’s band of brothers barely need help from tracks.
Still, it is the Afghan batsmen who will need to put runs on the board, to allow their tweakers a chance for chokeholds. And the Afghan board cannily roped in Pakistani Younis Khan – like they did Ajay Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo earlier – to help them break down the batting approach. Younis worked with them in 2022 when he extensively scribbled with red, green and black markers on the white drawing boards, explaining partnership building, full face of the bat and using the crease. However, coach Jonathan Trott will need to do more than to get them to run ones and twos and set them 5-over batting targets for a ODI playbook, on the Pakistan pitches. 300+ scores are basic now.
So the truly breakout star of the show might well be the player Trott has long backed to pull off wonders – Azmatullah Omarzai. The all-rounder has 17 of 24 innings in the last two years where he got into double digits, and scored seven fifties and a century at an average of 95.11. He also has some mean pace when he opens the bowling.
Ricky Ponting, who stated that Glenn Maxwell singularly stopped what ought to have been an Afghan win in 2023 WC, was clear Omarzai was the key. “Afghanistan have all-round talent, and they play well in slow and spin conditions. But Azmat who was ODI player of the year, can bat in middle order and bowl upfront. So now we have a team that can do a lot of new ball damage and not be reliant on spin as before. They’ve added a lot more depth over the last few years.” The Afghans could well steer the jingle trucks and light up the highways – with or without spin.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Haris Rauf resumes bowling in nets in massive relief for Pakistan
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-haris-rauf-resumes-bowling-nets-pakistan-9841287/
Content:
Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf revealed that he is back bowling in the nets and “feeling comfortable” after his injury in the recently-concluded tri-series in Pakistan. The Pakistan speedster also said that it would be the Pakistan team management’s decision whether he would be picked for Pakistan cricket team’s opening game against New Zealand.
“I have started doing exercises a few days back and also resumed bowling since yesterday. I am feeling comfortable and my body is okay now the team management will decide about my playing in the opening match,” Haris Rauf was quoted by wire agency PTI as telling reporters at the National Stadium.
There were doubts over Haris Rauf playing for Pakistan in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and UAE after he sustained a muscular strain in his lower chest wall in the first match of the recently-concluded three-nation event involving Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa. He was then rested — but only as a precaution — by the Pakistan Cricket Board and not played throughout the tri-nation series.
“The injury is not serious and he is expected to be fully recovered for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which commences in Karachi on 19 February,” read a PCB statement who had gone ahead and called up uncapped Akif Javed as a back-up after the first game against New Zealand..
Pakistan will need Haris Rauf at his best in the Champions Trophy as he remains a potent threat with the ball with his express pace and ability to take wickets in the middle overs.
Haris has a haul of 83 wickets in 46 one-day internationals and another 110 wickets in 79 T20 internationals, having built his reputation as a specialist white ball bowler.
Haris also played down the presence of just one specialist spinner in the squad and noted that there were other spinners as well in Khushdil Shah, Salman Agha and Kamran Ghulam.
“I think we have always formed a good bowling combination with pace and spin and it will not be different in the tournament.”

Title: Ranji Trophy semifinals: Danish Malewar, Dhruv Shorey hit 70s but Mumbai fight back against Vidarbha
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-semifinals-danish-malewar-dhruv-shorey-hit-70s-but-mumbai-fight-back-against-vidarbha-9841216/
Content:
Young Vidarbha batsman Danish Malewar is in his maiden Ranji Trophy season, but has already made quite an impact. The semifinal against Mumbai is his eighth First-Class match, and he has already registered six scores of 50 or above. His 79 on Monday helped put his team in a strong position as they ended the first day on 308/5.
However, what has concerned the 21-year-old is that in only one of those knocks did he manage to reach three figures – 115 against Gujarat. On Monday in Nagpur, Malewar again crossed the half-century mark before anxiety crept into his game. The youngster knows that he gets more cautious in his approach after crossing 60 with a nagging fear that he would get out soon.
His fears came true when he took his front foot out to left-arm spinner Shams Mulani, only managing to edge the ball to Mumbai wicketkeeper Akash Anand. It was Malewar’s second successive dismissal in the 70s after making 75 in the quarterfinal against Tamil Nadu.
However, Vidarbha would be in a happy situation after a good day against the defending champions at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Jamtha. Malewar’s solid knock combined resilience and skill, and his team will now eye a substantial first-innings total. Vidarbha has arguably been the best team on show this Ranji season, and kept Mumbai’s bowlers honest throughout the day.
Malewar’s father Vishnu, a cricket fan, had decided when he got married that if he had a son, he would make him a cricketer. But being from a lower-middle-class background, Vishnu knew it would be tough.
“My father always wanted me to be a cricketer and I got into an academy when I was seven,. He faced a lot of difficulties but ensured that my cricketing needs were taken care of. There were people who used to give me bats, pads and gloves when I made runs during my junior days. Money only started coming in post my under- 19 days,” Malewar says.
Despite crossing the 300-run mark with half their wickets intact, Vidarbha will be disappointed at how none of their batsmen made a big individual score. Everyone got a start and looked good. The pitch, on a few occasions, surprised with some turn but there was nothing to trouble the hosts on the first day of the game.
There were three partnerships of 50 or more, but the 78-run fourth-wicket stand between Malewar and Karun Nair (45) was the highest of the day. The latter, in the midst of a purple patch, would rue his inability to make another big score.
Opener Dhruv Shorey was the other major scorer for Vidarbha, scoring 74 with a steady and composed approach. He laid the foundation for his team, and his ability to build partnerships was the key. Left-arm seamer Royston Dias got opener Atharv Taide when the total was 39. He looked in two minds whether to leave the ball or play it, and his indecision only resulted in the ball kissing his gloves on its way to the wicketkeeper. Vidarbha promoted Parth Rekhade, and he put on 54 with Shorey.
Shorey hit three three consecutive boundaries off pacer Mohit Awasthi. Shivam Dube, who was probably the lone Mumbai bowler getting the ball to land on the right spot, broke the stand when Suryakumar Yadav took a low catch to dismiss Rekhade (23).
This was the trend throughout the day. Whenever Vidarbha seemed to be getting on top, they would lose a wicket. Shorey was in good form and managed to find the sweet spot of his bat on a regular basis. He and Malewar managed to get 51 runs stand for the third wicket before Mulani got the opener caught at slip.
In a crucial game like the Ranji Trophy semifinal, it’s vital for at least one batsman to play a long knock. Vidarbha’s inability to do so on the first day may come back to haunt them.
Nair’s innings showcased his skill and determination, before he was dismissed by Dubey. The season he has been having, Mumbai will be happy to get him for under 50, especially as they also managed to get Malewar in the final hour of the day’s play.
At stumps, Yash Rathod and captain Akshay Wadkar were batting on 47 and 13 respectively. Mumbai will hope they can get some early breakthroughs on the second day or else they could be staring at a sizable first-innings total.
Brief scores: Vidarbha 308/5 in 88 overs (Danish Malewar 79, Dhruv Shorey 74) vs Mumbai

Title: ‘Trisha G has set a benchmark, role clarity helped India win U-19 women’s world cup’: Coach Nooshin Al Khadeer
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/nooshin-al-khadeer-interview-trisha-g-u19-womens-world-cup-9841198/
Content:
India won the Under-19 women’s world cup in Malaysia, their second consecutive title in an unbeaten campaign. The coach Nooshin Al Khadeer, who was at the helm for the last two world cups, details the lengthy preparation, and the vital juncture against England in the semi-finals and on stars like Trisha and Vaishnavi in an interview with The Indian Express. Excerpts:
What was the role of the National Cricket Academy in preparation for the world cup?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: It was a program that started off 8 months back, when the Cricket of Excellence – it was the NCA but now called the COE. The initiative was taken to have Zonal Academies, and camps there. At Balsad, Ranchi, Nagpur, and Dehradun. We then played zonal matches with five teams at Rajkot. Then 25 girls were picked for the high-performance camp at Dharamshala in July.
Then on, those players were monitored for their daily routines, practice, fitness level. Coaches were involved everyday. Then they went to their respective states. 20 girls were picked for the tri-series Challengers in October, soon after their domestic cricket. Another camp was held in mid November at the COE.  Two teams were picked for the tri-series which happened in Pune, in which we played India A, India B, and again South Africa. Only after that the Asia Cup squad was selected and then the world cup. So that was the long process.
When did the preparation start, the drills for slow-and-sticky conditions in Malaysia and target-setting you had done in the camp?
Nooshin Al Khadeer:  The camp started from April 19th itself. We had a lot of role clarity in terms of which batter is going to play where and asked to practice for over a period of time, be it batters or bowlers. In the high performance camp in July, all the 25 players knew exactly what their roles were.
The Asia Cup happening in Malaysia also helped the girls to adapt to the conditions, because we played at the same venue, where the World Cup was, so that was like a game changer. In Pune we had grey soil, when we played South Africa, and in Malaysia we had the red soil. In the World Cup, we happened to get both the soils to play on, so the players were aware of the conditions, and they adapted it quite well.
So, the state associations also gave the same roles, like what, the same batting numbers?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: Mostly. At least the players knew exactly what the roles were. Trisha opened there. Bhavika and Ishwari opened for Maharashtra, which was great, because if you are able to handle the swing of the new ball, then it’s all the more easier for you as a middle-order batter to contribute.
Against England in the semi-final, the first few overs with the ball didn’t go your way, like, and then how did you correct it at the time?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: England was unknown devils for us as they were in a different group. Semi-finals nerves, initially, we did not execute the plans. We gave them too much room. But during that strategic time, we discussed what exactly we could do, and the comeback was great then. You know, every bowler contributed.
But I would give a high rate on the mental agility of the players. You know, when a team is on 70 runs in the first 10 overs, and to pack them for 113, just giving 50 runs in the next 10 overs, where they had 8 wickets in hand – and we got 6 wickets of theirs. It just shows the kind of character these girls had. England itself in their group stages have not batted first, for us to know their batting order. They had always fielded first.
I remember when I walked into the strategic time, the only thing we discussed was, can we restrict them to 50 runs, and keep it simple bowling on the stumps, not giving them room. But, you know, it’s always tough that, you know, it’s easier said than done. Their plus point was the calmness they had on the ground. Nobody was worked up. Everybody was in a good head space. They knew that the next 10 overs is what they wanted to do, and how they could do it, because they have been going through this. Like I said, in Pune, we played on grey soil, so they exactly knew how the comebacks are done on that soil. So it has worked out for us in the team.
India did dominate all the sides through the tournament. But just ahead of the start of the tournament, which was the side you were a bit wary of?
Nooshin Al Khadeer:  No, I don’t think we ever had that kind of discussion in the dressing room. That this team is going to be tough. Or even among the staff, we never had that discussion. We were just sticking to our plans. We knew what our strengths are and how we need to get things to work on our end. We knew that we were prepared, well prepared for this tournament. And we backed our instincts.
Throughout the tournament, the lower order or even the middle order didn’t get much of the batting. The top order did most of the scoring, was there a worry?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: To just counter this question, Nikki Prasad hardly got to bat in the World Cup. That’s about a month, right? In game time. And you saw in the first game what she did for DC. She won that game for them. Okay. And that has always come because we’ve given enough practice and enough time in our preparation. The team was always there for practice. We knew that our middle order had not got enough to bat. But the same unit had gone the next day practising as if what if we were doing it.
What did you do specifically in training to replicate those match situations?
Nooshin Al Khadeer:  There was no off session because we were winning games. We always had practice.
We were lucky Malaysia had a lot of resources as net bowlers. Plus our bowling unit. There were times where the net sessions were extended to one and a half hours where the batters had enough time to bat. So that they are game ready.
You have worked with Trisha G, in 2023 and 2025. So, what change have you seen in her mindset and skills?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: I think she has developed a few shots, worked on her on-side really well. She was always known for the one who hits over covers or straight through the ground. But something to play on the on-side fearlessly. And her back foot shots she has worked on. So, her pull, her cuts have got a little better.
Her mindset was to score at a very healthy strike rate. I think Asia Cup gave her a lot of confidence when got the runs and won the Women of the Tournament. And then to get even better in the World Cup. Getting a century under your belt in a World Cup, the first one is always special. And she deserved it for the reason is that she has evolved her game as a cricketer.
Where do you see her ceiling? As of now, she doesn’t have a WPL contract. But how far do you think she can get?
Nooshin Al Khadeer:  We judge a lot on one performance. I think we should just allow the player to grow. She has set a benchmark. She has made an announcement that there is a Trisha G. And I don’t think WPLs or these bigger leagues are a reward for what she has done to get the cup for us. If it is meant, it will come her way. But I would always prefer Trisha G going out there and winning a lot of games for India. And that will give her a platform of WPL. So, an India tag is always going to allow a player in a WPL. It’s not that WPL will allow a player for India. It’s the other way around. So, soon she will find a way.
A word on Vaishnavi Sharma who picked up 17 wickets. What are her strengths with the ball?
Nooshin Al Khadeer:  The 17 wickets is a reward of her being very consistent with her line and length.  I think she was quite disciplined with her line and length. She is somebody who is very hard on herself; that even if she bowls one bad ball, she wants to come really hard on herself to do it. Quite disciplined stump-to-stump attack and the lengths were great.
You have seen WPL come through in the last few years. What is the impact of the tournament on teenagers coming through?
Nooshin Al Khadeer: It is quite impactful in the sense that you see a lot of youngsters coming in. And sharing the room with some of the legendary players of the Indian team. And obviously, the foreigners also. That one month is a great exposure to understand the routines. So, as a player, you should be aware of both the set-ups. Dealing with foreign coaches. Their mindsets. How they want to take this game forward. How they feel. You get a clear picture of two different scenarios. Which is good for players to come up with. So, it is a great exposure.

Immaculate scouting and a close-knit dressing room have been among the factors that have propelled the Mumbai Indians to five IPL trophies. For years, the franchise has invested in players who have become big names in Indian cricket. Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya started their careers at the franchise and became an undroppable part of the Indian setup across formats.
Recently, Nita Ambani, owner of the Mumbai Indians, recalled an anecdote of how she met Hardik and his brother Krunal Pandya at a preparatory camp almost a decade ago.
Hardik made his debut in 2015 for the franchise and became a vital cog in the title-winning machine of MI. Later, he captained Gujarat Titans and won the title with them in their debut season. Last year, he returned to the Mumbai Indians as a captain, replacing Rohit Sharma.
“In IPL, we all have a fixed budget, so every team can spend a certain amount of money, so we had to think about new ways of getting talent. When scouting for talent, I used to go to every Ranji Trophy match with my scouts. One day, our scouts took two young, lanky, and thing boys to the camp,” said Nita Ambani in a live chat on the CNN-News 18 YouTube channel.
She recalled that the boys told her that they hadn’t eaten anything apart from Maggi as they had no money. The boys were none other than the Pandya brothers.
“I was talking to them, and they said that for three years, they’ve eaten nothing but Maggi noodles because they’ve had no money. But in them, I saw the spirit, the passion and the hunger that they wanted to make it big. Those two brothers were Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya. In 2015, I bought Hardik Pandya at 10 thousand US dollars in the auction, and today, he’s the proud captain of Mumbai Indians,” she said.
Recalling an anecdote about India’s premier pacer and one of the best bowlers in the world, Jasprit Bumrah, Nita Ambani said that in his early days, he would just talk to the ball.
“Our scouts got a very young cricket with an odd body language and bowling action. We saw him bowl in the nets and it looked like he could just speak to the ball. That was Bumrah, and the rest is history,” said Nita Ambani.
In 2013, a young Bumrah rattled AB de Villiers’ stumps for MI against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, giving him a send-off. The bowler from Gujarat would go on to become an integral part of the Indian bowling setup and eventually one of the best contemporaries bowlers in the world.

Title: Champions Trophy | Before Bumrah’s arrival, it was Shami who carried India’s attack all through, says Laxmipathy Balaji
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-before-bumrahs-arrival-it-was-shami-who-carried-indias-attack-all-through-says-laxmipathy-balaji-9840538/
Content:
Former India pacer Laxmipathy Balaji said Mohammed Shami is the right guy to lead India’s pace attack in the Champions Trophy in absence of injured Jasprit Bumrah.
“Actually, he had out-bowled Bumrah in the 2019 (50-over World Cup) and in the last World Cup (2023). Bumrah is the champion bowler across formats,” Balaji told PTI.
“But Shami has experience and, before Bumrah’s arrival, it was Shami who carried India’s attack all through.
“I think it’s very important. If India has to do well, then Shami has to come good with the new ball. The kind of impact he can make in his first six overs with the new ball, it will play a crucial role for India.
“Old ball is anyway…it is a defensive game now. If he can make early inroads regularly that will give a huge booster to India,” he added.
Balaji feels Shami’s effectiveness has not gone down and since the 34-year-old is making a comeback after ankle injury, he is taking a bit time ton hit the rhythm.
.
“Since that (ankle) injury has happened, there was a little bit of slowness, maybe. It’s natural. But there is nothing you can do about it. It’s part of any sportsperson’s career.
“He has the experience to get over it and he will do it as he bowls more. It’s just about accepting the (physical) condition and continuing his best practices,” he said.
Balaji felt the body of work that Shami has built over the last 12 years makes him an ideal candidate for it.
“Shami is the leader of the pack right now. I mean, he has been the leader of the pack for a long time now. If you see what Shami has done in 12 years of cricket and, especially, in Test cricket, it has been humongous.
“Now, if he starts striking with the new ball the confidence it gives to other bowlers will be huge,” he said.

Title: Sarfaraz Ahmed opens up about MS Dhoni’s iconic photo with his son before 2017 Champions Trophy final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sarfaraz-ahmed-ms-dhoni-iconic-photo-son-before-champions-trophy-final-9840374/
Content:
Former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed shared the story behind his then three-month-old son’s iconic photo with MS Dhoni before the 2017 Champions Trophy final between India and Pakistan.
“The moment happened when his family friends were visiting, and Dhoni happened to come downstairs. He thought it would be a perfect opportunity to capture the moment with his three-month-old son,” Sarfaraz told Cricket Pakistan.
Pakistan-led by Sarfaraz defeated India in the 2017 Champions Trophy final. The former Pakistan captain also explained his conversation with the Indian great after the final, which helped him grow as a cricketer.
“I had a long conversation with Dhoni about wicketkeeping and cricket in general. I asked him how he managed to balance his roles as a wicketkeeper, batsman, and captain. The tips Dhoni shared with me were immensely helpful. He was very humble and generous in offering his advice,” he said.
The former Pakistan captain said despite the high-octane contest, the players from both the sides have shared mutual respect for each other.
“While the lack of bilateral series has affected interactions to some extent, the matches that do take place, especially back-to-back encounters, have led to improved relations,” he said.
“Whenever Indian and Pakistani players meet, there is always mutual respect and friendship, after matches it’s not uncommon to see players like Shoaib Malik, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, and others sitting together, chatting and enjoying each other’s company.”
Pakistan will take India on February 23 at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai.
Pakistan will open their campaign against New Zealand on Wednesday at the National Stadium in Karachi. A day later, India will lock horns against Bangladesh in Dubai.

Title: Champions Trophy: Hopefully Pakistan cricket team will play exactly the way PCB has worked to renovate all stadiums, says Muhammad Yousuf
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-pakistan-cricket-team-pcb-renovate-stadiums-muhammad-yousuf-9840222/
Content:
Legendary Pakistan batter Muhammad Yousuf is hopeful that the Mohammad Rizwan-led team will play in a way that reflects the work the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done to renovate all the stadiums in record time before the Champions Trophy. Defending champions Pakistan will start their campaign against New Zealand on Wednesday at the National Stadium in Karachi.
“I am very excited like any Pakistani. After 29 years, Pakistan is hosting an ICC event,” Muhammad Yousuf told Samaa TV.
“If Pakistan reaches the final, then they will play at home. I wish Pakistan cricket would play exactly the way the PCB has worked to renovate the stadiums.
“Kudos to the PCB for the way they renovated all the stadiums in six months.”
For Yousuf, New Zealand and India are the most balanced sides, but he feels Pakistan will have an edge as they are playing at home. 
 
“It’s tough to pick. It’s a big tournament. Momentum might swing with anyone. For me, New Zealand looks like the most balanced side,” he said.
“They have a good side as per the subcontinent conditions. They have three quality fast bowlers and good spinners. They have a solid top six in batting. The wicketkeeper is an all-rounder; they have two spin-bowling all-rounders.
“India, too, has a balanced side.
“Pakistan has the edge because they are playing in home conditions. But they have to play calculated cricket in the tournament.”
Yousuf also has one piece of advice for the Pakistan cricket team ahead of the marquee event.
“We have played on turning wickets recently. We need to play in the gaps against the spinners. Rotate the strike and play fewer dots.
“We got exposed in the tri-series final against New Zealand. We failed to dominate their spinners in the middle overs.
“You have five fielders in the 30-yard circle; there are too many gaps.”
On the predicted scores during the tournament, Yousuf said: “If it is a double-paced track, then 300 will be a good total. But if it’s a flat track, then teams should be looking to score between 350 and 400.”

Title: Ajinkya Rahane still hopeful of India comeback, says ‘fire and passion’ still there
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ajinkya-rahane-still-hopeful-of-india-comeback-says-fire-and-passion-still-there-9840065/
Content:
The national selectors seem to have moved on from him, but Ajinkya Rahane has not given up hope of putting on an India jersey again. The 36-year-old last played for the country in the West Indies almost two years ago, but still believes he has it in him to contribute to the national side.
Having guided Mumbai to the Ranji Trophy semifinals, quality innings at the business end of the tournament can put Rahane’s name in contention, with a tour of England coming up in the summer.
“There is still fire and passion in me. I’m playing Ranji Trophy at the moment, trying to give my all to the Mumbai team. The goal is clear to make another comeback,” Rahane told The Indian Express a day before he leads defending champions Mumbai against Vidarbha in Nagpur.
He banks on his experience and fitness and believes age is just a number.
“I’m more experienced, but still feel young. I’m fit enough to compete at the highest level. I never get satisfied with my game and don’t take things for granted. I feel there’s more cricket left in me.
“As a batsman, one can play till 40. There are players who have played till the age of 39-40. What matters is fitness. We need more experienced players, plus a few youngsters, in the team. So that they can learn,” the veteran argued.
The last few years of his international career were not too productive, with his last hundred coming in the famous victory in Melbourne in December 2020. But he thinks he was making useful contributions to the team.
“Post Covid, there has been a drastic drop in batting averages of everyone because of the kind of pitches we played on. Only the top order has the advantage on such tracks. I am not giving excuses. I don’t have any regrets because I know whenever the team wanted me to deliver, I did. Contributions are not necessarily in the form of big hundreds, it could be a 70, 80 or 50,” Rahane reasoned.

Title: ‘My mother used to babysit to earn extra money. Those memories are in my mind’: Ajinkya Rahane explains his philosophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/my-mother-used-to-babysit-to-earn-extra-money-those-memories-are-in-my-mind-ajinkya-rahane-explains-his-philosophy-9840038/
Content:
Playing 85 Tests for India and scoring more than 5,000 runs is a remarkable achievement, but success has never gone to Ajinkya Rahane’s head due to the values he lives by.
Coming from a humble background and having to work hard to succeed in cricket has ensured he remained level-headed. Also, watching his parents work hard to maintain the family has had a profound impact on him.
“I used to come from Dombivali, the train journey was the most challenging for me and I used to travel alone from the age of 8 because my father had to go to office,” Rahane recalls in a conversation with The Indian Express. “I come from a lower-middle-class family. My mother used to babysit to earn extra money because my father’s salary wasn’t enough to make ends meet. Those memories are in my mind and that is why I try to be grounded. This fame and money has come only due to this game.”
That’s the reason he tries to guide younger players, who suddenly get a lot of money and fame quickly and are at a risk of losing their way. Rahane stresses that one should never forget one’s roots.
“I don’t like to go into their personal space but as a leader, if I feel I need to tell them anything, I will. I have seen players with talent but wrong choices and wrong friends took them astray. It’s important not to forget where we all come from. Many times when a player is having a great run, you see people with them. Suddenly, if things go wrong, the same people vanish. So it is very important to know who your true friends are ,” he says.
Rahane is also very particular about how he spends his money, and took his time before buying a new car.
“This is where my family values came in. They never said don’t spend, but they only said if it’s needed, do it. I bought a car very late in my life, I used to take a lift from Nilesh Kulkarni, Avishkar Salvi or Pravin Tambe. I bought a second-hand WagonR when I played for India. People said bada car le but for me it was about travelling in comfort. I wanted to invest wisely. After two years, I bought a Honda City,” Rahane added.
================================================================================

Title: Ajinkya Rahane: ‘I got an offer to become an expert. It was easy and good money but within me, a person is saying I still can (play)’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ajinkya-rahane-i-got-an-offer-to-become-an-expert-it-was-easy-and-good-money-but-within-me-a-person-is-saying-i-still-can-play-9840007/
Content:
Not just Ajinkya Rahane himself, but according to the veteran, people he meets during his travels and assignments also believe he should be in the Indian Test team. This, he says, motivates him to give another shot at an international comeback and not take the option of becoming a television pundit.
“Be it airport, hotel, security check, ground, county cricket, everywhere I have gone, they all said: Ajju bhai, aapko team mein hona chahiye. It feels nice. It motivates me to give it a try, at least I would have given my best in the last few years of my career,” Rahane told The Indian Express.
But irrespective of whether or not he returns to international cricket, Rahane will forever be remembered for leading an Indian team missing several of its first-choice stars to a comeback series win for the ages in Australia in 2020-21. That too, after being knocked over for 36 in the first Test. His tempo-setting hundred in the second Test in Melbourne gave the team belief.
“When I came back after BGT, I knew that I was captain for that period only and will be back to being vice-captain,” he said.
With memories of that incredible achievement in his mind, it was all the more difficult for Rahane to watch the Border-Gavaskar Trophy this time round from home. But he didn’t take the easy option of a television contract as a cricket expert.
“ Yes (it was tough). I got an offer to become an expert. It was easy and good money but within me, a person is saying I still can (play). Getting picked or not is not in my hands. Down the line, I don’t want a situation where I feel that yeh expert assignment mein baad mein bhi le sakta tha. I could have given one last push,” he explained his thought process.
================================================================================

Title: Ajinkya Rahane: ‘People say I need to be in the news … I don’t have a PR team, my PR is my cricket’

Content:
It may seem far-fetched at the moment, but Ajinkya Rahane still hopes to make a comeback to international cricket. The national selectors may have put their trust in a young batch of players, but the 36-year-old, who last played for India in the West Indies almost two years ago, believes he is fit and can still contribute to the team. A day before the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Vidarbha, at a stage when two big knocks can again put his name in contention ,the Mumbai skipper spoke to Devendra Pandey about his desire, and how tough it was for him to watch the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at home.
EXCERPTS:
Obviously, I’m more experienced, but still feel young. I’m fit enough to compete at the highest level. I am passionate and love this game. There is hunger to do well. I never get satisfied with my game and don’t take things for granted. The fire is still burning inside me to play at the highest level. I feel there’s more cricket left in me.
I was always shy, now I have opened up. My focus has been to play cricket and go home. Nobody told me that going ahead, certain things will be needed. Today also, sometimes I feel ki bus cricket khelo, ghar jao. Now I am told I need to speak up, talk about my hard work. People say you need to be in the news … I don’t have a PR team, my only PR is my cricket. I have now realised that staying in the news is important. Otherwise, people think that I’m out of the circle.
Test cricket. There is still fire and passion in me. I’m playing Ranji Trophy at the moment, trying to give my all to the Mumbai team. The goal is clear to make another comeback. When I was dropped a few years ago, I made runs and was picked for the World Test Championship final and then was dropped again. But what is in my control? To play.
I did well in domestic cricket and in the IPL, and was called again. Whenever an experienced player makes a comeback, one knows that he will get 2-3 series. I knew that South Africa was a challenging series and I was expecting a call, but I wasn’t picked. I felt bad because I have been serving for so long.
The number which I used to bat, whatever contributions I made were crucial. Post Covid, there has been a drastic drop in batting averages of everyone because of the kind of pitches we played on. Only the top order has the advantage on such tracks. I am not giving excuses. I don’t have any regrets because I know whenever the team wanted me to deliver, I did. Contributions are not necessarily in the form of big hundreds, it could be a 70, 80 or 50.
That’s the sad part. For me, it’s not about the runs, it’s about the contribution. As a batsman, one wants to score big runs but don’t forget the conditions one is playing in. I’m not the one who will go and scream, criticise pitches, because every team has a strategy and that’s how pitches are being prepared. But the reality is that the averages have gone down for top players too. It’s not only us but globally, everyone has struggled. This is the reality about which we don’t talk in public.
I’m not the person who will go and ask why I’m being dropped. There was no communication. Many said ‘go and talk’ but one can only talk when the other person is ready to talk. If he is not ready, there is no point fighting. I wanted to talk one on one. I never messaged. I felt odd when I was dropped after the WTC final because I had worked hard for it. I thought I would be there for the next series. There is no point cribbing. I can only do what is in my hands. There is a belief that I will make a comeback.
I was very happy with it. I was moving well. My fitness was good. I improved my shots.
When I came back after BGT, I knew that I was captain for that period only and will be back to being vice-captain. There was no thought that ahead there would be a bumpy ride.
Maybe. We won because of a team and not because I was captain. There could be one decision which I made that went right, but it was a team effort.
I never thought of it. I always think that every action will have its reaction. My friends said I should be in the media, keep talking to them as the team won under you, but I feel joh hona hai woh hoga.
Yes. Previously, I was dropped despite doing well. So somewhere I feel I can still serve the Indian team. Cricket is still left in me.
If you ask me, I can still give my best and my intentions are good. For me, it’s all about the country.
I got an offer to become an expert. It was easy and good money but within me, a person is saying I still can (play). Getting picked or not is not in my hands. Down the line, I don’t want a situation where I feel that yeh expert assignment mein baad mein bhi le sakta tha. I could have given one last push.
Yes. Be it airport, hotel, security check, ground, county cricket, everywhere I have gone, they all said Ajju bhai, aapko team mein hona chahiye. It feels nice. It motivates me to give it a try, at least I would have given my best in the last few years of my career.
He was special and a warrior, who never gave up.
As a batsman, one can play till 40. There are players who have played till the age of 39-40. What matters is fitness. We need more experienced players, plus a few youngsters, in the team. So that they can learn. We grew by watching seniors and all of them played till 39-40. When we got an opportunity, we did well. Hunger is key, and the right attitude.
When I came into the team, I learnt by watching seniors. I was benched for around two years. There was hardly any time when I got to bat at the nets. Now every member gets a chance to bat at the nets, but in my early days, only those who were playing used to get a chance. I used to visualise watching them. We can’t go and ask for batting practice. Now things have changed. One used to get batting after five days. We were lucky that (VVS) Laxman, Rahul (Dravid) and Sachin (Tendulkar) bhai were around. The only thing they used to tell us was to be humble. Whatever you are doing, first ask yourself, is it necessary? If yes, do it. All three were the same in terms of thinking.
I used to come from Dombivali, the train journey was the most challenging for me and I used to travel alone from the age of 8 because my father had to go to office. I come from a lower- middle-class family. My mother used to babysit to earn extra money because my father’s salary wasn’t enough to make ends meet. Those memories are in my mind and that is why I try to be grounded. This fame and money has come only due to this game.
I don’t like to go into their personal space but as a leader, if I feel I need to tell them anything, I will. I have seen players with talent but wrong choices and wrong friends took them astray. It’s important not to forget where we all come from. Many times when a player is having a great run, you see people with them. Suddenly, if things go wrong, the same people vanish. So it is important to know who your true friends are.
I never have. I knew this money was coming because of my cricket. This is where my family values came in. They never said don’t spend, but they only said if it’s needed, do it. I bought a car very late in my life, I used to take a lift from Nilesh Kulkarni, Avishkar Salvi or Pravin Tambe. I bought a second-hand WagonR when I played for India. People said bada car le but for me it was about travelling in comfort. I wanted to invest wisely. After two years, I bought a Honda City.
I don’t think so. At least, I’m playing cricket. My attitude is the same once I cross the rope, be it for a franchise, Mumbai or for India. Mumbai has given me everything and it’s my duty.

Title: WPL 2025: Priya Mishra signals her arrival, Ash Gardner continues good form as Gujarat Giants defeat UP Warriorz

If words could describe Priya Mishra’s wicket celebrations, it would be: ‘I belong here’. The young legspinner made her mark in the Women’s Premier League fixture between Gujarat Giants and UP Warriorz on Sunday and brought out her signature move of pointing to the ground. The 20-year-old from Delhi picked up three important wickets in Gujarat’s six-wicket win in Vadodara on Sunday. UPW finished with 143 for 9 in their quota of 20 overs. Mishra finished with figures of 25/3, while Gardner and Dottin picked two wickets each. In reply, GG chased the target down in 18 overs, scoring 144/4.
Priya first brought out the celebration as she took the catch of Uma Chetry off Deandra Dottin’s bowling. It continued as she struck twice in her second over, first trapping experienced Tahila McGrath in front for a duck (albeit a dubious decision) and then knocking off Grace Harris’s stump two deliveries later. She returned in the 15th over to snap up the highest scorer of UP’s innings, skipper Deepti Sharma. Gujarat captain Ash Gardner had praised the growth of Priya before the start of the WPL, and the youngster proved her captain right with a match-winning performance.
Gardner opted to field after winning the toss, the bowling line-up packed a punch together and never let the UP Warriorz batting line-up take off. UP started explosively, with Kiran Navgire hitting three fours in the first two overs, but Dottin sent her packing in the second over. Vrinda Dinesh departed in the next over, falling to the spin of Gardner. Uma Chetry and Deepti Sharma tried to stabilize the ship, but Dottin and Mishra wreaked havoc to send half the UPW team back into the pavilion.
Gujarat started poorly, with Grace Harris getting the prized wicket of Beth Mooney in the first over. Sophie Ecclestone knocked over Dayalan Hemalatha in the second over to make it 2/2. But Gardner’s 52 off 32 balls doused any hope of a UPW fightback.
Gardner and experienced batter Laura Wooldvaart steadied the ship and counter-attacked, taking 20 runs in the fifth over bowled by Saima Thakor. The experienced duo recorded a partnership of 55 runs before Ecclestone knocked over Wooldvaart in the ninth over. However, Gardner continued her attack and scored a quickfire 50 in 28 balls, for a second straight half century. She holed out in 12th over to Navgire off McGrath.
The runs kept flowing for Gujarat as Harleen Deol (34*) and Dottin (33*) combined to add 58 runs for the final wicket and drove them past the finish line, recording the first win of the season.
Gardner was named player of the match for her bowling figures of 2/39, a fine catch to dismiss Deepti and a blistering knock with the bat
Brief Scores: UP Warriorz 143/9 (Deepti 39, Priya 3/25, Dottin 2/34) lost to Gujarat Giants 144/4 (Gardner 52, Deol 34*, Ecclestone 2/16) by six wkts

Title: IPL schedule announced: Eden Gardens to host final after decade and other talking points

The iconic Eden Gardens will host the Indian Premier League final after a decade as the much-awaited schedule for the 2025 edition was announced on Sunday. The league will start from Kolkata on 22nd March and return to the same venue after 64 days on 25th May for the final.
Current champions Kolkata Knight Riders and perennial under-achievers Royal Challengers Bengaluru will play the opening game on 22 March 2025 in a match that will pit two new captains in all likelihood. The 2025 season will once more have 74 matches spread out across 13 venues and will include 12 double-headers. Last season’s runner-ups Sunrisers Hyderabad will face Rajasthan Royals on 23rd March and arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians will take each other in the second fixture of the day. While the afternoon games will begin at 03.30 PM IST, the evening games will begin from 07.30 PM IST.
The league stage will conclude on 18th May 2025 with Lucknow Super Giants taking on Sunrisers Hyderabad in Ekana Stadium, Lucknow. After a day’s break, the playoffs will start on the 20th May with Qualifier 1 in Hyderabad. Eliminator (21st May) will also be played in the southern city. Qualifier 2 (23rd May), and Final (25th May) will be played subsequently in Kolkata.
The IPL final returns to Kolkata after a ten-year absence. Eden Gardens last hosted the final in 2015, when the Mumbai Indians defeated the Chennai Super Kings to win their second-ever IPL trophy. The last IPL final was played at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai where KKR defeated SRH to win their third IPL trophy.
Delhi Capitals will play their home games in Visakhapatnam and at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. Punjab Kings will play four home games at the New PCA Stadium, New Chandigarh. The picturesque Dharamsala will host three home games of PBKS. As has been the case recently Rajasthan Royals will play home games in two venues too. Samson’s side will play their two home games in Guwahati – where they host KKR and CSK – and play the remainder of the home games at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. Overall, 13 venues will be play hosts across the tournament.
The first El Clasico of IPL 2025 – between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings – will come as early as Day 2, with Chepauk hosting the rivals on 23 March in the third match. There will be two clashes between the heavyweights again, with Wankhede hosting the return affair on 20 April. CSK have a blockbuster start to the season, with their first two matches in Chepauk being against MI and RCB. Rishabh Pant will have a very quick reunion as his new side LSG take on his former team DC in the fourth match of the season.

Title: Aakash Chopra on Pakistan Cricket: ‘Their graph goes up and down… like their country’

Pakistan has reached the final of 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. Since then their ICC campigns have been nothing short of dissapointment. In addition to not only reaching the playoff stages of the tournament they also have seen upsets against associatate nations in these campaigns. Aakash Chopra speaking on his YouTube channel would compare the cricket team to country.
“Secondly, they are inconsistent. Their graph goes up and down. They rarely have a flat line. They are probably like their country. Their country also goes like that, up and down. The same is reflected in their cricket team,” Chopra said “They are volatile. They are an unpredictable side. Pakistan’s middle name is unpredictable. So imploding under pressure and an unpredictable side, those are a couple of issues. Can Pakistan overcome that? That is my question mark because they will be under pressure.”
“Pakistan’s weakness is not a weakness of today. It’s a perennial weakness. Of course, they are the defending champions in the Champions Trophy, but the truth is that they get stuck under pressure. They lost to the USA in the last ICC event (2024 T20 World Cup) and didn’t qualify for the second round,” he would say. “They reached the final in the 2022 T20 World Cup for sure but they were totally missing in the 2023 ODI World Cup. So this is a team that just implodes under pressure. They just go completely missing. So you will have to agree that is one of Pakistan’s weaknesses,” Chopra added.
However, Pakistan are the hosts for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025- A silveware which they did manage to bag in 2017. Though the competetion is being held in home conditions, Pakistan aren’t still considered among hot favorites to win the tournament. They kick start their campaign against New Zealand, meet India and conclude their group stage by playing against Bangladesh.

Title: Why Gujarat left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai stands out: Heaps of wickets, unorthodox run-up and high-jump-inspired action
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/why-gujarat-left-arm-spinner-siddharth-desai-stands-out-heaps-of-wickets-unorthodox-run-up-and-high-jump-inspired-action-9839546/
Content:
Ahmedabad thoroughbred Siddharth Desai cannot put a finger on why his cricketing graph hasn’t witnessed adrenaline-pumping surges like the ones he experienced at the Universal Studios in Florida in the off-season.
He cannot shake off the feeling of dizzying thrills from a dozen rollercoaster rides at the American film production giant’s exotic theme park resort, zealously recollecting it as the “best day of my life.” But when the discussion returns to cricket, a forlorn gaze stretches to the distance. Unlike a Universal movie set or the head-spinning amusement frills, the left-arm spinner has yet to realise a filmy twist to his First-Class career despite stockpiling near-ridiculous feats along the way.
Perhaps the Ranji Trophy 2024-25 semi-final, starting Monday, will usher in clarity to Gujarat’s lead spinner as he completes a circle. Eight years since making his First-Class debut and announcing his arrival with a six-wicket haul against Kerala at a quaint stadium in Nadiad, Desai gears up to face the same opposition in a knockout contest at the mighty Narendra Modi Stadium in his hometown.
Unlike his veteran Kerala spin counterparts, Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarvate, Desai can dream hard and even admit being harshly let down already. In only seven seasons since his first Ranji appearance at 17, the 24-year-old Desai has pocketed 179 wickets at a sub-25 average, striking every 48 deliveries. A broader context places Desai fourth on the all-time Ranji charts for most wickets before turning 25. With two potential games left in his season, he could scale up to the second spot on that list behind Piyush Chawla (198) before calling in his next birthday in August.
With Gujarat making a semi-final spot for the first time since 2019-20, Desai may concur that a lack of consistent presence in the knockouts for five years could have deprived him of an India A berth. But he is here to make amends.
“For four to five seasons, I have been taking close to 30 wickets a season. So it does bother me that I am not even getting into the Duleep Trophy or the India A side. It does bother me, but it keeps me motivated that ‘no, I don’t have to stop.’ I had kept a target of 50 for this season and then I will get that chance,” Desai tells The Indian Express as he leads Gujarat’s bowling charts with 35 scalps this Ranji edition.
Desai made heads turn with a record-breaking nine-wicket haul (9/36) last month when the second phase of the Ranji season resumed against Uttarakhand. On a dewy January morning at the Gujarat College Ground, the young tweaker was thrown the new ball by his seam-bowling captain, Chintan Gaja and coach Ramesh Powar.
Unlike other men of his tribe, Desai is an outlier who specialises in prising out opponents with the fresh red SG ball. Continuing a 15-over burst from one end, Desai razed down the Uttarakhand order with nine jolts, seven either bowled or leg-before. Raring to have a shot at the No. 11 bat in his next over, Desai was stumped when teammate Vishal Jayswal’s final delivery clinked the off pole.
“Vishal told me he won’t bowl in the stumps and keep it outside. Five bowls in and the last ball was also outside the off stump. But the ball didn’t turn and went in with the arm to clip the stumps. It was disappointing when I was this close,” Desai admits as he missed out on becoming only the fourth bowler to record the perfect 10 in the Ranji Trophy.
Desai is fast building a name for entering such manic sprees that he turns almost unplayable. When Karnataka set motoring on a 110-run chase at the Motera in January 2024 with a 50-run opening stand, Desai flipped the game on its head with six wickets in 26 balls, including the likes of Mayank Agarwal, Devdutt Padikkal and Manish Pandey. Gujarat would eke out their narrowest Ranji win, bundling Karnataka on 103 with Desai finishing 7/42.
From a heap of left-armers in the circuit, Desai is a quick spot on the field with his unconventional, almost high-jump-inspired action, which begins with an unorthodox run-up and high arm that blends from over-to-round the stumps to the right-hander. A cricket-crazy dad thrust the sport upon him so early that Desai had no time to look beyond his shoulder. Desai’s late father, who ran a travel and tours company in the city, was a regular at all of his son’s matches.
“From when I was seven and right until the time of his death, I don’t think he missed any match, local or Ranji or whatever, that I played. He always wanted a cricketer in the family and would try to get me to start playing when I was a child saying I wouldn’t be fit if I didn’t play. He used to review my game every day and share new inputs,” he says.
Yet to chart a space on a full-blown white-ball cricket calendar, Desai still awaits his Gujarat T20 call-up. During an extended off-season, he catches up with his two elder sisters in the United States with the latest trip ticking off the roller coaster marathon from the bucket list.
Hope floats this summer on the field too with Gujarat’s bowling heavily pinned around Desai’s bursts. Relishing his Cheteshwar Pujara bait-trap from the quarter-final win over Saurashtra last week, Desai sure is dreaming of that Duleep Trophy and India A calls if he can push Gujarat back into the final after eight years.
But Kerala will be no pushovers after braving the J&K challenge on a Pune flatbed with dogged batting rearguards. With new heroes emerging beyond his old shoulders, Sachin Baby and Co. sported renewed confidence in the nets after being teased with a greenish strip on match eve. While Kerala deliberate including an extra pacer in the quest to make their maiden Ranji final, Desai’s golden spin arm hopes to leave a telling mark on the tie and deliver his vaguely static career’s first big break from his Amdavad backyard.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Ending near-3-decade wait, Pakistan full of excitement to host major ICC event
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-3-decade-wait-pakistan-excitement-host-9839534/
Content:
The last time Pakistan staged a major ICC tournament was 29 years ago and with a median age of 20.6, as per 2023 statistics, most of the country’s population wasn’t around to experience such excitement that was last felt at the 1996 World Cup. And by all accounts, the hot topic in drawing-room discussions, for weeks, was whether the renovation work at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium and National Stadium in Karachi would be over in time. It was only after the recent tri-series against New Zealand and South Africa in Lahore and Karachi that there was a collective sigh of relief.
With the ICC Champions Trophy just a couple of days away, there is a festive atmosphere in the country. It has been reported that cinema halls are preparing for live broadcast of all Pakistan matches, including the showdown against India in Dubai on February 23. From Peshawar and Quetta to host cities Karachi, Rawalpindi and Lahore, people are planning community screening in localities.
“Finally, something has united us all. It already feels like the tournament has begun. After all, Pakistan has been waiting for this moment forever,” says the 68-year-old stalwart Mudassar Nazar, who was a mainstay of the Pakistan team in the late 1970s and 80s. “Since the last time we hosted an ICC event, we have changed a lot as a nation. The political scene is totally different, cities have undergone huge makeovers. But the love for the game hasn’t changed. The Pakistan public’s love for cricketers hasn’t diminished. They have been thirsty for a really long time,” Nazar adds.
That tickets were sold out for all Pakistan matches within minutes of going live is a clear indication. Even for non-Pakistan matches, the word going around is that there is heavy demand for tickets.
Intikhab Alam, manager of the Pakistan team in 1992 and 2009, when they won the 50-over and 20-over world titles respectively – is still hurt by India not travelling across the border but feels this is the moment for his country to show the world it is as safe for cricket as anywhere else.
“It will be a catalyst to inspire a new generation, who will get to see all the big stars of world cricket. We have been hosting bilateral series of late, but a world event like the Champions Trophy, with the best playing in your own backyard, is totally different. It has been 29 years and we all want to impress the world,” Alam says.
For an entire generation, logging into YouTube or listening to anecdotes from elders are the only link to the 1996 World Cup. Back then, Pakistan were standing on an equal footing with India, if not better, on the cricket field. But to host a big tournament 29 years later, it has had to move heaven and earth, especially after the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009, which kept international cricket away from the country till 2017.
“They have to thank the PSL (Pakistan Super League) for it. It was where it all started,” Nazar, who has been involved with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in various capacities, says. “In 2015, the Kenyan team came for an A tour. But thereafter, it was the PSL that brought cricket back to Pakistan. The PCB used it to win the trust of the players that it is safe to tour Pakistan. From there on, it has been a steady progress towards hosting this event.”
There was a time when the likes of Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels of the West Indies, England’s Dawid Malan and Chris Jordan, South Africa’s Morne van Wyk and Zimbabwe’s Sean Ervine took a huge leap of faith and travelled to Lahore, where they stayed for less than 24 hours, to play the PSL final. They had landed in Lahore to empty roads and security usually reserved for heads of states. When the two English cricketers returned from the ‘quickest shower ever’ in the dressing room, the security staff had already packed their bags and loaded them in the team bus to ensure they flew out of Lahore as soon as possible.
Since then every major team except India has toured the country. “Having India would have been the biggest of them all, but we keep mixing politics and cricket. The Pakistan public would have loved to watch Indians play – some of their players have such a huge fan following that they would have been surprised,” Nazar says. “In 2005-06, when I coached the Punjab Ranji team, I was showered with endless love and affection. Since then, I’ve been waiting for a moment to repay my Indian friends by having them over. I hope in my lifetime, I will get the opportunity,” says the 83-year-old Alam, who shared a strong friendship with the late Bishan Singh Bedi.
As ever, the only mood-spoiler for the Pakistan public could be its own team led by Mohammad Rizwan. After the 2023 World Cup debacle, where they failed to reach the semifinals, with an eye on putting a strong team at the Champions Trophy it is hosting, the cricket board hired former India coach Gary Kirsten to guide the white-ball team. But he lasted less than six months.
Unlike in 1996 when it arguably had the biggest talent pool and was tipped as favourites to defend their World Cup crown, in 2025 they don’t enjoy that much confidence to retain the title they clinched by beating India at The Oval in 2017. In a tournament where every match counts, in Pakistan’s case it is all the more challenging as the tournament opener is against New Zealand – against whom they lost both matches in the recent tri-series. If they lose that, their match against India, against whom they usually struggle in ICC events, will become a must-win encounter.
“There will be pressure, but they have to feed off the energy in the crowd. I’m not going to read too much into the tri-series loss because it is a preparatory tournament. Given what’s at stake, if the team does well, it will definitely propel the mood of the nation to new highs,” Nazar says.

Title: Express Exclusive: PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi: ‘Champions Trophy is an opportunity to show Pakistan’s ability to host top-tier international cricket’

Content:
The moment that Pakistan long waited for is here, with the country set to host its first International Cricket Council event in nearly 30 years. A decade back, after the terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka team in 2009, international cricket had come to a standstill. However, since 2017 from hosting the Pakistan Super League to successfully hosting bilateral series against all Test teams barring India, the Pakistan Cricket Board has managed to put its country back on cricketing map. With the Champions Trophy set to begin on February 19 in Karachi, in an exclusive interaction with The Indian Express, PCB chair Mohsin Naqvi, also the country’s Interior Minister, shares the challenges the board overcame along the way.
Can you explain how big an undertaking it was to get everything ready for Pakistan’s first multi-nation event in 30 years?
Our stadiums last underwent significant renovations for the 1996 World Cup. Since then, the global cricketing landscape has evolved tremendously. We recognised that this event was an opportunity to showcase Pakistan’s ability to host top-tier international cricket, ensuring that our facilities meet the highest global standards for players, officials, and fans alike. The dedication and expertise of our workforce have been instrumental in transforming Gaddafi Stadium and National Stadium Karachi into world-class venues.
PCB has hosted bilateral series in recent times. But when it comes to the Champions Trophy, we are talking of a multi-nation event. Could you talk about the assurances that foreign teams sought?
Since 2019, all major Test-playing nations – except India – have toured Pakistan. Some multiple times. England and New Zealand, for instance, have visited three times in as many years, and foreign players regularly participate in the PSL. As a result, they are already familiar with Pakistan’s world-class playing conditions, operational efficiency and robust security measures.
That said, organising a multi-team ICC event presents a different set of challenges compared to a single-team bilateral series. This means constant coordination with the ICC across various operational aspects, ensuring alignment on security, logistics and venue readiness.
How much has the PCB spent to renovate the facilities at the three stadiums hosting the tournament and what sort of revenue is it expecting?
While financial details remain confidential, it is important to note that the PCB has made a significant investment in upgrading our cricket infrastructure. This has been fully funded by the PCB without any external grants and it will strengthen Pakistan’s cricketing ecosystem.
There is always a concern around security in Pakistan. Did you need to provide specific assurances around security? What are the arrangements made for the teams and at the grounds?
As with any ICC event, the host nation must submit a comprehensive security plan for review by ICC security experts and representatives from participating countries. Our security plan was presented to the ICC Board in October 2024 and received unanimous approval. This plan ensures that all necessary protocols are in place to provide a safe and seamless experience for teams, officials, and spectators alike.
Would you say securing an event like the Champions Trophy was the goal when Pakistan started staging the PSL at home?
The PSL played a pivotal role in reintegrating international cricket into Pakistan. It provided a platform for foreign players to experience Pakistan’s hospitality, security arrangements and cricketing passion firsthand. Once we successfully staged home international series and consistently delivered PSL editions at world-class standards, the ICC accepted and recognised Pakistan’s readiness to host a global event.
The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is a culmination of those efforts. Our successful hosting of this event will further enhance Pakistan’s credentials, positioning us as a strong contender for more ICC men’s events in the next events cycle.

Just a week before India face Pakistan in Dubai, vice-captain Salman Ali Agha has said that winning the Champions Trophy is a bigger goal for his team than beating their arch-rivals in a match in the group stages.
The India-Pakistan match is usually the marquee game in any International Cricket Council (ICC) tournament and garners a high set of viewers in a cricket calendar that relishes these clashes. When Agha was asked about whether he viewed the clash as more important than winning the Champions trophy, the 31-year-old made it clear that winning one game wouldn’t matter if Pakistan wouldn’t be able to lift the trophy in a tournament with home advantage.
“The Pakistan-India match is the biggest, but winning the Champions Trophy is more important. If we beat India but don’t win the tournament, that win holds no value. However, if we lose to India but lift the trophy, that’s a bigger achievement. Our goal is to perform well and win,” he remarked.
Agha also spoke about the trophy being held in Pakistan and how it would be special to lift the trophy in Lahore. “I am excited for the Champions Trophy—Pakistan hosting an ICC event is special. As a Lahore native, lifting the trophy in my hometown would be a dream come true. The Pakistan team has the potential to win,” said Agha.
He also spoke about the new role given to him as vice-captain of the Pakistan cricket team and said that victories in Australia and South Africa had emboldened the team ahead of the Champions Trophy.
“I am really enjoying cricket and the new role given to me. Being vice-captain comes with responsibility but also a sense of freedom. The victories in Australia and South Africa gave me a lot of confidence, and I always prepare thoroughly a day before the match,” he shared.

Title: IPL 2025: Mujeeb-ur-Rahman replaces Allah Ghazanfar in Mumbai Indians

Content:
Mumbai Indians has picked Mujeeb-ur-Rahman as a replacement for Allah Ghazanfar for the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.
Mujeeb-ur-Rahman – a right-arm off-spinner – has played 19 IPL matches and has 19 IPL wickets against his name. He joins MI for Rs 2 crore.
“Mujeeb was one of the youngest ever players to have represented Afghanistan and made an instant impact with the ball leading to an IPL debut at the age of 17,” Mumbai Indians said in a statement.
“Mujeeb has played over 300 T20 (international and domestic) games taking closer to 330 wickets at an economy of around 6.5.  Mumbai Indians wish Ghazanfar a speedy recovery.”
Teenage Afghanistan off-spinner AM Ghazanfar has been ruled out of both the ICC Champions Trophy and the IPL due to a lower back fracture that will keep him on the sidelines for at least four months, the Afghanistan Cricket Board had announced.
Ghazanfar sustained the injury during Afghanistan’s tour of Zimbabwe late last year, sidelining him for “at least four months”.
“AM Ghazanfar has been ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy due to a fracture in the L4 vertebra (located in the lower back), specifically in the left pars interarticularis,” the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) posted on ‘X’.
“He sustained the injury during Afghanistan’s recent tour of Zimbabwe and will be sidelined for a minimum of four months, remaining under treatment during this period,” it added.
The IPL is scheduled to take place from March 21 to May 25 and Ghazanfar was to make his maiden appearance at the event after being bought by Mumbai Indians at the IPL mega auction for Rs 4.8 crore.

Title: Yashasvi Jaiswal ruled out of Ranji Trophy semifinal with ankle injury

Content:
Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has been ruled out from Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy semifinal clash against Vidarbha due to ankle injury. The semifinal will be played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA) Stadium in Nagpur from Monday.
Mumbai captain Ajinkya Rahane told The Indian Express that the batter felt pain in his ankle and would not be available for the fixture.
“We also got to know today (Jaiswal won’t be available). We all were surprised, but anyway, as a team, we are prepared, and we want whoever is playing to give their best,” Rahane said.
Jaiswal was picked for the final four of the Ranji Trophy after being drafted as only a reserve in the Indian Champions Trophy 2025 squad.
He will travel to the BCCI’s center of excellence in Bengaluru for further assessment and treatment.
Though he is a non-traveling reserve, the injury has cast doubt on the batter’s availability for the upcoming Champions Trophy starting on February 19.
While Indian selectors will have to look at the prospect of adding a new reserve to the squad, Mumbai selectors are unlikely to add anyone to their squad.
Jaiswal, who made his debut earlier this month against England, was part of India’s preliminary Champions Trophy squad but was later moved to the reserves as the selectors preferred spinner Varun Chakravarthy.
Jaiswal made 15 off 22 balls in his only ODI appearance before being dropped from the next two matches of the three-match series against England.
Jaiswal, who was in the preliminary squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy, was on Tuesday moved to the list of non-travelling substitutes alongside Shivam Dube and Mohammed Siraj, meaning they will travel to Dubai for India’s matches only if necessary.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025: Mohammad Amir raises doubts over Haris Rauf availability for Pakistan
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-2025-mohammad-amir-raises-doubts-over-haris-rauf-availability-for-pakistan-9838790/
Content:
Former Pakistan pace spearhead Mohammad Amir raised doubts over whether Pakistan would be able to field Haris Rauf for the upcoming Champions Trophy, saying that the true nature of his injury would mean a longer recovery and rehabilitation period than expected.
Rauf had sustained strain to his muscle in the lower chest during the first ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand in the Tri-nation ODI series. He was then rested as a precaution by the Pakistan Cricket Board and not played throughout the series.
“The injury is not serious and he is expected to be fully recovered for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, which commences in Karachi on 19 February,” read a PCB statement.
But Amir has said that if the injury is a side-strain, then the recovery time could be as long as six weeks, followed by rehab. That timeline would mean that Rauf could likely miss out on playing for Pakistan, and add to the growing list of pace bowlers who are going to miss out on the Champions Trophy, joining the likes of India’s Jasprit Bumrah and Australia’s Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc.
“If Haris Rauf has a side strain, he cannot recover fully before six weeks. If it’s just stiffness, then that’s different,” said Amir. “If it is a grade one or two side strain, no matter what, it will take six weeks, and then the rehab starts,” said Amir, according to GeoSuper.tv.
“I got this injury during PSL a couple of years ago. If it is a side strain of grade one or two, then I don’t think he can play the Champions Trophy. I think it will be foolish to risk his career for three matches of a tournament because he won’t be able to give his 100 per cent,” he added.

Content:
Former New Zealand pacer Tim Southee feels Mitchell Santner-led Blackcaps can go all the way in the upcoming Champions Trophy. New Zealand will start their Champions Trophy campaign against defending champions and hosts Pakistan on Wednesday in Karachi.
“If you look at the track record of New Zealand in ICC events, they are always there or thereabouts,” Southee told the ICC.
“In a tournament like the Champions Trophy, if you get on a bit of a roll, anything can happen. I’d love to see the Blackcaps there and hopefully lifting the trophy at the end.”
New Zealand rounded off perfect preparation for the Champions Trophy by thumping Pakistan by five wickets in the tri-nation series final on Friday.
Five days before the teams meet again to open the Champions Trophy, host Pakistan was dismissed for 242 and New Zealand cruised to 243-5 in the 46th over.
Fast bowler Will O’Rourke staked his claim for Wednesday’s opener with 4 for 43.
“Will O’Rourke, in the Test game we’ve seen what he can do. He’s still so young but he’s got the all the attributes that are going to set him up to have a lot of success in international cricket. I’m looking forward to watching him in his first ICC event,” he said.
“Will is a man of few words but certainly listens and wants to get better. Nathan Smith has a real confidence about him, and believes in himself which I think you need at this level.
“Will is still learning, and the Tri-Nation Series – being exposed to those conditions – will be great for him. We know he’s got the pace and bounce, he’s got great skills. He just keeps growing, we’ve seen that in the Test game and he’s continued to get better.
“His game is far from finished but I’m sure he’ll be a massive asset to New Zealand cricket across all three formats for a long time to come.”

Title: India vs Pakistan: Rashid Latif says 1996 World Cup quarterfinal loss at Bengaluru was painful

India vs Pakistan: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif says the loss against India in the quarterfinals of the 1996 World Cup in Bengaluru still haunts him and called it one of his worst memories in his cricketing career.
“The loss against India in the quarterfinals of the 1996 World Cup in Bengaluru. It still haunts me. When I returned home to Karachi, I used to wake up at night,” Latif said on Geo News show “Hasna Mana Hai.”
“We lost in the 2003 ODI World Cup as well, but that loss in Bengaluru was painful.
“The kind of start Aamer Sohail and Saeed Anwar gave us, we failed to capitalize on that,” he said.
Batting first, India posted 187 for 8. Navjot Singh Sidhu scored a remarkable 93, but it was Ajay Jadeja’s innings that proved to be the difference. Jadeja smashed a 25-ball 45, including his onslaught against Waqar Younis, whose first eight overs had yielded 27 runs, but whose final two were smashed for 22 and 18 respectively.

“Ajay’s knock was terrific. That was the game-changing knock, but we were in the game,” he said.
The match is also fondly remembered as a battle between Pakistan’s stand-in captain Aamer Sohail and Indian pacer Venkatesh Prasad. Pakistan were off to a blazing start as Sohail and Anwar had put on 84 runs for the opening wicket in 10 overs. Despite losing Anwar, Sohail kept the run rate up. He took aim at Prasad after scoring a boundary, and the Indian bowler had the last laugh as he not only dismissed Sohail but also gave him a send-off.
In that match, Pakistan’s then-captain Wasim Akram didn’t play due to a side strain.
When coaxed by anchor Tabish Hashmi about why Wasim didn’t play in that crucial match, Rashid said, “Aap ye Wasim bhai se pooch le (You should ask this to Wasim Akram).”
Anchor Tabish Hashmi immediately replied, “He said he was unfit.”
Rashid Latif then replied, “No comments,” with a smile on his face.

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said Afghanistan’s talismanic all-rounder Rashid Khan is a bigger cricketer than Wasim Akram.
“Rashid has brought Afghanistan on the map, he has helped them get recognition,” Rashid Latif said Hasna Mana Hai, a talk show on Geo News.
“He is greater than Wasim Akram.
“I am sorry to say but Rashid’s stature is bigger,” he said.
The 56-year-old, who has played 37 Tests and 166 ODIs for Pakistan feels Rashid now must improve Afghanistan’s Test team.
“I have only one piece of advice for Rashid Khan. ‘Improve your test team and play more Test matches against Pakistan,'” he said.
Afghanistan will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against South Africa on February 21 in Karachi, followed by matches against England and Australia.
However Afghanistan have suffered an injury blow as off-spinner AM Ghazanfar has been ruled out of both the ICC Champions Trophy and the IPL due to a lower back fracture that will keep him on the sidelines for at least four months, the country’s cricket board announced on Wednesday.
Ghazanfar sustained the injury during Afghanistan’s tour of Zimbabwe late last year, sidelining him for “at least four months”.

Title: Babar Azam’s strength is at No. 3 in the ODIs: Mohammad Amir
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/babar-azams-strength-is-at-no-3-in-the-odis-mohammad-amir-9838529/
Content:
Mohammad Amir has criticised Pakistan team management for promoting Babar Azam as an opener in the ODIs, where his strength is to construct innings at No 3. In the recently-concluded tri-series Babar’s performance as an opener has been underwhelming. The right-handed batter has managed only 10, 23 and 29.
“As I’ve said before, if I don’t get to bowl with the new ball, I can’t fully utilize my strength,” Amir was quoted by A Sports.
“Similarly, Babar’s strength is at No. 3, where he knows how to construct an innings. The role of an opener in ODIs and Tests is completely different from T20s.
“An opener has to adapt in phases. In the first 10 overs, you need to take chances. The next 10 overs are about building a partnership,” he said.
“Babar is a top player, no doubt, but I believe No. 3 is where he belongs. When you’re struggling, you try different things, but sometimes it’s best to stick to what works.”
In the final of the tr-series, Babar Azam became the joint-fastest batter to reach 6,000 ODI runs with Hashim Amla of South Africa, but perished soon after the achievement in his 123rd innings.
Babar looked to shape up well for a big innings and struck cover-driven boundaries until he offered a tame return catch to Nathan Smith on 29. Babar threw down his bat in dismay as Pakistan’s most accomplished white-ball batter totalled 62 runs in three innings.
Mohammad Rizwan has backed Babar Azam to come good with his form.
“Babar has scored so many runs for Pakistan that we expect him to score a hundred in each game,” Rizwan said. “If we don’t judge him by those extreme expectations, you’ll find he’s still chipping in and contributing valuably for us.
Defending champions and hosts Pakistan will start their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 against New Zealand on February 19, followed by the much-awaited clash against arch-rivals India at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on February 23.

Title: WPL controversy: Run outs or not – what does rule say? LED stumps lead to confusion in DC’s win against MI
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-controversy-run-outs-rule-led-stumps-mi-vs-dc-9838173/
Content:
The television umpire for the second Women’s Premier League (WPL) 2025 match had to make some really tight calls on run out appeals from Mumbai Indians, and all three of those went in favour of Delhi Capitals on a dramatic night in Vadodara.
Opting to bowl, DC bundled out MI for 164 in 19.1 overs. In the run-chase, Arundhati Reddy (2 not out) took the two required runs off the final ball to seal the win. But in the moments leading up to that finish, there were controversial moments involving TV Umpire Gayathri Venugopalan, who was called into action for three run out calls.
First, it was Shikha Pandey in the 18th over. Second, it was Radha Yadav in the 19th over. And finally, it was Arundhati Reddy in the last over off the last ball. On all three occasions, multiple replays were asked for by the umpire, who carefully studied the frames, but seemed to interpret that the lighting of the stumps didn’t matter for considering when the stumps were broken.

However, according to rule 4.2 in the official Playing Conditions: “Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.5) the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the
LED lights are illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.” The clause 29.1 referred to here further states: “The wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, one or more stumps is removed from the ground.”

Former New Zealand and RCB coach Mike Hesson posted on X: “Not sure why the umpire tonight has decided that the zinger bails are not applicable? Once bails lights up connection is lost therefore wicket is broken! That is in the playing conditions! Have seen more confusion in last 10 mins than ever before.”

Title: WPL 2025: Matter of frames as Delhi Capitals prevail in dramatic finish against Mumbai Indians

In the end, it was all about the frames. On a dramatic night in the Women’s Premier League, Delhi Capitals beat Mumbai Indians in a thriller that was decided by the smallest of margins, with the TV umpire’s decisions on run-out appeals causing plenty of drama in the closing stages. DC won by 2 wickets off the last ball of the match in Vadodara.
Chasing 165, DC were off to a blazing start thanks to Shafali Verma but MI fought back impressively to have the upper hand in the middle stages. DC’s debutants Niki Prasad and Sarah Bryce played crucial cameos before the lower order held on to win. With 2 runs needed off 1 ball, Arundhati Reddy scampered back for the second run and was deemed to have crossed the line just in time.
Earlier, opting to bowl, DC put up a strong showing with the ball despite MI’s two star batters – Nat Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet Kaur – playing impressive knocks. Shikha Pandey was especially effective with figures of 2/14 as MI were bundled out 164 in 19.1 overs. Harmanpreet rued that they failed to bat out the quota of 20 overs, which proved costly with Sciver-Brunt left stranded on 80.
Shafali, as she tends to do in the WPL, got off to a sensational start but fell for 43 off 18. Niki, India’s U19 World Cup-winning captain, then shone on debut with a patient 35, and was named player of the match. MI, however, would feel aggrieved at three run-out decisions that went against them, with confusion over the umpire’s interpretation of when the LED wickets were broken fairly. The one really costly moment was a decision that went in favor of Radha Yadav, who then smashed a big six next ball to bring the equation down to 10 off the last over.
Earlier, Shafali had accumulated 22 runs in the second over off Saika Ishaque, including four fours and a six, before taking Hayley Matthews to the cleaners with two fours and a six. However, she holed out in the fifth ball. Given a fourth over, Shabnim Ismail cleaned up Meg Lanning, as DC suddenly slipped to 60 for 2. Jemimah Rodrigues (2) and Annabel Sutherland (13) soon followed back to the pavilion, as DC slumped to 76/4 in the ninth over.
For MI, Amelia Kerr (2/21), Hayley Matthews (2/32), Sciver-Brunt (1/38), and Shabnim Ismail (1/18) were the wicket-takers.
Earlier, Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet shared a crucial 73-run partnership off 40 balls for the third wicket, laying a solid foundation. However, DC’s bowlers struck back, taking the final six wickets for 35 runs to dismiss MI in 19.1 overs.
Pandey was the most successful bowler for DC, while Minnu Mani (1/23) was economical. The rest of the bowlers were expensive, but they chipped in with key wickets.
Pandey gave DC an early breakthrough, dismissing both openers — Hayley Matthews (0) and Yastika Bhatia (11) as Mumbai reached 42/2 at the end of the powerplay, thanks to a 19-run over from Alice Capsey (1/25).
Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet took charge, striking 18 runs off Radha Yadav’s eighth over, which included three fours and a six. MI were 87/2 at the halfway mark.
Harmanpreet continued to attack, taking Annabel Sutherland (2/34) for three fours and a six before falling to her in the 14th over.

Sciver-Brunt was left to carry the innings but ran out of partners as MI crumbled.
Brief Scores: Mumbai Indians: 164 all out in 19.1 overs (Sciver-Brunt 80*; Harmanpreet 42, Pandey 2/14) lost to Delhi Capitals 165/8 (Shafali 43, Niki 35, Kerr 2/21) by 2 wickets

Title: What’s the chances of Australia, South Africa, New Zealand in Champions Trophy two years after being semifinalists in ODI World Cup?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-australia-south-africa-new-zealand-chances-9837996/
Content:
A savagely versatile batting consortium makes South Africa a frontrunner to raise the golden cup to the skies, even if their patchy recent form suggests otherwise. From head to the lower limbs, they boast unabashed hitters of the leather ball, who could dismember most bowling attacks in the world.
The headsman of violence is Heinrich Klaassen, mild of manners but a riot of rage with the bat. He enters the tournament with a wounded heart, the near-miss in the T20 World Cup final still haunting him, which makes him a deadlier force. Nothing rattles him, forthright speed or devilish swing or ripping spin, green-tops or turners, making one of the most feared hitters in the game. What makes him elite is the ability to cut the spinners to ribbons in the middle overs. In Asia, he averages 42.29 and maintains a strike rate of 124. He has strummed warning notes with four 80-plus scores in the last four games. Process the strike rates—88, 131, 188, 155. He is one of the most brutal hitters at the death overs too.
If Klaassen is South Africa’s batting general, the trusted lieutenants feature David Miller, an equally ferocious hitter, a rejuvenated Temba Bavuma and a recalibrated Aiden Markram. The young cavalry comprises the buccaneering Tony de Zorzi (strike rate of 95), Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton and Wiaan Mulder. Down the order, Marco Jansen could unlock his long levers to furnish South Africa death-over impetus. Corbin Bosch is relatively unknown, but he is reputed for his big strokes down the order.
Under coach Rob Walter, they have adopted a refreshingly bravado batting approach. Even the hitherto conservative Markram and Bavuma have reeled off progressive knocks, thus making them one of the most entertaining teams of the 2023 World Cup, until India stopped them in the semifinals.
Complementing the hitmen-brigade is a balanced and diverse firm of bowlers. Two left-arm front-line spinners, a wrist spinner and an orthodox counterpart, a bunch of part-time tweakers, a thoroughbred seam artist, a beanpole left-arm seam merchant, a pair of new-age utility bowlers, at least two genuine seam-bowling all-rounders they have covered most bases. But bowlers have been horribly inconsistent, a reason they have lost the last six of their ODIs, including defeats to Ireland. The counterargument is that most of their regular bowlers were injured—Anrich Nortje is still recovering and would miss the tournament—and it’s just the matter of a game to get their act together.
The low-key build-up would suit them, as was the case in the 2023 ODI World Cup and the 2024 T20 instalment. They would rather enter the tournament without any hype and punch above the weight rather than self-immolate as favourites. It would soothe their nerves that the only ICC tournament they have won is the Champions Trophy, even if that was the inaugural edition in 1998. The short nature of the tournament—five wins would seal the deal—suits the team prone to misfortune and moments of madness in the past.
****
The defending world champions Australia are not habitually dependent on the form and fitness of a few luminaries. But this Champions Trophy, the capacity to reclaim the trophy they last hoisted in 2009 will rest on the replacements for some of the big guns missing the edition due to injuries and personal reasons. The ultimate tournament, it’s the event they have bizarrely underwhelmed—damningly they have not won a single game since the victory in the 2009 final.
Five of the eleven that muted the multitude that attended the final in Ahmedabad are absent. The inspirational captain Pat Cummins and line-and-length metronome Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh are injured; Marcus Stoinis has made a shock farewell while Mitchell Starc, the new-ball wrecker, has opted out due to personal reasons. The casualty list has depleted bowling and balance, more than their batting dimension, making the squad the weakest and most unbalanced the serial champions had ever named in a major tournament this century.
Steve Smith would step into Cummins’s shoes—he is as charismatic and perhaps more ingenious. Glenn Maxwell, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Alex Carey, Marnus Labuschagne infuse knowhow, cool and ammo. But the bowling is woefully thin on experience. Some names carry promise, more than dread. Nathan Ellis is a reservoir of variations, has immense IPL experience and familiarity with the subcontinent conditions, but has featured in only nine ODIs. Similarly, Spencer Johnson has the physical traits of Starc, tall and strapping with a bristling action. He could crank up hostile pace, can bend the ball both ways, could extract discomfiting bounce, more than Starc perhaps, but has a fragile body and a thin body of work (3 ODIs and 11 list A games).
The most experienced among the lot is Sean Abbott, but his figures don’t provoke excitement either (33 wickets at 37 in 28 games). Even the most optimistic and patriotic Australian fans would hesitate to gamble on this medium-pace pack to script a tournament triumph. There is definitely a novelty of the unknown, but it looks like a dent too large to fill. The biggest bowling hope, thus, remains the leg-spinner Adam Zampa. His accomplice is leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, who is more of the orthodox kind. But his haul of two wickets in three games, an economy rate nudging seven, inspire less confidence than part-timers Maxwell and Head.
The pair would have to enjoy stellar tournaments, both with bat and ball. if Australia are to go deep into the tournament, leave alone holding the trophy. Explosive batting is their biggest and sole succour in a tournament where they check in as world champions but would not be an outright favourite. Even with their capacity to grit their way through a tournament, this time even a last-four spot would be an overreach.
****
The two titans of seam bowling, Trent Boult and Tim Southee, has farewelled. The brightest young hope, Ben Sears, injured himself a week before the tournament. The batting totem Kane Williamson is ageing, though he presaged his twinkling form with a stylish hundred against South Africa in Lahore. But their USP this tournament is the ensemble cast of part-time spinners, who could lay the foundation of a tournament triumph.
None of Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner and Michael
Bracewell blaze an aura. Except Rachin, a genuinely high-grade batsmen, others are utility men, a stock the Kiwis had seldom felt any shortage, though most of them were of the medium-pace variants. Batsmen wouldn’t bother poring through their video tapes. But they possess an uncanny knack to sting, and offer diverse characteristics.
The understated Santner spearheads them. Also the captain, he has added more layers to his bowling. He is better at controlling his pace, plays around with his release point, manipulates the depth and width of the crease. A shrewd reader of the batsman’s mind, he masterfully sets them up. The economy rate of 4.28 conveys the stifling nature of his bowling. He has emerged a quiet leader of the team, in the absence of Southee and Boult. He handles his spin bunch smartly. Rachin, flatter than Santner, is employed as a partnership breaker, especially against right-handed batsmen. He restricts to burst and does not over-use, as his lack of variations could make him fodder for quality batsmen. With his height, he purchases bounce too—the odd ball suddenly kicks up. He could become a more dangerous bowler when the surface begins to wear as the tournament progresses.
Phillips too has humble gifts, but like Santner is perseverant and can chime in with the odd crucial wicket. He is quicker through the air, hardly gives width for batsmen and possess a skidder that he undercuts that catches batsmen off-guard. Bracewell is a chip off the old block, bowls more conventional off-spin but with immaculate control, as his economy rate of 5.02 denotes. All three could wield the long handle to devastating effect too, providing a coveted balance to the playing eleven. Rachin, of course, is their batting bulwark in Asian climes.
The unusual spin quartet compensates for the lack of X factor in the pace-bowling stream. There are familiar and seasoned names such as Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson, apart from the lanky Will O’Rourke, but the part-time form the real wealth of this side.
The three teams were the semi-finalists of the 2023 ODI world cup, apart from India. South Africa have hitmen-brigade of batsmen and diverse bowlers, New Zealand have a devilish mix of part-timers suited to conditions, but Australia will find it tough to even reach the semi-finals.

If the feeling persisted that the team for the World Cup was slightly over the hill, this batch revels in its utilitarianism. Don’t call them underrated though, because everyone calls them that.

Jasprit Bumrah has been an integral part of the Indian bowling attack in both the 2023 ICC ODI World Cup and the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup though the side did not win the 50-over competition, they did manage to win the 20-over one at the end of which Bumrah was judged Man Of The Tournament. However, going into the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025, the Indian team will miss the services of ace-pacer due to an injury.
However, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia would say India does have enough bench strength. “We have picked the best team for the Champions Trophy. And I believe we will win the trophy. India has such a big bench strength, and I don’t think it (Jasprit Bumrah’s absence) will have any major issue with the team combination,” Saikia said speaking to IANS.
The Indian Express had earlier reported that Bumrah’s availability was anyway unlikely for the group stages of the Champions Trophy and if he indeed played any part in the competition, it would be in the semifinal or final, if India make it. The semi-finals are on March 4 and 5 with the final on March 9.
Bumrah has had back issues earlier and missed nearly 11 months of cricket — from September 2022 to August 2023 — after undergoing surgery. He made a comeback in a T20I against Ireland. The selectors and team management have been careful not to over-burden the leader of their pace attack. During the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs in five Test matches with an average of 13.06 and a strike rate of 28.3, and was often the only bowler to have any impact on the home team.
Bumrah also was the stand-in captain for the first Test in Perth after Rohit Sharma skipped the match for the birth of his second child. He also captained the side for the final Test in Sydney when Rohit decided to sit out because of poor batting form.

Title: Women’s Premier League: Shreyanka Patil ruled out of WPL 2025, as RCB suffer another massive blow

Royal Challengers Bengaluru were dealt another cruel injury blow for their Women’s Premier League season on Saturday as last year’s Purple Cap winner Shreyanka Patil was ruled out of the tournament.  “Heartbroken, but I will fly again,” Shreyanka had posted on social media just before the team’s season-opener in Vadodara on Friday. A day later the league confirmed that she will miss the tournament. RCB, however, have managed to get a strong replacement as they picked the seasoned Sneh Rana who was a surprise non-recruitment during the mini action.
Shreyanka, who has played 15 matches for RCB and has taken19 wickets, with 13 of those coming last year as she finished as the leading wicket-taker. With this news, RCB have now lost the three leading wicket-takers from the 2024 edition. Sophie Molineux and Asha Sobhana (with 12 wickets each) are also out of the third season due to injuries. Apart from their three main bowlers, RCB also lost the services of Sophie Devine in the offseason as the New Zealand superstar decided to take a break from cricket for personal reasons. Kate Cross too pulled out of this year’s tournament. To add to all this, Ellyse Perry confirmed she won’t be bowling for at least the early part of the tournament.
“We have had quite a few injuries post the auction. Some of the players who were in the XI last year are unavailable. Sophie (Devine) is one of the best all-rounders in the world, so we will definitely miss her,” Mandhana said in the captains’ meet organised by Star Sports before the season when asked about Devine’s absence. “It will be tough, but mental well-being is more important than anything. We respect that. Even other injuries… it’s tough. But we have had discussions around that. Playing for them is also something that will keep the team looking forward.”

Rana, who is an all-rounder, has previously played for Gujarat Giants (GG) in the WPL and even led the side when Beth Mooney was out injured. She joins RCB for Rs 30 Lakh.

Title: Despite frontline seam-attack missing, Steven Smith optimistic with options for Champions Trophy 2025: ‘It’s about me communicating with them…’

Content:
Going into the Champions Trophy 2025 Australia will be out of its frontline pace bowling attack in Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood. The side will now have to contend with an inexperienced quarter of seam bowlers in Sean Abbott, Spencer Johnson, Ben Dwarshuis, and Nathan Ellis.
However, skipper Steven Smith is confident that he will be able to get the best out of the attack he has and the key to that is getting them bowling at the right phases of the games.
“They all do it differently, Ben Dwarshius and Spencer Johnson up-top trying to swing the ball back down the line. Sean (Abbott) has terrific lengths, Nathan Ellis has change-ups,” Steven Smith said speaking to the ICC. “I think they’ve all got their own unique skills,” he said. “For me, captaining them, it’s about me communicating with them and trying to get the right option out of them at the right time.”
“Yeah, we’ve got a couple of spinners as well with (Adam) Zampa and Tanveer (Sangha), who’s got a good skill set,” he said. “(In) Maxwell and Short, we’ve got plenty of part-time options.” he added.
Power hitter Jake Fraser-McGurk has been included in the 15-man squad and may replace Marsh at number three in the batting, with Matt Short and Travis Head likely to open. “He’s obviously a very aggressive player. He’s got all the shots around the ground,” Smith said. “It’s just about picking the right time to play them Smith said on McGurk.
Australia Champions Trophy 2025 final squad: Steve Smith (capt), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

Title: ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Aakash Chopra says India ‘have an issue with bowling’ and suggests side to chase in all games

Content:
Indian team going into the Champions Trophy 2025 will miss the services of Jasprit Bumrah. However, the batting of the side looks dynamic and consistent, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra too believes that India should rely more on the batting than bowling to get the results.
“We are saying that we have a lot of variation in bowling and have five spinners as well. However, if we are being honest, we have an issue with bowling. Our strength is our batting. We are playing batting till No. 8,” Aakash Chopra said speaking on his YouTube channel.
“I am with you 100%. It’s the rule in white-ball cricket that whatever is your strength should be the second thing you should do. If your bowling is good, do that later. If your batting is good, do that later, and this team’s batting is good,” he added.
Chopra would suggest India should be chasing in the games as there would also be dew factor which will help their cause. “The pressure to win matches should be on the batters. So definitely India should bat second. If you win the toss, decide to bowl, and you ideally do that as well because dew also comes later at times. If there is any danger of dew, that is always in the second innings,” Chopra would say.
While all the games are scheduled in Pakistan, India’s games are scheduled to be played in Dubai. In the past teams bowling second have had severe issues with the dew factor at this venue.
“So you should have the bat and not the ball in your hand at that time. Whichever way we might see, the answer to that question is India should chase in almost every match. I don’t think there will be a pitch in Dubai where you will need to bat first,” Chopra observed.

Content:
Gujarat Giants will hope their bowlers complement the batters and fielding shows overall improvement after a crushing defeat in the Women’s Premier League season opener, when they take on the UP Warriorz on Sunday.
Gujarat Giants produced a unified batting show to set a commanding 202-run target against the defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru but their bowling frailties were exposed in the first game of the season itself when as many as six options also could not contain the opposition batters.
With only one day to turn their focus on the second match, the Giants will be challenged to regroup and find ways to execute better with the ball and the field. On the other hand, UP Warriorz would take the field under a new captain, India’s Deepti Sharma, after their regular skipper Alyssa Healy opted out of the competition due to a string of injuries.
Deepti has been a vital cog in the Indian teams across formats but the 27-year-old veteran hasn’t held any leadership role with the national side in nearly a decade.

Title: Meet Kerala’s cricket stars, Azharuddeen from Thalangara, Kunnummal from Koyilandy, Baby from Adimali
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/meet-keralas-cricket-stars-azharuddeen-from-thalangara-kunnummal-from-koyilandy-roger-from-vettukad-baby-from-adimali-9837657/
Content:
From distant Kasaragod to capital Thiruvananthapuram – a timeless line the loudspeakers blare during poll campaigns in Kerala, implying the reach of a party or a candidate from the northern tail to the southern tip of the State. From this Monday, fans, friends, and families of cricketers,  along the 577-kilometre-long stretch that curves like a fish, would flock around television sets or hunch over smartphone screens to watch Kerala tussle Gujarat in Ahmedabad for a historic appearance in a Ranji Trophy final.
Last week, a quiet town in southern Kasaragod, once famous for hand-woven prayer caps, was abuzz with festivities when local boy Mohammed Azharuddeen helped Kerala grind out a draw against Jammu and Kashmir in Pune. Some 380 kilometres away, on the banks of Thodupuzha river in Kanjiramattom in Ernakulam district, neighbours thronged medium pacer MD Nidheesh’s house.
The most famous draw in Kerala’s cricket landscape connected hitherto incongruous towns and villages. Man of the match and batting talisman Salman Nizar is from Thalassery, the birthplace of cricket in the state. Akshay Chandran, whose resistance was equally valuable, was born in Kochi, before moving to Kannur and then polishing the game in Thalassery. The captain Sachin Baby is from Adimali in Idukki; Basil Thampi and N Basil are from Perumbavoor, dotted with plywood factories, in Ernakulam district; KM Asif is from Kottayam, Rohan Kunnummal hails from Palakkad, although raised in Kozhikode’s Koyilandy, and Shoun Roger is from Vettukad, in the north-west coast of Thiruvananthapuram.
Except Thiruvananthapuram and Thalassery, none are traditional cricketing nurseries, even though they are all cricket mad and possess facilities of varying ranges. Thalangara, says Azhar’s brother Unais, has about 20-25 clubs that regularly encounter in tournaments. “Thalangara has a good ecosystem for budding cricketers. It’s a small town, but we have around 20 cricket clubs. We are mad about football, but madder about cricket,” he says.
As is Perumbavoor, where Basil Thampi nurtured his cricketing dreams. Says his friend, Jithin George, of the Perumbavoor Cricket Club: “Every weekend, you could watch dozens of leather-ball games. Tennis ball tournaments could be more popular, but there are devoted clubs for leather balls too, playing for the kick of it as well as the hope of turning up for the State or the country.”
The pathway to the state-side starts at the summer coaching camp organised in the vacation months in each of the 14 districts. “Hundreds turn up. We watch each one of them in search of a bright spark. It’s the reason we have players from most parts of Kerala, unlike in the past where most came from Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram or Thalassery,” says  OV Mazhar Moidu, former assistant coach of Kerala as well as the fielding coach of the India A team that toured Australia last year.
To one of the camps, he dragged along an energetic 10-year-old, batting-mad neighbour. He was Salman. “He used to play with his brothers and cousins in his ancestral house, which was close to my house. I took him along and instantly saw the spark. And he backed his gifts with hard work.”
To meet the bus fare to attend the camp in Kochi, the nearest town from his village, Nidheesh accompanied his friends to paint houses in the neighbourhood.
When Sachin started his career — he was named thus by his father the day after his famous namesake Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut in Gujranwala in 1989 — summer camp happened only in the cities. So he was largely self-coached. “Just by observing how they batted in live games or in the highlights, picking a lot of points from commentators too,” he had once told this newspaper.
Even for selection trials, he had to travel 60km to Kochi. The left-handed batsman was picked in the U-13 district squad, but played barely a couple of matches. The scene has changed drastically.
“The best of talents we pick are sent to the elite centres, where they are constantly mentored and monitored. They constantly play tournaments, like the inter-district and zonal ones. Among them, the best ones make the list of probables in the particular age-group, before the same process follows in the next age-group. The filtering system is robust,” says Mazhar.
Even if someone misses out, there are KCA tournaments that give them second chances. “Several players have benefitted from it, like white-ball all-rounder NM Sharafuddeen. The aim is to ensure that no talent goes unnoticed or without the opportunities to show his talents,” he says.
But the selection for Ranji Trophy is more regimented. Explains former cricketer and coach P Balachandran: “We have a core group of 20-30 players. We don’t shuffle the pack, and are reaping the rewards. You can see their bond, they have played a lot of cricket together, and know each other well. One sticks his leg for the other, as you would have noticed during the partnerships. Most of them are in a similar age-group to (late 20s to early 30s)”. For instance, Salman and Azhar, the Pune heroes, had been friends since 2010, when they met at the Elite Academy in Kochi.
Step into the dressing room, the ears would burst with a variety of slangs. Azhar’s Kasargod twang, with its nasal lilts and Tulu-Kannada inflections, could be more Latin for Sachin from the Idukki, where they speak Malayalam with a central Kerala uptalk. It blends different backgrounds too. Azhar’s father was in the Middle East. Salman’s father had worked in the Gulf too; Rogers lived in Sharjah till he was 13, Nidheesh’s father was a clam shell harvester. Sachin’s father was an LIC agent, Akshay Chandran’s an officer in the Navy. Thampi’s family survived on his father’s small chips business, and Rohan’s father is an entrepreneur and mother a bank manager. But everything blurs in their quest for collective glory, which has rippled feverish excitement from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram.

While their batting line-up has worn an inconsistent look, skipper Ajinkya Rahane struck a century and returned to form in the previous round. The team will also be bolstered by the return of Yashasvi Jaiswal after the India opener was dropped from the Champions Trophy squad.
Meanwhile, Vidarbha has been on a roll in the tournament after dominating their group with 40 points. Led by a comprehensive hundred from Karun Nair and a wholesome bowling attack, Vidarbha downed Tamil Nadu to seal a second successive berth in the semi-final last week.
When will the Vidarbha vs Mumbai Ranji Trophy 2024-25 semifinal be played?

Title: Steve Smith on Matthew Kuhnemann’s bowling action being reported: ‘He has been playing for 8 years in professional cricket’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/steve-smith-on-matthew-kuhnemanns-bowling-action-being-reported-9837480/
Content:
Steve Smith said he was “surprised” when he heard the news that left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann’s bowling action was reported “illegal” during Australia’s recently-concluded Test series against Sri Lanka. Australia won the series 2-0 under Smith’s captaincy, who was filling in for injured Pat Cummins.
The left-arm finger spinner took 16 wickets in Australia’s two Tests in Galle, at an average of 17.18.
“It’s come as a bit of a surprise to me,” Smith was quoted by ABC news.
“He has been playing for eight years in professional cricket and nothing has been said in that amount of time.
“I am thinking of him. At present, he has to go through the process.
“We’re confident he will pass. He will go through that process back home. We wish him all the best.”
A bowler is allowed 15 degrees of of extension in their elbow before a bowling delivery is considered illegal.
Kuhnemann will undergo biomechanical testing on his action in the next 10 days, after match officials labelled it suspect during the second Test against Sri Lanka.
“The Australian team was notified of the match officials’ referral following the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will support Matt through the process of clearing this matter,” Cricket Australia had said in a statement on Wednesday.
“Matt has played 124 professional matches since his debut in 2017, including five Test matches and four one-day internationals. He has played 55 Big Bash League games since 2018. This is the first time in those eight years of professional cricket that his action been questioned.
“Cricket Australia will liaise closely with the ICC and independent experts in line with ICC regulations.
“No further comment will be made by Cricket Australia or Matthew until the matter is resolved.”
Kuhnemann is free to play domestic cricket for Tasmania before the test is completed.

Title: Why is struggling Babar Azam opening for Pakistan before Champions Trophy? Head coach Aaqib Javed explains rationale
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/babar-azam-opening-odi-pakistan-champions-trophy-2025-aaqib-javed-9837386/
Content:
Babar Azam looked in pristine touch during the Tri-Series final against New Zealand at the National Stadium in Karachi on Friday before tossing away his start. Batting on 29, Babar offered a regulation caught-and-bowled opportunity to seamer Nathan Smith before Pakistan’s innings progressively collapsed and ended at 242 all out. The hosts suffered a second successive defeat to the Black Caps to concede the Tri-Series title ahead of their Champions Trophy opener at the same venue next week.
Babar, who slotted into the opener’s role alongside Fakhar Zaman in the absence of the injured Saim Ayub, finished the series with 62 runs in three innings. His last ODI century dates back to 21 innings ago in the Asia Cup in 2023 against Nepal. His struggles without an international hundred across formats has extended to over 60 innings.
However, interim Pakistan head coach Aaqib Javed has backed Babar to adapt to his new ODI role ahead of the Champions Trophy. “Our rationale behind the change was that if you look at the away series against South Africa, Babar Azam had to bat in the first over in all games. Then Saim got injured, and he had to open in Tests too. These pitches are not troubling the batters at the start, we wanted our best batter to make good use of the powerplay, that suits us more,” Javed said at the post-match press conference after Pakistan’s five-wicket defeat.
“So, I think, in these conditions, Babar should open and I am hopeful that he will play a big innings in important matches,” he added.
Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali had criticised team’s decision to elevate Babar as an opener.
“If you had won the tri-nation series, then your confidence level would have been high, every boy’s confidence level would have been high,” Ali said on his YouTube channel. “Who is the one who told Babar Azam to open? I am surprised who he is. What crazy people are they? He was performing well at number three, scoring 50-70 against South Africa, but they stopped that too,” Ali lamented.

Title: Rohit Sharma was the burning light of the candle that changed and transformed this ODI team: R Ashwin
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-is-one-of-the-most-selfless-cricketer-r-ashwin-9837399/
Content:
R Ashwin has showered praise on captain Rohit Sharma for transforming India’s approach in the ODIs and called him one of the most “selfless cricketer,” he has ever played with. Under Rohit’s captaincy, India have reached final of the ODI World Cup and won the T2OI World Cup.
“One thing that I admire the most about Rohit Sharma is that he not selfish at all. He is one of the most selfless cricketer,” said on his Hindi YouTube channel, “Ash Ki Baat.”
“If he would have been selfish, he would never have batted the way he is batting in the ODIs. He wouldn’t go after everything in the powerplay.
“So many times he has let go the landmarks to score runs.
“I have massive respect for Rohit Sharma. I am also very happy for Rohit and I’m doubly glad that he is showing that this is the way forward.
“He is like I have scored runs but its business as usual. My one-day form was good. Let’s talk about other players, who has made an impact.  I love that quality of Rohit Sharma.”
Ashwin also credited Rohit Sharma for realising that how game has evolved over the years. In the 2019 ODI World Cup, Rohit played as an accumulator, scored five centuries but in the 2023 ODI World Cup, he become a dasher.
“The thing is that game has changed and evolved. It is important to realise that the game is bigger than all of us,” said Ashwin.
“I was watching an interview of Sachin Tendulkar where he spoke about the runout mishap between him and VVS Laxman. He spoke how his brother taught him an important lesson about the way he responded after getting out. Ajit Tendulkar scolded him for his reaction and told him how he should be a team man.
“It is the same thing here too. Rohit has showed the way for you.
“In India, we have often seen players looking out for their averages, stay not out, look at your scores etc.. to keep an eye on their career records, average and strike rate to cement their place in the teams
“But we forget, why we all start playing cricket? we wanted to wear the jersey and play for India. And Rohit has showed the way forward, and had said that he is putting the team ahead of himself.
“Plus the game has changed too. England changed the ODIs from 2015 to 2019.
“India was actually late to the party. And who showed the way ahead for the Indian team? It was Rohit Sharma. It took us eight years to change our style of play, Maybe if we had changed in six, we might have won one more ICC trophy.
“Rohit was the burning light of the candle that changed and transformed this team,” he said.

Content:
Former India spinner R Ashwin has urged the Indian cricketers to not encourage the “superstar culture” within the team as they are not actors or superstars, but they are just sportspersons.
“It is important to normalise things in Indian cricket. We must not encourage this superstardom and super celebrities within the Indian cricket team,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel, “Ash Ki Baat.”
“We must normalise all these things going forward.
“We are cricketers. We are not actors or superstars.
“We are sportspersons, and we must be someone that the common people should resonate with, and can compare themselves with.
“For example if you are a Rohit Sharma or a Virat Kohli, who have achieved so much. When you hit one more century, it is not just about your achievement anymore. It should be the business as usual, and our goals should be bigger than these achievements,” he added.
R Ashwin has also raised concerns over Indian team management naming five spinners in the form of Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Varun Chakravarthy in the final updated squad for Champion Trophy.
“Five spinners in Dubai? I don’t know. I think we are one spinner too many if not two,” he said.
“The two left-arm spinners are your best all-rounders alongside Hardik Pandya.
“So both Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are going to play. Hardik will also play and Kuldeep will play.
“If you want Varun Chakravarthy in the team, then you will have to make a pacer sit out and use Hardik as your second pacer. Else you will have to drop a spinner to bring in a third seamer,” Ashwin said.

As India prepare for a situation without their seam spearhead Jasprit Bumrah heading into another ICC tournament at the Champions Trophy in Dubai, former England cricketer and coach David Lloyd has urged opposition teams to seize the opportunity and target whoever replaces the India pacer in the XI.
With left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh touted to be a potential replacement for Bumrah in the XI, LLoyd has said the Punjab pacer will have to adapt quickly to the 50-overs format to make a difference. While Arshdeep recently became India’s highest T20I wicket-taker with 99 scalps during the recent series against England, the 26-year-old has only played a handful of ODIs. In nine appearances, Arshdeep has managed 14 wickets at a 23.00 average.
“It’s a great opportunity for someone to come in, someone who wouldn’t make the team. But you can’t get away from the fact that he (Bumrah) is the best bowler in the world, and if he isn’t playing for you, you’ve got a problem” said Lloyd on TalkSport Cricket.
Lloyd said Arshdeep will have to make a huge leap from dominating T20 bowling and adjust the requirements of 50-over cricket.
“Massive difference – four overs to 10. If you’re the opposition, test him out; really get into him,” Lloyd said. “This is not T20 mate, this is not a little party, you’ve got to come back and come back again’, that will be something he won’t be used to,” he added.
Arshdeep was the leading wicket-taker of the domestic Vijay Hazare Trophy with 20 wickets. He also picked up two wickets in his only appearance in the ODI series against England in Ahmedabad. Besides Arshdeep, Mohammad Shami and Harshit Rana are the other specialist pacers in India’s squad.
The Men in Blue open their campaign against Bangladesh on February 19 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Title: R Ashwin slams Ben Duckett for his comments on England’s ODI series loss against India and Ben Stokes’ WTC points system rant

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has criticized England’s approach in the recently concluded white-ball series against India, in which England lost the T20Is 1-4 and the ODIs 0-3.
“To see such a talented England side perform in such a way was disappointing and sad,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel, “Ash Ki Baat.”
Ashwin still feels that England can turn their fortunes around in the Champions Trophy.
“It is not that they don’t have the ability. I am sticking my nek out and will again that this is a top-class England side, but they have taken this ODI series against India very lightly. And England might look a completely different side in Pakistan during the Champions Trophy. If they don’t look a better team, I’d be very disappointed,” he said.
After the loss in the second ODI, England opener Ben Duckett had said he did not care if England endured a series whitewash in India, so long as he and his teammates beat the same opponents in the final of the Champions Trophy.
“If we lose 3-0 to India, I don’t care as long as we beat them in the final in the Champions Trophy. No one will probably look back on this series if we go and do the business in that competition,” he told reporters in Cuttack.
Ashwin slammed Duckett for hiding England’s poor performance behind a joke. Ashwin also recollected Duckett’s comment on Yashasvi Jaiswal during the Test series in 2024, where they were hammered 1-4 by India. After day three of the third Test where Jaiswal slammed his third century, Duckett said: “When you see players from the opposition playing like that, it almost feels like we should take some credit that they’re playing differently than how other people play Test cricket.”
Ashwin said: “No matter what Ben Duckett says but going into the Champions Trophy This series loss will create a big dent to their confidence”
“Ben Duckett has said similar things in the past too, saying Yashasvi Jaiswal has learnt playing aggressive cricket from England’s bazball style. I know Ben Duckett and his penchant for humour.. but this was no joke and it is like you are hiding your failures behind a humour.
“Your 2023 ODI WC were pretty bad as well. It isn’t like they are in a bad form over 2-3 months. It has been the case for four years now. Despite having such a talented group they are not able to justify their potential.”
R Ashwin also slammed England Test captain Ben Stokes, who has recently criticised the points system of the World Test Championship (WTC).
“Even in Test cricket, I read somewhere a few days ago that how Ben Stokes said that he doesn’t understand the points system of the WTC,” he said.
“My only advice to him is that if you don’t understand the points system, then first go and understand it.
“This is not a joke. Every time you lose, you bring up such lame excuses.
“If India have played the way England are playing their cricket now, do you think we would have same captain and coach continue to be at the helm.
“After coming to India, they discuss about the pitch conditions, the kind of food they receive at the hotel…. everything but cricket,” he said.

Title: WPL 2025: Depleted RCB flex batting muscle, with helping hand(s) from Gujarat Giants
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-rcb-batting-muscle-gg-richa-ghosh-ellyse-perry-kanika-ahuja-9836899/

Even before a ball was bowled in the third season of the Women’s Premier League, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) were dealt some major blows as they aimed to defend their title. Leading up to the tournament, they lost the services of Sophie Devine, Sophie Molineux and Asha Sobhana. Shreyanka Patil’s name was absent from the playing XI in the first game and she posted on social media: “Heartbroken, but I will fly again,” casting doubt over whether she can be fit for the season.
Then, Ellyse Perry confirmed pre-match on Friday that she wouldn’t be bowling in the early part of the tournament at least because of a hip issue. That meant, from the 2024 WPL final, RCB lost all of their wicket-takers
But their batting firepower was intact, and it helped them beat Gujarat Giants (GG) by six wickets in Vadodara with nine balls remaining, chasing 202, the record successful run-chase in WPL history.
RCB understandably struggled in the first half against Gujarat Giants, who were powered by a sensational batting effort by their new captain Ash Gardner on their way to the big total. But it was not enough, as the defending champions flexed their batting muscle, with a generous helping hand(s) from GG’s fielders. Perry showed that she is mighty important to RCB even as a pure batter, but the headline act was an unbroken 93-run stand off just 37 balls between Richa Ghosh and Kanika Ahuja.
The chase was massively assisted by the Giants’ poor catching. Perry was dropped on 2, a slightly tough return catch to Tanuja Kanwe, and then on 19 when Harleen Deol dropped a sitter at long-on. The Aussie superstar went on to score a superb 57 off 34 balls to drag RCB back into the chase after early setbacks. Then Simran Shaikh dropped Richa when she wasn’t even off the mark, and it proved to be game-changing as the wicketkeeper-batter plundered 64 off 27 at a strike rate of 237.03. Add to all this, some woeful ground fielding, with overthrows and misfields even from their top overseas players, as the Giants threw away a win that was in their hands.
“Flattening to be honest,” Gardner said. “I knew 200 was only about par halfway, we had to bowl really well. Unfortunately, we dropped some chances which hurt us in the end. Disappointing with the second half but there were some good glimpses. When you do miss those chances, it can hurt you. Richa capitalised on that, rode her luck, but batted beautifully to take them to a win.”
RCB will relish this hard-fought win but their bowling department is going to be tested big time. Between Shreyanka, Molineux and Asha, RCB had the three top wicket-takers of the tournament (a total of 37 wickets between them) last year. That’s the measure of the task facing them. GG went from 53/2 after 9 overs to 201/5, scoring 108 runs in the last 11 overs. Mandhana said the bowling would have to step up going forward, but the fight she saw from her depleted side would give her confidence.

Gardner said before the season that forgetting what happened in the last two seasons would be a good start for GG as they look to climb out of the bottom of the table. Despite shining in a personal capacity, she just might have to add the opening match of the third season to the list of things to forget.

Title: New Zealand beat Pakistan to win tri-nation title
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/new-zealand-beat-pakistan-to-win-tri-nation-title-9836832/
Content:
New Zealand clinched the tri-nation title by beating hosts Pakistan by five wickets in the final in Karachi on Friday to give them a major boost ahead of next week’s Champions Trophy.
Seamer Will O’Rourke (4-43) led New Zealand’s tidy bowling as they bundled out the hosts for 242 with three deliveries still left in their innings.
Daryl Mitchell (57) and Tom Latham (56) struck fifties as New Zealand romped home with 28 balls to spare, finishing unbeaten in the tournament that also involved South Africa.
Electing to bat, Pakistan kept losing wickets every time a partnership promised to bloom.
Skipper Mohammad Rizwan (46) and Salman Agha (45) forged an 88-run partnership for the fourth wicket but boundaries were not easy to come by.
Tayyab Tahir (38) and Faheem Ashraf (22) contributed useful runs down the order but Pakistan lost their last five wickets for 47 runs to settle for a below-par total.
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner conceded 20 runs in his 10 tidy overs, claiming two wickets.
Pakistan fast bowler Naseem Shah removed opener Will Young in the second over but New Zealand’s frontline batters, aided by Pakistan’s sloppy catching and woeful use of the review option, produced useful cameos to keep their chase on track.
Pakistan dragged themselves back into the contest after removing Devon Conway (48) and Kane Williamson (34) but could not drive home their advantage.
They wasted a review in their desperation to get Williamson lbw and did not use the option when Latham was given not out despite being trapped plumb in front.
Latham got two more reprieves as Shaheen Afridi spilled a return catch while Saud Shakeel floored a sitter at square leg.
Abrar Ahmed held on to a return catch to remove Mitchell but Latham punished Pakistan for their sloppiness and went on to complete his fifty.

Latham’s luck finally ran out when Abrar took a catch in the deep – spraining his neck in the process — but it came too late for the hosts as New Zealand were on the cusp of victory.

Title: Pitch report: Will India’s spin-heavy tactic backfire? How important is the sun, shadow and dew in Dubai?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dubai-champions-trophy-pitch-report-weather-india-spin-tactic-9836675/
Content:
The shadow of the gigantic concrete structure, slower in the day, slight dew in the night, bit of live grass and largely batting-friendly conditions…these are the key elements India have to factor in during their stay at Dubai where they will play all their Champions Trophy fixtures, which begins on February 19.
Only a week to go for India’s opening match against Bangladesh, one question lingers. Has India taken a gamble by including five spinners and just three seamers for the Dubai trip. The question is not bereft of logic. Hosts Pakistan, who could possibly play two matches including the group fixture against India on February 23, and are more familiar with the conditions in the Emirates, have just named one specialist spinner. There, thus, hangs a sweaty intrigue.
The three venues in UAE – Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi – although slow, offer varied conditions in their own way. Among them, the Dubai International Cricket Stadium has been the most unique one thanks to its huge concrete structure. “It’s a closed environment, so when it comes to Dubai a lot depends on which pitch you are playing,” former India player Robin Singh, who is familiar with the conditions thanks to his stint as the national coach of the UAE in the past, tells The Indian Express.
“So, in Dubai, you have a centre wicket and then you have wickets to the side. So, the sun actually hits the wickets till about 3 to 4 o’clock in the evening. After that, it forms a shadow. So, the wickets to the left generally, it tends to be a little slower because you don’t get enough sunlight for long periods. The way the stadium is built, the sunlight is only there for a period of time. Of course, it will be warm because of the humidity and it will always bring dew into play. But dew is pretty early for that, so it’s not going to come down to toss,” adds Robin, who recently coached MI Emirates that featured in the ILT20, which concluded last Sunday.
His state-mate Hemang Badani, who was the head coach of Dubai Capitals that won the ILT20 title, says how they had to change plans in the second half of the season. “We stared with four seamers and two spinners, but towards the end we had to bring in an extra spinner as it got slower. Since it is still early part for the dew to set in, there was help for the spinners,” Badani weighs in.
In the seven ODIs that have been played in the month of February at the venue, only two have involved full members Pakistan and England. Both times, the chasing team emerged winners. But the sample size is skewed because the game happened back in 2012. When it comes to March and full member nations, both the matches were won by teams batting first. Out of the 58 matches the ground has hosted, only 22 have been won by teams batting first.
With Bumrah not around, and Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana far different from Mohammed Shami in terms of their lengths, it would be interesting to see how India goes about defending totals. If dew shows up, playing two wrist spinners (Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy) will be risk-fraught. If they chose to go with one, it would leave them short on attacking options, which India have preferred largely in recent times in ODIs.
With the stadium not having cross-ventilation, it also denies the seamers the opportunity to move the ball for long periods like they do at Abu Dhabi, which has large open fields, and Sharjah, where there are no huge structures. It means, the new ball could offer some help under lights, but unlikely to provide prolonged assistance for the seamers. “In the night, it has always shown a tendency to skid on. The dew is not extensive now, but it helps batting in the night. There will be runs for the taking. But if you’re a good fast bowler, at night, you can exploit those conditions. A good seam bowler, someone like Shami will be a good bet in Dubai because he hits those right lengths and areas. Anyone who can hit the seam well and hit those areas will be reasonably successful,” Robin adds.
This perhaps explains the reason why pacers have been more effective in Dubai than spinners. In the 58 ODIs played in Dubai, pacers have accounted for 463 wickets at an average of 28.62 at an economy of 4.78. The spinners have 320 scalps to show at an average of 30.17 at a slightly lower economy of 4.25.
With the matches starting at 2.30 PM local time, thanks to the dryness, it has usually been the best time to bowl if teams can overcome their aversion of fielding first under the afternoon sun. It is learnt that the curators have ensured that few of the pitches were not used in the second half of the ILT20 so that it remains fresh for the ICC event. “I think they have kept aside a few wickets that they would want to play on. Of course, they have to leave a fair amount of grass so that the wickets won’t turn or disintegrate. So, I think there will be good wickets to bat on. But definitely batting second is an advantage in Dubai. If you’re playing in the daytime and it goes into the night, it tends to be a little slower in the daytime,” Robin adds.
It explains why the venue has seen 300 being touched only on four occasions, with only one coming in the second. Being on the slower side doesn’t necessarily mean spinners would get more turn off the pitch. It has seldom turned square nor has the pitch crumbled because of the heat like we see in sub-continental conditions. “In the daytime, you will see the spinners get a lot of help from the surface. So it comes down to the depth of your batting and the strength of your bowling. The ball tends to travel a bit in Dubai. So if you don’t have a good attack in your hand, then your batting has to step up, which is why the batting depth is necessary. Three hundred will be a big enough total here,” Robin says.

That explains why India brought in Varun Chakaravarthy in place of a batsman. They seem to have evaluated all these factors and sans Bumrah they know they have to shore up their batting. If that’s the case, two of Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar are bound to fit into the XI with a toss up between Kuldeep and Varun for the third slot.

Title: Indian investors won’t affect Pakistan players’ involvement in Hundred: ECB chief
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-investors-pakistan-players-the-hundred-ecb-9836614/
Content:
The participation of Pakistani cricketers in the Hundred will be unaffected despite half of the teams in the franchise cricket tournament based in England expecting Indian investment from owners of IPL teams, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive Richard Gould has confirmed.
Each of the eight teams of the Hundred have entered exclusivity agreements with new private investors for a stake in the franchises, which includes RPSG Group (Lucknow Super Giants), Sun TV Network Limited (Sunrisers Hyderabad), Reliance Industries Limited (Mumbai Indians) and GMR Group (Delhi Capitals). But the new investment will not change the geographical composition of the playing groups.
“We’re aware of that (Pakistani players being snubbed in franchise leagues) in other regions,” Gould was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo. “But that won’t be happening here.”
In the SA20 league in South Africa, for instance, where IPL franchise owners own each of the six teams, there are no Pakistan players in any squad.
Gould also confirmed that it is unlikely for Indian players to feature in the Hundred, as has been the case with the BCCI not allowing Indian players to play franchise leagues abroad.
“In terms of availability to Indian players, that is not priced in with our plans. The BCCI’s position has been very clear. At some point we’d love to see Indian players come and play in England,” the ECB chief said. “We currently see them obviously in bilaterals and actually quite a lot in county cricket. But that’s not something that we have predetermined through this process.”

Gould believes that new Indian investment will aid them in finding an audience in the country. “The fact that we have got such a wide-ranging set of investors from around the globe will, I believe, help us to add extra value to our overseas broadcast rights,” he said.

Title: ‘Good prep for Champions Trophy’ – South Africa coach unbothered by six-match losing streak
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/south-africa-coach-six-match-losing-streak-champions-trophy-9836585/
Content:
As finalists of last year’s T20 World Cup, with a team full of big names on the franchise-league circuit, South Africa may give the impression of being a formidable white-ball team. But their current form going into the Champions Trophy in Pakistan next week does not.
Two successive defeats to Pakistan and New Zealand in the ongoing tri-series – both matches in which they failed to defend 300+ scores – and a whitewash by Pakistan in the ODI series at home late last year puts the Proteas on a six-match losing streak going into their Champions Trophy opener against Afghanistan on February 21.
But coach Rob Walter is not as concerned. “We have more information now than we did before, for Lahore and Karachi,” he said in a press conference after defeat to Pakistan on Wednesday, according to Cricbuzz. “To have a good understanding of conditions is a win, and something we’ll lean on as we move forward. For those in the squad who are going to be in the Champions Trophy, it’s good prep. And there’s plenty of learning for the younger guys who’ve not been to Pakistan before.”
The calm response may be perplexing after such a horrid run, but it stands to reason. White-ball bilateral cricket today is hardly an indicator of a side’s form or fortunes, with most of their players missing from playing XIs as either rested or playing franchise cricket in a different corner of the world.
And South Africa is no different. The tri-series acted only as a glorified warmup for them with as many seven of their main playing XI – Ryan Rickelton, Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, Tristan Stubbs, David Miller, Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada – missing.

So, Walter was content enough to get information on the Pakistani conditions in their two concerning losses. “If the pitches are the same [for the Champions Trophy] you can expect to see more scores of 350. There wasn’t much seam movement, there wasn’t much bounce, and there certainly wasn’t much turn. So only eight wickets fell,” he said.

Title: PAK vs NZ Tri Series final: Babar Azam becomes joint-fastest player to score 6000 ODI runs

Pakistan’s Babar Azam became the joint fastest player to get to 6000 ODI runs in the Tri-Series final match against New Zealand. The former Pakistan captain shares the top spot with South Africa’s Hashim Amla with both players needing 123 innings to complete the milestone.
Babar reached the landmark after he smashed a boundary off Jacob Duffy in the 3rd ball of the 7th over before going on to make 29 runs. He was then dismissed by Nathan Smith who caught a follow through off Babar’s willow in the 12th over.
Pakistan would ultimately post 242 runs with the help of captain Mohammad Rizwan’s 46 and Salman Agha’s 45 with William ORourke taking 4 wickets for the Kiwis.

Earlier, Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat against New Zealand in a dress rehearsal for both teams ahead of next week’s opening game of the Champions Trophy.
Pakistan eliminated South Africa from the final with its epic run-chase of 355-4 at the same venue on Wednesday with captain Mohammad Rizwan and vice-captain Salman Ali Agha scoring centuries.
Pakistan brought in fast bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf for his first ODI since his last appearance against Sri Lanka at the Asia Cup in 2023.

Ashraf replaced fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain, who went wicketless in his eight overs for 72 runs during Pakistan’s highest ever successful run-chase in ODIs two days ago.
“The pitch looks a little dry, and we want to put runs on the board,” Rizwan said at the coin toss.“The ODI win in the last game was massive and it has given us the momentum.”
New Zealand, which beat both Pakistan and South Africa at Lahore last week, made two changes and brought in Nathan Smith and Jacob Duffy. Smith replaced fast bowler Matt Henry while Duffy came in place of Ben Sears, who has been ruled out of the Champions Trophy with a hamstring injury.

“The boys have played here a lot and we had two trainings on similar wickets,” New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner said. “In Pakistan, the wickets are good. You always want to win, but there’s a bigger picture.”

Title: Australia vs Sri Lanka | ‘The system has failed and let him down..’: Former Australian spinner O’Keefe backs Matt Kuhnemann over reported action
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-vs-sri-lanka-matt-kuhnemann-action-okeefe-9836534/
Content:
With Australian left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann being reported for a suspect action post Australia’s 2-0 win in the two-Test series in Sri Lanka, the Queensland cricketer finds himself among a list of bowlers having to undergo independent testing for his action and being out of international cricket till his action is not cleared. 28-year-old Kuhnemann was the leading wicket-taker with a total of 16 wickets for Australia in the two Test series in Sri Lanka and former Australian cricketer Steve O’Keefe has accused Cricket Australia and Queensland Cricket of failing to identify the left-arm spinner at an early age.
“He’s played over 100 professional games of cricket in front of match referees in the Big Bash and first-class cricket. He would have trained in front of coaches who would have seen his development over the years. I think it might be hyperextension, and I don’t think he’ll have any issues. In this situation, it can be quite detrimental to the player and the welfare of Matt after a great series in Sri Lanka, he now has to go through this process which is horrible. It’s really cold, you’re on your own, they don’t talk to you, they tape you up and then they test you with these degrees of action. In my opinion, the system has failed and let him down, but I do believe there will be nothing to see here for Matt Kuhnemann … I think he’ll be okay.” O’Keefe told Fox Cricket.
Kuhnemann had made his List A debut in 2017 and played for Australia for the first time in 2022, when he made his ODI debut in Sri Lanka. Since then, the Australian has also made his Test debut against India in 2023 and has played in five Test matches and four ODIs in his career. Kuhnemann will now undergo independent testing at an ICC-Accredited centre likely to be in Brisbane as reported by Australian media. Queensland coach and Big Bash team Brisbane Heat coach Johan Botha, who himself was reported for a suspect bowling action multiple times during his playing career, believes it will be a long process for Kuhnemann.
“It is a long process and unfortunately either way if you get cleared or not it will always be there. “Guys think it’s a one-off and you get rid of it. That is not how it is. It is a bit of a process. For now he will have to bowl at a very similar speed and revolutions as he did in the Tests. Nothing gets changed now. He needs to try and prove himself not guilty and from there on if it is a ball or so over 15 degrees he will obviously have some work to do, then a long process starts. It never goes away because there is always someone in the crowd, someone in the opposition, or a match referee who wants to have a say or wants to feel a part of it.” Botha told SEN Cricket.
According to reports, some Sri Lanka batsmen had raised their concerns over Kuhnemann action prior to the second Test too. It was only after the second test that match officials reported Kuhnemann’s action. Former Australian spinner Xavier Doherty has raised questions over the timing of the reporting of the spinner’s action.

“He’s been to India which is a massive tour with huge media interest. He’s been cleared there. He’s come to Sri Lanka, he’s taken a lot of wickets … which generally goes with the territory of people criticising or calling out your action. The timing is the big question mark for me. What have these guys [the match officials] seen now that we have to have a look at?,” Doherty told ABC Sport.

Title: ‘India was nothing we had not seen’: 2017 Champions Trophy winning Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed recalls title victory
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sarfaraz-ahmed-2017-champions-trophy-india-vs-pakistan-9836491/
Content:
With the Champions Trophy starting next week, hosts Pakistan will be looking back at their 2017 Champions Trophy triumph as an inspiration to win the ICC tournament once again and win the trophy as defending champions. In 2017, the Sarfaraz Ahmed led Pakistan team had scored a ten-wicket win over arch rivals India in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval to score their third win over India in the tournament’s history and Ahmed has recalled the final win as ‘indescribable’.
“We played England in the semi-finals and our bowlers were just superb. Then, it was India in the final. I was just confident our level was very high and my message to the players ahead of the final was to relax. We knew we had beaten some of the best teams, so India was nothing we had not seen. The rest is history. When the last wicket went down and we won, it is impossible to describe that feeling in words. When I took the last catch, I was at gully. And I just ran. I saw Shoaib Malik and ran into his arms, I jumped into him and hugged him. The whole team then joined in. It was indescribable,” Ahmed told the ICC website.
The Mohammad Rizwan led Pakistan side will open their campaign in Champions Trophy with their opening match against New Zealand at National Stadium in Karachi. In the 2017 Champions Trophy, Pakistan had suffered a 124-run loss against India in their opening match at Birmingham. It was a match, which saw Pakistan bowling attack consisting of Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Wahab Riaz struggle against Indian top order followed by their batting unit failure. Ahmed recalled how senior players Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez motivated the team. “Afterwards, we had a great team meeting, and some of our senior guys – Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Hafeez – all said their piece. You need those types of characters around you. We changed our mindset from that day. The acrimony was very good for us, we made a couple of changes to the team and it helped our confidence,” Ahmed said further.
Pakistan have recalled opener Fakhar Zaman in the final squad for Champions Trophy. Zaman had scored a hundred in the final against India at the Oval and has made a return to the Pakistan ODI in recent weeks. Ahmed urged the Pakistan team to stay calm while playing against India in Dubai February 23.

“Whenever we meet, it is a special occasion and there is so much hype and pressure around it. But as players, you need to stay calm, try and block that noise out, and just play with the same intensity as you would play Australia or any other team. Pakistan has a really good chance of defending that title and I think they have a strong team. Some of the boys from 2017 are still there and we’re talking about some of the best – especially Babar Azam. He is a different Babar to the one that played in 2017, a more mature player and a dominant player in the game. His batting will be so important for Pakistan and so will Fakhar Zaman’s batting. With the ball, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf are brilliant bowlers and are playing well. The captain, Mohammad Rizwan, is also a wicketkeeper-batter, which worked pretty well for me back in 2017!” said Ahmed.

Title: Champions Trophy | ‘What I don’t understand is the number of spinners…’: R Ashwin raises questions over India’s tactics
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-r-ashwin-india-spinners-tactics-9836448/
Content:
With the Indian team management naming five spinners in the form of Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Varun Chakravarthy in the final updated squad for Champion Trophy, former Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised questions for Indian taking so many spinners to Dubai. While India had named Yashasvi Jaiswal in the provisional squad, the Mumbai batsman was excluded from the final squad with Chakravarthy making his way into the final squad.
“What I don’t understand is the number of spinners we are taking to Dubai. Five spinners and we have made Yashasvi Jaiswal sit out. Yeah I understand that we take three or four spinners for a tour. But five spinners in Dubai? I don’t know. I think we are one spinner too many if not two. The two left-arm spinners are your best all-rounders alongside Hardik Pandya. So both Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja are going to play. Hardik will also play and Kuldeep will play. If you want Varun Chakravarthy in the team, then you will have to make a pacer sit out and use Hardik as your second pacer. Else you will have to drop a spinner to bring in a third seamer,” Ashwin said on his Youtube channel Ash ki Baat.
While Chakravarthy made his debut during India’s second ODI against England last week, the leg-spinner had picked up a total of 14 wickets in the five match T20I series against England earlier. Ashwin though expects Chakravarthy to form a good pair with Kuldeep but finds the number of spinners being taken to Dubai as ‘uncomfortable’. “I don’t think there is any doubt that Kuldeep Yadav will walk into the team. So how will you make space for Varun. Is he bowling well? Of course. Either you bring in Varun and Kuldeep as a duo, which I feel would be good. But my question is, in Dubai, are you expecting the ball to turn? In the recently held ILTO, we saw that the ball was not turning that much in Dubai and teams were chasing 180-run totals with ease. I feel a bit uncomfortable with the team,” added Ashwin.
The former cricketer found Yashasvi  Jaiwal’s exclusion a bit unfortunate. Jaiswal, who too made his ODI debut in the first ODI of the three-match series against England, was later dropped to make way for Virat Kohli in the second ODI and did not play further in the series.

“I am honestly glad that I am not in a position of explaining things to Yashasvi Jaiswal. If I was the coach or captain then what will I even tell him? I raise this question many times that what are you messaging to a player? Yashasvi was bringing water for the players. I was thinking what would be going on in his mind? He would have been happy that he would be in the Champions Trophy team. And now suddenly he is not in the team. It’s the same for anybody who misses out,” said Ashwin.

Title: Is getting whitewashed ‘the new black’ in cricket run-ups? Australia, South Africa, England all drubbed before Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-run-up-whitewash-australia-south-africa-england-9836350/
Content:
If Jofra Archer caught napping on camera during England’s batting had seemed very odd and metaphorical during their 0-3 series loss to India, South Africa, losing 5 ODIs on a trot in the leadup is downright strange as the big teams head into Champions Trophy in coming days.
Steve Smith’s Australia wrapped up their Sri Lanka sojourn, losing both their 50-over fixtures, to complete 3/4ths of Group B of the Champions Trophy heading into that tournament whitewashed, and wallopped.
It could be interpreted either as teams holding back their cards and not offering rival video analysts data on a platter. Or plain abysmal form in the run-up.
But the Saffers first. Between unearthing the Breetzke blitzkrieg of their newest batting sensation, the Proteas have now lost 5 ODIs going back two months. They could barely defend 239/9 against Pakistan at Paarl, losing by 3 wickets. And later faltered in chases by 81 runs at Newlands and 36 in a DLS revised chase at Wanderers, giving Pakistan a 3-0 away win.
In the tri-series, the Proteas have twice failed to defend 300+ scores, first Kane Williamson helping Kiwis track down 304-6 in 49th over and then Pakistan overhauling 352/5 with an over to spare.
This makes the usually highly-rated ODI side going into the CT with one of the poorest win forms.
England are giving the impression of being in a slumber too, starting out their 3-match series against India with a 4 wicket loss after failing to cross 250 at Nagpur, then making 304 and being swamped by Rohit Sharma. And finally allowing India’s middle order to bolster themselves with confidence ceding 356 and falling 142 runs short.
England lost to West Indies 1-2 in the previous series, their last win coming on November 2, 2024.
Australia, who are headed to Pakistan, without Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, never got going against Sri Lanka, losing by 49 and 174 runs respectively, as their batsmen failed to cross 41 in individual scores and a strike rate of 107 in two matches. They also picked up the notorious record of their lowest ever ODI score of 107 on Friday.
Australia also lost 1-2 to Pakistan in November, and their last win was on November 8th.
Afghanistan, the 4th team in Group B, however beat Bangladesh 2-1 in a series against Bangladesh at UAE. They last played an ODI series in Zimbabwe and won 2 out of 2 completed by 232 runs and 8 wickets respectively.

In these times of bumper to bumper cricket, leadup series are hardly an indication. But those three big names will land in Pakistan without an ODI win this 2025.

Title: ‘They play for 10 months a year’: Kapil Dev expresses concerns on rising injuries to India players
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kapil-dev-concerns-indian-player-injuries-10-months-9836249/
Content:
Former India captain Kapil Dev said that the demanding cricketing schedule was behind the rising number of injuries among Indian players. The latest star player to be hit with the injury bug is Jasprit Bumrah who was ruled out of India’s Champions Trophy squad, sending the Men in Blue’s plans in disarray.
“The only thing that worries me is that they play for 10 months a year — injuries will be much more common,” Dev said.
Mohammed Shami, India’s top wicket-taker in the 2023 ODI World Cup (24 wickets), suffered a leg injury post-final and underwent surgery. His 14-month recovery ruled him out of the BGT series, which India lost for the first time in a decade. Shami’s absence left Bumrah without a reliable bowling partner.
When asked about how Bumrah’s injury can impact India’s Champions Trophy preparations, the 1983 World Cup winning captain said that the focus should be on the players who have made it to the squad.
“Why talk about someone who is not in the team? It’s a team game, and the team has to win, not individuals. This is not badminton, tennis, or golf; we are playing a team sport in the Champions Trophy. If we play as a team, we will definitely win,” said the 66-year-old.
“You never want your main players to get injured, but if it happens, you can’t do anything about it. Good luck to my Indian team — go and play well,” he added.
He also wished luck to the young players as they embark on the quest to win the Champions Trophy with India playing against Bangladesh in their first match on February 20 in Dubai.

“When you see the youngsters, their confidence is unbelievable. We didn’t have this much confidence when we were young. Good luck to them,” Dev said.

Title: Australia suffer biggest ODI defeat against Sri Lanka, lose series 2-0 ahead of Champions Trophy 2025
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-biggest-odi-loss-174-runs-sri-lanka-champions-trophy-2025-9836129/
Content:
Hosts Sri Lanka dampened Australia’s preparations as they recorded a thumping 174-run victory in the second ODI to seal the series 2-0 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday.
With their Champions Trophy preparations already staggered by the absence of their star pacers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and all-rounders Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis (retired), the series defeat serves as a huge blow to the ODI World Cup world champions.
After opting to bat first, Charith Asalanka’s men put on a hefty 281/5 on the board on the back of wicket-keeper Kusal Mendis’ stroke-filled century. Captain Asalanka and Janith Liyanage then provided a strong finish with their 35-ball 66-run partnership for the fifth wicket. While Asalanka remained unbeaten on 78 off 66 balls, Liyanage struck 32 in 21 balls.
Seed alert!
And it's triggered a massive collapse for Australia #SLvAUS pic.twitter.com/96vgyshEiS
— cricket.com.au (@cricketcomau) February 14, 2025
Australia’s reply was damaged early with Sri Lanka pacer Asith Fernando removing openers Travis Head, Matt Short and No. 3 Jake Fraser-McGurk within the first seven overs. Spinners Wanindu Hasaranga (3/23) and Dunith Wellalage (4/35) then razed down the middle-order with captain Steve Smith top-scoring at 29.
The -run defeat marked the Aussies’ biggest ODI defeat by runs against Sri Lanka, eclipsing an 82-run loss at the same venue in 2016.
The defeat marked the second successive ODI bilateral series that Australia have lost against the Lankans, with their last triumph dating back to their tour to the country in 2016. The teams last met in an ODI series in Australia in 2012/13 when the five-match series finished 2-2.
Australia will now travel to Lahore where they will meet England in their Champions Trophy opener on February 22. Afghanistan and South Africa are the other teams in the same group.

Title: Brendon McCullum hits out at Ravi Shastri and Kevin Pietersen, dismisses ‘factually incorrect’ claims
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/brendon-mccullum-hits-out-at-ravi-shastri-and-kevin-pietersen-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-9836090/
Content:
England coach Brendon McCullum has dismissed the claims that they didn’t train adequately in the recently-concluded ODI series against India.
After the first ODI in Nagpur, England did not train in the second and third match against India.
Former India coach Ravi Shastri and England captain Kevin Pietersen has slammed Jos Buttler-led for skipping training ahead of the second and third ODIs.
“Firstly, it’s factually incorrect, the whole statement that we don’t train,” McCullum told ‘talkSPORT.’
“We’ve trained plenty right throughout, and guys have come from a lot of cricket as well. I think it’s an easy thing to have as a throwaway line that guys don’t train enough when the results aren’t right.”
McCullum also pointed out the injury setbacks to Jacob Bethell (hamstring) and Jamie Smith (calf).
“We’ve got a style and a method that we believe in. We’ve got guys who are battling injuries and trying to make sure that we’ve got enough bodies out on the field, knowing that we’ve got a huge assignment coming up in a week or two.
“Ultimately it’s factually incorrect what’s been said and we’ll stay true to what we believe in,” he said.
England suffered a 142-run defeat to India in their final ODI before the Champions Trophy slated in Pakistan and Dubai next week. The ODI series loss came after a 1-4 drubbing by India in the T20I rubber
“Ultimately, you’re judged on results… From our point of view, we’ve got to strip away the fear of failure that results can bring,” he said.
England will be in UAE for a short break before beginning their Champions Trophy campaign against Australia in Lahore on February 22.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025: Is India’s death overs acceleration their relative ODI weakness?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-odi-death-overs-batting-weakness-champions-trophy-2025-9835975/
Content:
India’s three-match ODI series against England could not have finished much better than a 3-0 whitewash this week.
“I don’t see there was anything wrong with what we did in this series. There are certain things we are looking at (to improve),” said captain Rohit Sharma after the third ODI in Ahmedabad, where his team got what it wished for being put into bat. Batting first for the first time in the series, India racked up a sizable 356 in Ahmedabad.
As they capped off a hefty 142-run victory, a slight problem patch may have reared its head for this incredibly star-studded batting pool during the slog overs at the Narendra Modi Stadium.
With their Powerplay intent booming to unprecedented rates since 2023 on the back of Rohit’s blitzkriegs and adept accumulation becoming the forte of Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer in the middle-overs, the death-overs (41-50) remains an integral phase for the innings construction fruition.
Since the last World Cup year in 2023, India’s middle-overs (11-40) average (42.67) is the best among all teams. The strike rate (90.70) in this phase – though healthy – aren’t as rapid as three other teams that will compete in the upcoming Champions Trophy. This comes after swashbuckling starts in the Powerplay, where India go over a 100+ strike rate – the only team after world champions Australia (107.33) to clock the feat. However, the big hits are somewhat inconsistent at the end where India fail to ace the power game like South Africa or Australia.
Of the top eight teams at the Champions Trophy, the Proteas are way clear of the rest in the pyrotechnics at the death, with big bats Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller muscling the strike rates to a whopping 143.99. India (122.76) slot in fifth, following Australia, England and Pakistan in the finishing act.
The latent runs between the transmission from middle-overs aggregation to the death-overs aggression is something India would be wary of in the hunt for 50-overs ICC recognition.
In the Ahmedabad ODI where they had a go at full 50 overs with the bat for the only time in the series, India went from 275 for four to 356 all out in the final 10, with No. 5 KL Rahul and Hardik Pandya starting the phase. The team collected nine boundaries within the 81 runs and lost six wickets in 10 overs.
While India present a gutsy Hardik and the versatile Rahul in the lower-middle order, the duo has yet to seal the finishing imprint over the last few years. Consequently, the team has relied on one of their top 3 to wade deep through the final 60 balls of the innings to leave an impact. Also, the sore thumb from insufficient boundaries is exaggerated on days like November 19, 2023, when all tactics and templates are tested together, leaving the side to rebuild and attack simultaneously in a World Cup final. Constricted by the Aussies, India added 43 runs with two boundaries between overs 41-50 in Ahmedabad that day, losing five wickets.
Since 2023, No. 3 Virat Kohli tops the charts for most runs in the death overs for India, having amassed 271 runs in seven of the 30 innings the team has played in the phase. Kohli has also lasted more deliveries (168) than his teammates, with his 161.30 strike rate coming in third behind Klaasen (214.34) and Miller (171.36) among batters with at least 200 runs at the death in this period.
The lack of consistently quick boundary-hitting separates India’s death-overs bats in Rahul, Hardik and Ravindra Jadeja from leaving the same levels of destruction on the old ball. For context, the Klaasen-Miller combine has totalled 37 per cent of all death-overs batting runs for South Africa since 2023, turbocharging at 189.47 SR and blasting a boundary every 3.87 deliveries.
India will similarly hope to pick up the miles in Dubai and thereafter. Among the eight teams in the Champions Trophy, India’s balls per boundary at the death (7.16) is the fifth-slowest since 2023, with only Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and New Zealand falling behind.
For the collective firepower mustered by captain Rohit at the top, the middle order has a catch-up job awaiting to keep the ‘intent’ salvo burning blue at all times.

Title: New Zealand fast bowler Ben Sears to miss Champions Trophy 2025
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/new-zealand-fast-bowler-ben-sears-to-miss-champions-trophy-2025-9835849/
Content:
New Zealand has suffered a major setback ahead of the Champions Trophy as fast bowler Ben Sears has been ruled out with a hamstring injury, the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said in a statement.
“Sears felt some pain in his left hamstring at the team’s first training in Karachi on Wednesday and a subsequent scan revealed a minor tear that would require at least two weeks’ rehabilitation,” NZC said in a statement.
“The rehabilitation timeframe means that Sears would likely be available for only the team’s final Group A match against India in Dubai, and so the decision was made to rule him out.”
Sears will be replaced by Jacob Duffy, who is already with the team as part of the squad for the ODI Tri-Series against Pakistan and South Africa. New Zealand will take on Pakistan in the final of the tri-series on Friday at National Stadium in Karachi.
“We’re all really feeling for Ben,” said New Zealand head coach Gary Stead.
“It’s always tough being ruled out of a major event at such a late stage, and it’s especially tough in Ben’s case given it would have been his first major ICC event.
“The timeframes for Ben to be fit to play again meant he would likely miss the majority of the group stage, and given the short nature of the tournament, we felt it was appropriate to bring in a player who is fully fit and ready to go.
“Ben is a player with huge potential and given the short rehabilitation timeframe, we’re sure he’ll be fit and raring to go for the home series against Pakistan back in New Zealand.
Stead said Duffy was a strong replacement in the squad.
“Jacob showed with his performances in the recent home series against Sri Lanka that he is more than capable at international level.
“He’s been part of the squad for the ODI Tri-Series so he’s fully acclimatised and he’s got plenty of experience in these conditions and is fit and ready to go.
“He’s another player who will be experiencing his first senior ICC event, so it will be an exciting few weeks ahead for him.”
New Zealand will start their Champions Trophy campaign against hosts Pakistan on Wednesday.

Title: New Delhi Capitals coach Hemang Badani bats for more Indians at the helm of IPL teams
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/hemang-badani-interview-delhi-capitals-coach-indians-ipl-teams-9834803/
Content:
There is more than a month to go for the Indian Premier League, but there’s already a lot going on in Hemang Badani’s mind. And not without reason.
This IPL, he will take over as head coach of Delhi Capitals, who are seeking their first title. After a seven-year stint with Ricky Ponting, they have turned to Badani. Just like Kolkata Knight Riders did three years ago by turning to Chandrakant Pandit and what Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings have done in the past – have an Indian in charge off the field.
Having won three successive titles in the Lanka Premier League and ILT20 on Sunday with Dubai Capitals – a sister franchise of Delhi Capitals – and having been part of Sunrisers Eastern Cape SA20 title-winning set-up as batting coach, Badani is a decorated globe-trotting coach. After spending three seasons as Sunrisers Hyderabad’s batting coach, this is the first time he would be in the hot seat at an IPL franchise.
“Out of 25 players in the IPL, 16 are Indian players and it is these players who play a big role in your success. They come from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Given the tournament is so short, one would rather prefer a local coach who understands and connects with these players better, but we haven’t seen enough Indian coaches at all,” Badani argues.
Since the inception of the IPL, franchises have mostly preferred big-name overseas coaches. In the 17 IPL seasons till date, 15 titles have been won by sides with a foreigner as head coach. In the last three years though, two of the three titles have been won by teams that had Indian coaches. “When you have only foreign coaches, invariably one of them is going to win it. I’m not against teams having foreign coaches, but don’t rule us out. Only if we compete with them will you know whether it is possible to win the title. Ashish (Nehra) won in 2022 when he was the lone Indian coach around. Last year, (Chandrakant) Pandit showed he can do it as well,” says Badani, who also won four titles in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), his maiden coaching stint.
To drive home his point, Badani points out that the Big Bash League, SA20 and the Caribbean Premier League have a heavy presence of local head coaches, as it provides them cutting edge in terms of knowledge about local players. “When you have a local head coach, he knows the conditions and the local players better. It is why they end up on the winning side rather than those teams that have overseas coaches often. In IPL, most franchises have experienced overseas players, and they are ultra-professional, so it is all about managing them. With Indian players, you have to give a lot more focus because of the various barriers. This is where an Indian coach will be better,” Badani adds.
In that sense, come the IPL, the pressure and expectations would be a lot more on Badani despite the success he has enjoyed across leagues. So far in his coaching career, he has tasted success in each of the leagues he has coached in, and believes there is no need to change what he has been doing. “I look at every tournament as an opportunity to express myself. I’m objective, do my preparations and prefer staying in the present. I’m assuming there will be pressure and expectations. How am I going to survive or how am I going to enhance myself? I’m very diligent and will just go back to my own style of coaching, my own style of preparation. If I’m prepared well, it gives me a good chance to do well.”
With Delhi Capitals, he tends to stick to the template which has worked for him with his previous teams. “It doesn’t necessarily guarantee success. I’ve to first win the trust of the players and make them buy into the story. There is no coach who would say there is a set pattern. My role is to empower the player by giving him as much information and from there on, they take the field. And in a tournament like IPL, you have to be realistic… you have to be prepared to lose some games. If you have a success rate of 60-70 percent, it is enough to win the trophy,” Badani adds.

This has been a journey that has in many ways surprised himself. Having finished his first-class career in 2013, Badani, like many of his peers, went into broadcasting before a TNPL gig came his way. “As a player, I felt that I didn’t have the right temperament to handle 15-20 players. I mostly kept to myself and wasn’t a people-to-people person. But when I did TNPL, I enjoyed being back on the field. Contrary to what I thought about myself, I’d it in me to be a coach,” he says.

Title: Women’s Premier League: Can Indian cricket find its next superstar? Will Shafali Verma make a statement? WPL season preview
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-third-edition-domestic-india-cricketers-superstars-9834781/
Content:
From one city in its inaugural edition, the Women’s Premier League will spread its wings a little further for the third season, being held in four different venues across the country, starting with Vadodara on Friday. Gujarat Giants will play hosts to Royal Challengers Bengaluru as the first leg kicks off at the BCA Stadium. After six matches, the caravan will shift to the home of the defending champions in Bengaluru. Lucknow will then take centerstage where UP Warriorz will get a chance to play in their home venue for the first time, then the curtains will come down in Mumbai.
Indian cricket, meanwhile, would love to see the spread of WPL across the length and breadth of the country reflected in the performances on the field too. There is little doubt that the first two editions have helped female domestic cricketers achieve financial security while also providing a bigger platform to showcase their skills. The likes of Saika Ishaque, Asha Sobhana, Sajana Sajeevan and Shreyanka Patil have gone on to play for India, thanks to their performances in the tournament. But, now into the third season, the league could do with producing an Indian superstar for the present and the future.
Even between the first two seasons, the graph headed in the right direction. The first season was largely dominated by the overseas stars – and the most familiar Indian names – when it came to match-winning performances, with the top three wicket-takers and run-getters all being foreign players. In the second season, Shreyanka and Asha bucked the trend in the Purple Cap race while Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana crossed the 300-run barrier among batters. The ideal evolution for the league would be for someone from the domestic setup to break into these lists more frequently.
5️⃣ Captains, 1️⃣ Dream 🏆
The teams are ready to go for another exhilarating #TATAWPL season! 🥳

— Women’s Premier League (WPL) (@wplt20) February 13, 2025
The trickle-down effect of the WPL is not lost on India captain Harmanpreet Kaur. “One noticeable improvement in domestic cricket has been the strike rates of batters,” the Mumbai Indians skipper said on Thursday in a media briefing held by Star Sports. “This season, we saw multiple 300+ run scores in domestic matches. Players know they have to work on their power-hitting abilities and that we have seen. That’s the biggest positive from WPL. Even fielding, and overall skill development is happening which is very good. Domestic cricketers have prepared themselves thoroughly for this opportunity.”
Meg Lanning, who has won it all in international cricket with Australia but faced back-to-back final heartbreaks in the WPL, is back for another go with the Delhi Capitals. “The WPL has had a huge impact not just on international players but also on the local players here in growing the game. I have really enjoyed watching their development and evolution as a player. They have been getting better with the kind of opportunity that WPL provides them,” Lanning told DC.
Lanning’s sheer presence in the franchise has been appreciated by quite a few Indian players, not least Shafali. The swashbuckling opener, after a really impressive WPL season, has seen her form dip which led to her exclusion from India’s white-ball squads. She piled up runs in the domestic season after that, clearly showing she’s too good for that level but WPL is the platform where she can catapult herself back into India reckoning.
While DC are arguably the strongest side on paper, having improved even the couple of chinks they had in the previous seasons, 2024 winners RCB have had some serious setbacks before the tournament begins. From the playing XI of last year’s final alone, they have lost three key players: Sophie Devine, Sophie Molineux, and Asha Sobhana. There are injury concerns around Ellyse Perry and Shreyanka as well. A lot will depend on Mandhana’s form with the bat, and some new domestic talent to come through, if RCB are to defend their title.
“We have had quite a few injuries post the auction. Some of the players who were in the XI last year are unavailable. Sophie (Devine) is one of the best all-rounders in the world, so we will definitely miss her,” Mandhana said in the captains’ meet. “It will be tough, but mental well-being is more important than anything. We respect that. Even other injuries… it’s tough. But we have had discussions around that. Playing for them is also something that will keep the team looking forward.”
While three out of the five usual suspects have returned to lead their sides, UPW and GG have turned to new captains. The Warriorz have handed the responsibility to Deepti Sharma, who came into her own last year as an allrounder, walking away with the Player of the Tournament award. In Alyssa Healy’s absence, this will be a big test for her. “I have been a leader in domestic cricket so that will help. It’s going to be a challenging role, but I like challenges,” Deepti said.
Giants, who have been bottom of the table for two years in a row, have rung in the changes. The legendary Mithali Raj is no longer part of the backroom staff and Ashleigh Gardner has been named captain. After a public fallout with Deandra Dottin before the first season, they have brought back the ‘World Boss’ who will hope to show the league what it’s been missing.
“Forgetting what’s happened in the last two years is probably a good start,” Garnder said. “We can’t change what happened in the past. The squad for this season has lots of experience but also some fantastic young players coming through. That just shows through someone like a Priya Mishra, who has made her debut for India and to see her progression in such a short span at the international stage… she’s just one example of what the league has done.”

And producing more Shreyanka Patils and Priya Mishras will define WPL’s success going forward.

Title: How Shreyas Iyer is trying to be the Yuvraj Singh-Suresh Raina hybrid in middle overs
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shreyas-iyer-yuvraj-singh-suresh-raina-hybrid-middle-overs-9834724/
Content:
The outside chatter does not rankle Shreyas Iyer. It simply irritates him, like perhaps flies buzzing around him. “It’s irritating, especially when it comes from people who haven’t faced 150 km per hour delivery advising you to play in a particular way,” he quipped during an Idea Exchange with this masthead.
It’s the suffocating reality of sportsmen in the era of social media snap judgment. The flaws are cruelly exposed, exaggerated and ridiculed; a verbal slip is ruthlessly scavenged and spun out of context, deities are designed and demolished in the flutter of merciless fingers, and in the clutter of games, match-defining acts arrive with shorter shelf lives.
So it’s the fate of Shreyas to be crucified for one flaw of his rather than be celebrated for his virtues. The short-ball, quick and skiddy, searing into his rib-cage troubles him. He is getting around it—he has experimented and adopted different stances, trigger movement and bat-swings. But fast bowlers would instinctively look to bounce him out.
However, for all his short-ball travails, he remains a valuable but undervalued batsman of his team. He straddles a set of roles that are so unique that it’s hard to define his role, and harder to dislodge him from the playing side.
He is neither the opener nor finisher—the two most glamorous roles in this format. He does not occupy the spot reserved for the team talisman, the No 3 role. Nor that of the stabiliser the crisis. His role is akin to defensive midfielder in football, to fill holes, to cover-up his erring teammates, an agent of cohesion, the man who furnishes others the licence to be themselves, to let others shine in his light.
Iyer’s relentless aggression unburdens Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill and KL Rahul; he lets them bat at their comfortable pace. He enables Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel to conserve their destructive energies to the death overs. He fuses the qualities of the top-order, the short-making repertoire, game-reading and awareness, with the daring of the lower-order. He infuses assurance, albeit a frenetic one, yet ensures that the run-rate builds.
The three knocks in the series against England are instructive exhibits of rare and supreme craft. In Nagpur, he strode out at No 4, with India wading a semi-crisis at 19 for 2, and blasted 59 off 36 balls, providing the impetus for the chase. In Cuttack, he scored 44 off 57 balls, enacting a more watchful role after a blistering start. In Ahmedabad, his freewheeling 78 off 64 balls turbocharged India to 356. So was it in the 2023 World Cup, where he reeled off every genre of knock, and where he truly was one of India’s batting pillars. Only Kohli and Rohit scored more runs than him, but he scored his 530 runs at a quicker clip than Kohli (113 to 90.31), and unlike Rohit didn’t have the allowance of fewer fielders inside the ring. Iyer’s task was to wreak havoc in the middle-overs.
Maybe, that is his role—the middle-over disruptor, the all-calculated counterpuncher, unpredictable in his mood, methods and manners. A Suresh Raina-Yuvraj Singh hybrid.
But like most things in life, you are more valued by adversaries rather than friends and family. The Australian think-tank spent most of their analysis-time plotting ways to contain him before the World Cup final. If it were as simple as bouncing him out, the well-worn pace attack wouldn’t have wasted so much time and energy on him. The short-full ball double-bluff worked in the end, but any top batter could be vulnerable to smart scheming.
Like his role, he bats differently to other batsmen. With all others, there is a pattern. Rohit, in his hyper-aggressive avatar, goes hammer and tongs from the start. Gill and Kohli soak their time before shifting through the gears; KL Rahul is an artful destroyer. Iyer is patternless, like a clever sniper. He might block the first five balls, or swipe the first ball onto the sight-screen. At times, he fidgets in the crease, stands differently, or moves differently. The bat descends from different angles.
All these could misconstrue an impression that he is unsettled. On the contrary, this is his cricketing wisdom ticking. He once explained to this newspaper: “On a certain track, you need to chop and change a little bit with your stance. Not your grip that much, but with your stance and your trigger movements. I have practised a lot on that. I have a set mindset, like, okay, this is how I’m going to play on that particular wicket. If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work. But I went out there with a plan. You might not execute it every time.”
He ferries the ball to unusual areas too. For instance, he tickled a pacy Mark Wood from the off-stump past the wicket-keeper, when most batsmen would have tried to run it down the third man. With a swirl of the wrists, he lofts the ball over mid-off’s head whereas others would have looked to bunt it through covers. Besides, he is India’s most destructive player of spin bowling. Former coach Rahul Dravid dwells on another valuable trait of his. His temperament. “I think one of the things Shreyas has shown us right from the time that I have seen him [play for] India A, is his temperament, the way he handles success and failure. You just look at even some of his knocks under pressure, how he’s able to actually bring the best out of himself under those pressure situations,” he elaborated.

He is selfless in a way that centuries or man-of-the-match plaques don’t seduce him, letting others shine in his light. The numbers too glitter—801 runs at 53.40 with a strike rate of 114.59. Yet, he remains grossly understated. Yet, his place in the eleven is questioned. Yet, he would have sat out of the Nagpur ODI had Kohli been fit. Yet, there is incessant chatter about his short-ball flaw. But, he is gradually building a legacy—the legacy of the Iyer role, the middle-over disruptor.

Title: Yashasvi Jaiswal added to Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad for semifinal vs Vidarbha
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/yashasvi-jaiswal-mumbai-ranji-trophy-team-vidarbha-semifinal-9834650/
Content:
After missing out of the Champions Trophy squad, Yashasvi Jaiswal was on Thursday drafted into the Mumbai Ranji Trophy squad ahead of their semifinal clash with Vidarbha on February 17. Mumbai outclassed Haryana by 152 runs in their quarterfinal match at Kolkata on Tuesday.
Jaiswal had previously played for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy this season but could muster only 4 and 26 as his team went to down to Jammu and Kashmir in a shocker of a result. Things didn’t get better for Jaiswal in the Indian setup with the youngster then joining India for the 3-match ODI series against England where despite making his debut in the format in Nagpur, he could just score 15. After that, he had to sit out the next two ODIs as India went on to win the series 3-0.
Jaiswal, who was in the preliminary squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy, was on Tuesday moved to the list of non-travelling substitutes alongside Shivam Dube and Mohammed Siraj, meaning they will travel to Dubai for India’s matches only if necessary.
The explosive left-handed opener had impressed in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy with 391 runs in five Tests at an average of 43.44, including one century and two half-centuries.
The upcoming last-four stage clash between Mumbai and Vidarbha will be a rerun of the Ranji final between the two teams last season, in which the former won to lift their 42nd title in the premier domestic tournament.
The team was picked by the senior selection committee of Mumbai Cricket Association consisting of chairman Sanjay Patil, Ravi Thaker, Jeetendra Thackeray, Kiran Powar and Vikrant Yeligeti.

Mumbai squad: Ajinkya Rahane (Captain), Ayush Mhatre, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Amogh Bhatkal, Suryakumar Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Siddhesh Lad, Shivam Dube, Akash Anand (WK), Hardik Tamore (WK), Suryansh Shedge, Shardul Thakur, Shams Mulani, Tanush Kotian, Mohit Avasthi, Sylvester Dsouza, Royston Dias, Atharva Ankolekar, Harsh Tanna.

Ahead of their Women’s Premier League opener against Gujarat Giants on Friday, Royal Challengers Bengaluru announced that allrounder Asha Sobhana has been ruled out of the tournament due to a knee injury. The franchise announced that wicketkeeper-batter Nuzhat Parween will be Sobhana’s replacement this season.
“Unfortunately, our champion all-rounder, Asha Sobhana, has been ruled out of #WPL2025 due to a knee injury! Star wicketkeeper-batter Nuzhat Parween will replace her for the season!,” the franchise posted on X.
Asha had sustained the injury at a T20 World Cup against Australia in Sharjah just after the toss and had to be replaced. This is the latest injury blow to RCB with the defending champions also losing Sophie Molineux, who pulled out after a knee injury.

Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians have picked Parunika Sisodia as a replacement for an injured all-rounder Pooja Vastrakar for the Women’s Premier League, the franchise said on Thursday.
The WPL starts on Friday with a match between defending champions RCB and Gujarat Giants in Vadodara.
Parween, the wicketkeeper from Railways has represented India in 5 T20Is and will join RCB for her base price of Rs 30 lakh. Vastrakar was ruled out of the third edition of the WPL due to an injury.
Parunika, who was picked by the Gujarat Giants in the inaugural edition of the league, will now feature in the Mumbai Indians squad for WPL 2025.

The left-arm spinner pitched in with crucial breakthroughs during the recently concluded ICC Women’s U19 T20 World Cup and was adjudged the Player of the Match in the semi-final against England. She joins MI for Rs 10 lakh.

Title: Three Pakistan players fined for breaching code of conduct in Tri Series match vs South Africa
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-players-fine-code-of-conduct-breach-south-africa-odi-9834292/
Content:
Three Pakistan players were fined by the ICC on Thursday for breaching the code of conduct in separate incidents in their ODI win over South Africa in the ongoing Tri-Series. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Saud Shakeel and Kamran Ghulam were all fined for their actions against South Africa players in Karachi on Wednesday.
Shaheen was fined 25% of his match fee when he deliberately got in the way of South African batter Matthew Breetzke while he ran a single as the two players squared up and the umpire stepped in to defuse the situation.
In the next over, a mix-up led to Temba Bavuma being run out and Pakistan’s Shakeel and Ghulam celebrated too close to the batter, who briefly stopped his walk back to the pavilion until they were out of the way.
Three Pakistan players receive fines for breaching ICC Code of Conduct in #PAKvSA.https://t.co/oINQsN7Qvd
— ICC (@ICC) February 13, 2025
Both Shakeel and Ghulam were fined 10% of their match fee for breaching the code over “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his/her dismissal.”
Since all three players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by match referee David Boon, no formal hearings were held.
On Wednesday, Pakistan defeated South Africa by 6 wickets, completing their highest successful run chase in ODIs when Salman Agha and captain Mohammad Rizwan both struck centuries to help the hosts reach 352.
South Africa, without several first team regulars, batted first on a flat wicket and with a lightning quick outfield, and amassed 352 for five in their 50 overs on the back of half-centuries from captain Temba Bavuma (82), Matthew Breetzke (83) and Heinrich Klaasen (87).

Pakistan will next take on New Zealand in the final match of the Tri Series in Karachi on Friday.

Title: ‘Virat doesn’t need a captaincy title to lead,’: RCB team director Mo Bobat
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-does-not-need-captaincy-title-mo-bobat-rcb-9834202/
Content:
After Royal Challengers Bengaluru announced Rajat Patidar as their new captain on Thursday, team director Mo Bobat said Virat Kohli has a natural penchant for leadership which will benefit the new skipper, adding that the former skipper does not need a ‘captaincy title’.
“Virat was an option (for captaincy). I know that the fans would have probably leaned towards Virat in the first instance. But my point on Virat would be that Virat doesn’t need a captaincy title to lead. Leadership, as we’ve all seen, is one of his strongest instincts. I think it just comes naturally to him. He leads regardless. But we’ve seen a lot of love for Rajat too,” Bobat said in a media interaction.
“He (Virat) leads, as an example. The volume of runs and the strike rate that he scored last year was so important for us. Everyone in the field knows that they’ve got to be up to their standards because of him. Everyone’s seen how much he likes a fight and a scrap,” he said.
“He’s an example. (Head coach) Andy (Flower) and I lean on him quite a lot. (Former captain) Faf (Du Plessis) had leaned on him quite a lot. We’re pretty sure that Rajat will also be leaning on him too,” he added.
After the announcement of Patidar’s captaincy was made on Thursday morning, RCB also posted a video on its social media handles where the former RCB captain, Kohli, had a special message for Patidar.

“I am here to inform everyone, like the others will do as well, that Rajat Patidar is going to be the new captain of RCB. Rajat, firstly I want to congratulate and wish you all the very best. The way you have grown in the franchise and the way you have performed, you have really made a place in the hearts of all the fans of RCB, all over India. They get excited to watch you play. So, this is very well deserved. Myself and the other team members will be right behind you and you’ll have all our support,” Kohli said in a video posted by RCB.

Title: IPL 2025: Rajasthan Royals appoint Sairaj Bahutule as spin bowling coach
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-2025-rajasthan-royals-appoint-sairaj-bahutule-as-spin-bowling-coach-9834100/
Content:
Rajasthan Royals have appointed former India all-rounder Sairaj Bahutule as their spin bowling coach ahead of the IPL 2025 season on Thursday.
The 52-year-old Bahutule returns to the Royals having been a part of the setup from 2018-21. A stalwart in Indian domestic cricket, Bahutule has an impressive record of over 630 wickets and 6,000 runs in first-class cricket. Bahutule played for India in two Tests and eight ODIs and has since transitioned into a successful coaching career. He has mentored teams such as Mumbai, Bengal, Kerala and the Indian naional men’s team.
Bahutule will work under RR head coach Rahul Dravid. The franchise also recently roped in Vikram Rathour as the batting coach for the season.
“Sairaj’s deep understanding of spin bowling and his extensive coaching experience make him an invaluable addition to our team. His proven ability to mentor young bowlers aligns perfectly with our vision at Rajasthan Royals. Having worked with him before, I am confident that his insights and guidance will significantly benefit our players as we strive for excellence in the upcoming season,” Dravid said on Bahutule’s appointment.
“Joining Rajasthan Royals again is a tremendous honor. The franchise’s commitment to nurturing talent and playing an exciting brand of cricket resonates with my own coaching philosophy. I am eager to work alongside Rahul and the rest of the coaching staff to develop our bowling attack and contribute to the team’s success. Together, we aim to achieve great milestones in the forthcoming season,” Bahutule added.

Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Virat Kohli has sent a special message for Rajat Patidar, who was named as the new captain of RCB. Patidar will take over the reins of RCB from Faf du Plessis. RCB were expected to name a new captain ahead of the 2025 season of the Indian Premier League since the South African was not retained by the franchise. After the announcement was made on Thursday morning, RCB also posted a video on its social media handles where the former RCB captain, Kohli, had a special message for Patidar.
“I am here to inform everyone, like the others will do as well, that Rajat Patidar is going to be the new captain of RCB. Rajat, firstly I want to congratulate and wish you all the very best. The way you have grown in the franchise and the way you have performed, you have really made a place in the hearts of all the fans of RCB, all over India. They get excited to watch you play. So, this is very well deserved. Myself and the other team members will be right behind you and you’ll have all our support,” Kohli said in a video posted by RCB.
“To grow into this role, of course it is a big responsibility and I have done this for many years. Faf (du Plessis)’s done it for the last few years. To be seen as the guy who will take this franchise forward, I am sure this is a great honour for you. I am very very happy for you. You’ve earned the right to be in this position and I am sure you will grow from strength to strength. I have seen Rajat evolve as a player in the last couple of years as a player, got the chance to play for India. His game has improved many levels in the last couple of years. The way he has led his state team as well and the responsibility he has taken, you’ve shown everyone what it takes to lead this amazing franchise,” he added.
“I just wish him all the very best and I would request all the fans to support him, get absolutely behind him. We know that he will do what best for the team, what’s best for the franchise and we must all get together to support him because, regardless of what happens, who does what, the most important thing is the team and franchise. We all have that responsibility to work towards the growth of this amazing team and franchise. Sending my best wishes to him, and sending all the fans lots of love. Looking forward to seeing you and looking forward to have Rajat start off the season with a bang.”

Title: Record Indian fans travelled to Australia for Border-Gavaskar Trophy

The recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy was attended by a record number of Indian fans, Cricket Australia has announced.
The India versus Australia series saw a six-fold increase on ticket sales from people living in India from the previous Border-Gavaskar Trophy hosted by Australia in 2018/19. Cricket Australia said that over 6,000 travelling fans bought tickets from India. This was in addition to those who purchased tickets through friends and family in Australia.
A total of 8,37,879 people attended the series, the fourth most for any Test series in Australia and the highest for any non-Ashes series. Nearly 5 per cent of all ticket purchasing fans travelled for the matches from overseas, CA said. In addition to attendance records being set at venues across the country, at least eight sessions averaged over two million viewers with 40 sessions averaging more than 1 million viewers.
India topped the list of international ticket sales for this Australian cricket summer, surpassing the UK and USA. The Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was a huge hit among Indian fans, with over two-thirds of tickets sold to Indian travellers for this Test alone.
“We are delighted that Australia has become a pre-eminent destination for Indian cricket fans fuelled by the enormous interest in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. The passion of Indian supporters helped enhance the electric atmosphere at every ground across the summer. We’re committed to deepening our relationship with cricket fans all over the world and enhancing the fan experience for both local and travelling fans alike. The increasing number of travelling Indian fans this summer highlights Australian cricket’s increasingly important role in facilitating tourism and trade outcomes for governments and businesses across Australia,” said Joel Morrison, Cricket Australia’s Executive General Manager Events and Operations.
Indian cricket teams will return to Australia next summer, with the men’s team featuring in a three ODIs and five T20Is in October-November 2025, and the women’s team in a seven match multi-format series in February-March 2026.

Title: ‘We don’t look at averages, stats and all that stuff’: Gautam Gambhir on Axar Patel’s elevation
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/we-dont-look-average-stats-gautam-gambhir-axar-patel-elevation-9833592/
Content:
After India defeated England 3-0 in the ODI series, coach Gautam Gambhir explained his rationale for promoting Axar Patel up the batting order over KL Rahul in the first two ODIs.
“That’s the way cricket is meant to be played,” Gambhir explained when asked about Axar’s promotion in the batting order. “I know a lot of people talk about it, but that’s the way we got to play the game, and that’s the way cricket should be played. It’s not about the batting order, it’s about who can create what impact. If you have the option of putting a quality left-hand batter in the middle, why won’t you do that?” Gambhir asked.
“Why would you want to have top five as right-handers? We don’t look at averages and stats and all that stuff. We look at who can deliver more at that number. And Axar has done fabulously well. Both the games [in which] he got the opportunity, he delivered for us. I know there will always be talk – there will always be people talking about it – but I think that’s the way we want to go in future as well.”
Axar scored 52 runs off 47 balls at No 5 in Nagpur and 41 not out in Cuttack.
Gambhir’s fondness for the left-right combination also led to the Indian team picking Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first ODI at the cost of Shreyas Iyer. Iyer did play that game as a replacement for Virat Kohli, who had an injury on his knee.
Despite his preference for right-left combination, Gambhir also said that KL Rahul would be the preferred choice for wicketkeeper rather than Rishabh Pant in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, which will start next week.
“At the moment, KL is a No.1 wicketkeeper for us, and he’s delivered for us,” Gambhir told reporters after the game.

Title: RCB Captain for IPL 2025: Rajat Patidar named RCB captain for IPL 2025

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have named India and Madhya Pradesh batter Rajat Patidar as the captain of the franchise for the IPL 2025 season on Thursday.
Patidar takes over from Faf du Plessis who led the side across three seasons between 2022-24 where the team made it to the IPL Playoffs twice. The 31-year-old Indore-born batter made a dramatic re-entry into the IPL mid-way through the 2022 season as a replacement player for Luvnith Sisodia in RCB after having previously played four games in 2021 for the franchise but not retained later that year.
In eight games in 2022, Patidar aggregated 333 runs including an unbeaten 112 off 54 balls in the IPL Eliminator win against Lucknow Super Giants. Patidar later missed the 2023 season due to an Achilles Heel injury but was retained by the franchise for another season. In 2024, Patidar was at his destructive best for RCB, smashing 33 sixes while amassing 395 runs in 15 matches.
The next captain of RCB is…
Many greats of the game have carved a rich captaincy heritage for RCB, and it’s now time for this focused, fearless and fierce competitor to lead us to glory! This calmness under pressure and ability to take on challenges, as he’s shown us in the… pic.twitter.com/rPY2AdG1p5
— Royal Challengers Bengaluru (@RCBTweets) February 13, 2025
Ahead of the IPL 2025 Mega Auction in November 2024, Patidar was retained for Rs 11 crore alongside former skipper Virat Kohli (Rs 21 crore) and Yash Dayal (Rs 5 crore).
Patidar is the eighth captain for RCB since the IPL’s inception in 2008, following Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Kevin Pietersen, Daniel Vettori, Kohli, Shane Watson and du Plessis.
Patidar recently Madhya Pradesh to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2024-25 final, losing to eventual champions Mumbai. Smashing 27 maximums, Patidar racked up 428 runs in nine outings with five fifties. Patidar’s only ODI and three Test appearances came between December 2023 and February 2024.
Overall, Patidar has aggregated 2463 runs in 75 T20s with a 38.48 average and a whopping 158.18 strike rate.

Title: WATCH: Jofra Archer caught napping mid-match in dugout in Ahmedabad, Ravi Shastri takes a dig at England’s trip

Content:
Former India head coach Ravi Shastri took a dig at England and seamer Jofra Archer after he was spotted taking a nap in the dugout during the third ODI against India at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.
While England were tottering in a massive 357-run chase after opting to field first, the England quick was revealed to be napping in a corner of the English dugout by the television cameras.
Shastri, who alongside Kevin Pietersen, were lambasting England for not attending training sessions in Cuttack and Ahmedabad seized the moment to nail in their criticism.
“From what I’ve heard, England have had just one net session this entire trip, if not any. If you’re not prepared to do the hard yards, you’re not going to improve,” said Shastri.

Meanwhile, Pietersen added that Tom Banton who flew in as cover for the injured Jacob Bethell in the third ODI was seen practising golf instead of a training hit ahead of the third match. “The 2-hour flight from Dubai across here. He (Tom Banton) was on the golf course yesterday. He wasn’t batting, and where have the issues come? The start, 1 for 60, 2 for 80. And then, what happens? None of them can play spin. And how do you improve playing spin?,” said Pietersen.
The cameras soon panned out to a napping Archer when Shastri swung for a sixer. “Precisely the question which I said. Nice time for a nap. It’s that kind of a trip for England,” the former India head coach remarked.

Title: ‘KL Rahul is our No. 1 ODI wicketkeeper, Rishabh Pant has to wait’: India head coach Gautam Gambhir
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gautam-gambhir-india-wicketkeeper-kl-rahul-rishabh-pant-9833437/
Content:
Weighing in on India’s wicket-keeper debate in the ODI format, head coach Gautam Gambhir has backed KL Rahul to continue in the role ahead of Rishabh Pant for the Champions Trophy.
Rahul, who presided over the wicket-keeping gloves in the three ODIs against England, made a substantial outing with the bat in the third game in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, scoring 40 off 29 balls batting at No. 5. India posted a hefty 356 in 50 overs before thumping England by 142 runs to seal a 3-0 whitewash win.
“At the moment, KL is a No.1 wicketkeeper for us, and he’s delivered for us,” Gambhir told reporters after the game. “And see, when you’ve got two wicketkeepers in this squad, you can’t play both the wicketkeepers with the kind of quality we’ve got. Hopefully, whenever he (Pant) gets that opportunity, he should be ready for it. That’s all I can say at the moment. Right now, KL is the one who’s going to start,” added Gambhir.
In Pant’s absence due to his horrific car accident in December 2022, Rahul filled in as the wicket-keeper in the ODI World Cup year in 2023. The 32-year-old aggregated 1060 runs in 24 innings with two centuries and seven fifties. Rahul opened India’s World Cup campaign in Chennai against Australia with a match-saving 98 not out before aggregating a total of 452 runs in 10 innings.
Meanwhile, Pant last featured in a ODI against Sri Lanka during a three-match series in August 2024 where Rahul kept wickets in the first two games. Pant fell stumped for six in that Colombo outing and has featured in 31 matches

Title: ‘Absolutely gobsmacked’: Kevin Pietersen slams England for not attending practice sessions in Cuttack, Ahmedabad after 1st ODI loss to India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kevin-pietersen-slams-england-training-cuttack-ahmedabad-india-odis-9833339/
Content:
Former England batter Kevin Pietersen has slammed the English side that was routed 3-0 by India in the ODI series for not conducting a single training session since losing the T20Is 4-1 and the first ODI in Nagpur last week.
England suffered their second-heaviest defeat by runs on Wednesday in the third ODI in Ahmedabad after India piled on a massive 356 for five after being sent into bat. In reply, all Jos Buttler’s men could gather was 214 before being bundled inside 35 overs.
While the Indian team turned up for the optional net session in Cuttack before the second ODI, the visitors opted to stay back at their hotel in Bhubaneswar and hold a golf session.
“I’m sorry, but I am absolutely gobsmacked that England did not have ONE team practice session since losing the 1st ODI and losing the T20 series. How can this be? Seriously, how? I believe Joe Root was the only player to have a net this series, post Nagpur,” Pietersen wrote on X as he launched a scathing assessment.

“There isn’t a single sportsman on this planet who can honestly say, that they’d improve without practising whilst they’re getting beaten. There also cannot be one player in that England side that can sit on the plane leaving India and saying to themselves, they did everything they can to try help England win. And for that, I’m am actually incredibly sad this evening. Losing is fine if you’re giving your best to improve every day and if England didn’t train during this series then they didn’t try. Heartbreaking for any England fan!” Pietersen added.
England’s only victory on the eight-match white-ball tour came in the third T20I in Rajkot. They will open their Champions Trophy group B campaign against Australia on February 22 in Lahore.

Title: How Kerala pair Salman Nizar and Mohammed Azharuddeen repelled J&K fight to nick side into semifinals
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/salman-nizar-mohammed-azharuddeen-kerala-ranji-jammu-kashmir-9832860/
Content:
At one point, Jammu & Kashmir deployed six close-in fielders including the wicket keeper to crowd, converge on and cackle off two of Kerala’s quietest batsmen, into submission, while snapping sharp catches that brought four quick wickets. There was even a backward short leg, lingering in the batsman’s peripheral vicinity, and hissing away sweet inanities into the ears of Kerala’s flank defenders, Nos 7 and 8, Salman Nizar and Mohammed Azharuddeen
At 180/6, with a good part of two sessions left, Kerala were not even pretending to go for the 399 target J&K set them, clear that they would rub in the one-run first innings lead into the opponents’ faces the whole day. But defending 90 overs for a draw is an art. Nizar and Azhar did just that, to put Kerala into their second-ever Ranji semifinals. They would like nothing more than to beat Gujarat at home in Ahmedabad and take a shot at, possibly, Vidarbha. who beat them in the 2018 semis, should Mumbai be tamed at Nagpur in the other last-four encounter. But first, J&K had to be quelled at Pune.
Akshay Chandran and Sachin Baby (both on 48 runs) and even the 35+ veterans Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarwate, had eventually perished to J&K’s cloying tactic of spin-induced claustrophobia with Abid Mushtaq and Sahil Lotra, snaring two each. What India’s northern-most crown state might not have known is that India’s southern-most citadel, had the underrated Nizar and Azhar who have been pulling off these acts of holding off the last lines of defence, for a decade. They revel in it – ask Bengal or MP this season, for five-wickets-down is when Kerala start coming into their own.
“Salman just doesn’t get out and his batting average must be a million. Since U19, we have all been so jealous of him. And my habit is to play shots, so I had to majorly curb that instinct,” Azharuddeen said, after Kerala were taken to safety and finished at 295/6 with J&K unable to break through them.
While Nizar added 44 (162) to his first innings unbeaten 112, it was Azharuddeen who the Kerala tent literally serenaded from the tent with sing-song chants of ‘Kasargod’. The cricket-mad district, Azhar, says “made” him, with absolute strangers who loved the sport buying him high quality CA bats from Dubai and leaving them at his club once word got around he was talented. Azhar pays back the obeisance by playing with jersey No 14 – Kerala’s “14th district”, he informs.
The cricket-nutty district that speaks a variant of Malayalam, infused with Tulu and Kannadiga, borders Kumbla – Anil Kumble’s native town. The scenic hilly district has a hyper-competitive district league, but Azhar’s family really went the distance of cricket love. His eldest of seven brothers Kamaruddeen was a Md Azharuddin fan in 90s, so the newborn’s given name was swiftly changed from Ajmal to Azharuddeen. It was only in his teens that he googled and Youtubed the former India captain, and met him twice thereafter. Kerala also has a Sachin Baby, their captain.
But while cricket was taking off, and Kasargod doing everything to support the talent, Azharuddeen went to pieces after his mother passed away, making February a brutal month in his memories. “My father passed away when I was 15 and mother on February 2nd 2015, when I was 20. One of my brothers took me in, and Sanju Samson helped a lot.”
He would go on to get picked by RCB, spend the ‘bubble IPL’ learning aggressive batting from Virat Kohli, and wise up. Malyalam press had reported a few years ago, how a Mercedes Benz was on his list of spendings once he made it big. “I could’ve afforded Benz when RCB picked me. But I decided to build a house instead, realising a luxury car can be a liability in a few years,” he says. “Plus I got married last year. My wife will be happy if I build a house for her,” he says.
This prudence extends to when he’s battling for draws too. Earlier against MP, he batted 164 balls for 68. Against J&K egged on by coach Amey Khurasia to do it for his state, Kerala, he stayed put 118 balls for 67. “Back home we train on rank turners, so we were not scared of this silly point and short leg,” he would say of the 6-pack close-in.
“We had seen J&K bat in the third innings, and the wicket was complete paataa.” No demons – he declared, whistling and laughing out there in the middle though he “made mistakes thrice.” “Oh, those two pull shots and that cover drive,” he would near-apologise for some pretty stylish shots, of which there were 9 boundaries and 2 sixes.
“I knew Salman wouldn’t get out, so I just had to control my shotmaking instinct,” he would say of proper 5-day batting. Coach Khurasia had told him a pretty simple thing that hit deep. “He said, ‘when you are batting in the middle, you are growing as a batsman. In the dugout you learn nothing. So, bat long.”

J&K might’ve been hovering around them, but Salman Nizar was on a trip of his own. “He is just not bothered, let it be any situation, and he kept describing the biryani he would eat for dinner. He’s a big foodie. I kept laughing,” Azhar recalled, adding, their understanding is such that they rarely need to verbally call when running between wickets. Dinner menu fixed, they nibbled lightly on J&K bowling for high-tea.

Title: India vs England ODI series: Need for wicket-taking bowler the reason behind Varun Chakravarthy’s inclusion, says coach Gautam Gambhir
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shreyas-iyer-not-going-to-be-benched-series-gautam-gambhir-9832842/
Content:
With Jasprit Bumrah unavailable due to injury, strengthening the bowling attack was the motive behind the selection committee picking mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the 15-member squad and leaving opening batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal out for the ICC Champions Trophy to make space for him.
“The only reason was that we wanted another wicket-taking option in the middle (overs). And we know what Varun brings to the table. He can be a massive threat for a lot of teams who haven’t played him, and an X-factor as well,” head coach Gautam Gambhir explained after the 3-0 ODI series victory over England.
He was at pains to stress that team selection for specific matches was a matter of getting the composition right based on conditions and opponents.
“I’m not going to say that he’s going to start and all that stuff, but it’s always good to have a strong bowling line-up because if he can actually get those wickets in the middle, it’s always going to be an advantage. Otherwise, we know that Yashasvi has a fabulous future ahead,” Gambhir justified the selection call.
The latest changes to the Indian squad mean that the side will be flying to Dubai with four specialist spinners. When asked about the psychological advantage opponents may have with Bumrah missing from the entire tournament, the head coach said that the team just had to deal with it.
“If he’s not available, he’s not available. If he’s injured, he’s injured. Whether it’s me, whether it’s the captain, we can’t do much about it. Obviously, we know that he’s an important factor. But people like Harshit (Rana), people like Arshdeep (Singh), Mohammed Shami, all these guys will put their hands up. It’s a great opportunity for them to try and deliver for the country. As simple as it can get. For me, that’s important. What we don’t have, we don’t have,” he reasoned.
Shreyas Iyer had an excellent ODI series against England with three quality knocks. But he played the opening game only because Virat Kohli sat out due to an injury when Jaiswal had to be tried at the top of the order. The series gave the think tank a chance to try out a few combinations before leaving for the Champions Trophy. Gambhir stated that the team wanted to rotate the squad and give chances to everyone.

He said that Iyer was never supposed to be benched for the whole series.
“We wanted to give Yashasvi a go in the first game and see what he can bring to the table because he was in really good form in Australia. So we wanted to see what kind of innings he played. You can’t judge someone by one innings, but we always knew that Shreyas is going to be an important player for us. What he’s done at No. 4… whether at the (50-over) World Cup, he’s just an important player,” he explained.

There was for all purposes just one real fretful moment for India in England’s chase of a 357-run target in the third ODI in Ahmedabad. In six overs, England had blurred away to 60 without loss, and the left-handed dasher Ben Duckett was already on 34. It’s when India’s captain Rohit Sharma intervened.
Duckett had been limping from the start, with a groin niggle, but crash-landing the ball to all parts with his stand-and-deliver routine. After he smashed four consecutive seam-up balls from Arshdeep Singh, Rohit had enough at mid-off. With his characteristic shrug of disdain, he called the attention of Arshdeep, gesturing to his thigh. The point was made: that Duckett is struggling with a groin injury that hampers his movement and balls should be crafted keeping that in mind. Not offer balls that he can just stand and whack. Arshdeep got the message and slipped in a slower ball off the final ball of that over. A nod of approval came from Rohit.
Arshdeep started his next over as well with a slower delivery that was patted back by Duckett. The next ball was another change of pace — the knuckle-ball, and this time Duckett was sucked into a big heave-ho. And as the ball settled into his palms, a happy Rohit touched his head with his index-finger, indicating the rewards of using the brain.

That dismissal in the seventh over changed the character of the game, and the mood of the Indian team. Rohit had a couple more gestures at the fielders, urging them to focus more; once it was Harshit Rana who was gently wandering around fine-leg and nearly converted a single into two and Rohit spread his arms and had a spray. Little interventions like that, and India began to attack with more energy and focus.
Re-energised by the success of the slower ball, Arshdeep kept using them, and induced the other aggressive opener Phil Salt into bunting a slower bouncer to Axar at point in the 9th over.
Kuldeep Yadav, who had replaced Varun Chakravarthy for this game, found a nice rhythm, and ripped a loopy googly to get Tom Banton nick a forward prod to KL Rahul the wicketkeeper. The chase was all but done 14 balls later when in the 21st over, Axar Patel bowled a pretty full ball outside off, inducing Joe Root into inside-edging his intended cover drive onto the stumps.
Any residual doubts about the fate of the game was stubbed out when Jos Buttler edged a cut shot off Harshit Rana to his stumps to leave England hobbling at 154 for 5 in the 25th over. Even the most optimistic England supporter would have given up hope in the 27th over when Harry Brook chopped a defensive block off Rana to his stumps to leave England gasping at 161 for 6.
In contrast, India had controlled the mini-stumbles in their batting innings rather masterfully to post a big total. When Rohit Sharma fell in the seventh ball of the game, playing inside a line of Mark Wood delivery that didn’t tail in as much as he expected and edging it behind, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli stitched a substantial stand. They took their time as Wood, in particular, was shaping the ball at pace to test their outside edges a few times. But they didn’t show any recklessness, trying their best to ease into the game, and picking the bowlers to attack.

When Kohli’s nemesis Adil Rashid took him out again — 5th time in ODIs, 11th across formats, India rallied back with Gill and Shreyas Iyer. It was a rather fine delivery from Rashid. At Cuttack too he had taken out Kohli but there the batsman could be accused of pushing out at a leg break away from the body. Not in Ahmedabad. It landed on a length around the leg stump line and even as Kohli leaned forward to offer the full bat face as a shield, the ball spun that bit more to brush the bat splice enroute to the keeper. Indian batsmen in the years gone by would use their wrists to tap such leg breaks to the cover point region – Mohammad Azharuddin springs to mind, but they aren’t as masterful these days. Kohli has had his issues with leg spinners; Australia’s Adam Zampa has taken him down 8 times across formats.
Gill was almost ruthless with his shot selection, or rather the bowlers he targeted. Saqib Mahmood and the spinners bled and he flowed unhindered to his hundred.
Perhaps, Shreyas Iyer’s knock would have given as much comfort to the Indians as Gill’s. Only Virat Kohli’s swollen knee had forced them to give Shreyas a go in the first ODI, a baffling decision that has been made sillier by his every knock in this series. He has been trying a few tweaks to counter the short ball this season. In a Ranji game, he had stood with a very open stance — the head facing mid-on apart from the splayed feet.
In this series, he has changed that head position again towards a more traditional down the pitch look, though retained that open-foot placement. He has retreated behind the crease and that open-stance has allowed him to let his hands go smoothly and he has unfurled a few crunchy pulls. Mark Wood and co. had the pace to test out his technique, and he handled them pretty well. It’s a work in progress of course, but Shreyas in the lower middle order is a done deal with his counterattacking approach. India have Rahul to present the more circumspect option in case of a big collapse, in case Shreyas’s counterattack fails.

He pulled Saqib Mahmood, flayed Gus Atkinson – a deft help-along six over fine-leg to a ball on the thighs, a particular highlight, and smashed the spinners. He fell, tickling a down-leg ball from Rashid but by then had firmly put India on course for a 350-plus total. Rashid also took out Hardik Pandya, who had just carted him for two consecutive sixes, with another beauty – the ball ripping from leg stump line past the defensive prod to peg back the off stump. Though India couldn’t explode in the end, the middle over carnage was enough for them to sail through to 356, a total that proved way beyond England.

Title: WATCH: Pakistan fielders celebrate wildly in front of Temba Bavuma after his dismissal

Content:
The Pakistan vs South Africa ODI match witnessed a rather uncomfortable moment when the Men in Green players celebrated a little too wildly in front of Proteas captain Temba Bavuma after he was dismissed for 82 runs. It happened in the 29th over of the South African innings when Bavuma had a mix-up with Matthew Breetzke in the middle and was run out off a direct throw from Saud Shakeel.
Bavuma was walking back but he had to stop when Kamran Ghulam ran right in front of him to celebrate and was joined by Shakeel and Agha Salman. The players would ultimately move out of the way and Bavuma would make his way back but the umpires took a note of the wild celebrations and had a lengthy chat with Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan.
Speaking about the match, Breetzke and Heinrich Klaasen scored 83 and 87 respectively as South Africa posted 352/5 against the hosts at Karachi. Shaheen Shah Afridi was the pick of the bowlers, snapping up 2 wickets.

Earlier, South Africa won the toss and elected to bat against Pakistan in a must-win tri-nation series game for both teams at an upgraded National Bank Stadium.
New Zealand has already qualified for Friday’s final after beating Pakistan and South Africa at Lahore. Karachi is among three venues along with Lahore and Rawalpindi which is being upgraded by the Pakistan Cricket Board for the Champions Trophy starting next week.
South Africa is bolstered with the arrival of opening batter Toni de Zorzi, wicketkeeper-batter Klaasen, left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj and fast bowler Corbin Bosch, who all missed the six-wicket loss to New Zealand at Lahore.

Half of South Africa’s Champions Trophy squad, including Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada, will arrive over the weekend, a day after the tri-nation series final.

Title: IPL: Torrent Group acquires majority stake in Gujarat Titans in ownership shake up
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-torrent-group-majority-stake-gujarat-titans-ownership-9832459/
Content:
Torrent Group (Torrent) has acquired a majority stake of 67 per cent in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Gujarat Titans. The deal — which is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, including from the Board of Control for Cricket in India — will see previous owners CVC retain a minority stake of 33 per cent in the franchise.
Subject to the final approval from the IPL’s governing council, GT’s new owners could likely be involved from the IPL 2025 season. The upcoming IPL season will start on March 21.
CVC, a global private equity fund, had paid Rs 5625 crore in 2021 to buy the Gujarat Titans. The Ahmedabad-based franchise had gone on to win the IPL title in their first season itself in 2022 before making the final in the
next season. After losing captain and talisman Hardik Pandya after season 2 to the Mumbai Indians, Gujarat Titans had finished eighth in 2024. The franchise is based out of the Narendra Modi Stadium, which boasts of being the world’s largest cricket stadium with a capacity of over 100,000.
“Torrent Group has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire majority stake of 67% in the renowned Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise, Gujarat Titans (Irelia Sports India Private Limited) from Irelia Company Pte Ltd (“Irelia”) – currently fully owned by funds managed or advised by CVC,” a press release stated.
“As part of the deal, Irelia will retain a substantial minority stake of 33% in the franchise,” it further stated.
Jinal Mehta, Director of Torrent Group, said, “As sports continues to gain prominence in India, Torrent sees great potential in this rapidly growing sector. With the acquisition of a majority stake in the Gujarat Titans, we are excited to have the opportunity to elevate our fan experience and unlock new growth avenues in the years to come. We are committed to nurturing the Gujarat Titans team and creating a lasting legacy for everyone involved – our fanbase, the players and our employees.”
Siddharth Patel, Managing Partner at CVC, said: “We are excited to announce this deal, which marks the beginning of a new chapter in India’s most popular sporting event and our team Gujarat Titans. Our participation in Indian cricket started strongly, securing the Gujarat franchise, winning the IPL title in our first season and emerging as runners up in our second season.”

Title: How Shubman Gill walked down track to unsettle England’s pacers for his hundred in Ahmedabad
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-shubman-gill-walked-down-track-unsettle-england-pacers-9832471/
Content:
Rohit Sharma lofts the pacers straight. Virat Kohli swat-flicks. Shubman Gill walks. Of the current Indian batsmen, and perhaps it can be stretched to around the world, Gill owns this walking-down-the-track business to the pacers like no one else. The occasional problem, as witnessed in the Sydney Test, can come up when he runs down the pitch, but he more or less bosses with the walk-down. There is also Yashasvi Jaiswal, who religiously trains for that shot in nets, but Gill has been at it far longer and more effectively.
It’s a shot he repeatedly went for in the third ODI against England in Ahmedabad—where he now has an international hundred in every format—using it to ensure the pacers are never sure of the right length to bowl at him or at the least, settle into a pattern.
IND vs ENG 3rd ODI Match LIVE Cricket Score: Watch Here
Not that there have not been batsmen who have done it before. In particular, two batsmen deployed that tactic consistently. Australia’s Matthew Hayden, and before him South Africa’s Gary Kirsten. Interestingly, both saw the approach rather differently in their minds.
Kirsten was one of the earliest to develop that process, and he didn’t see it as risky or adrenalin-kicker, but as an effective tool to score runs. “It was like a release shot that I felt was fairly low risk. But that certainly did help me get the ball to the boundary when I was under pressure. So yes, it was something that I developed in my game that was really helpful to me,” Kirsten once told The Indian Express.
On the other hand, Hayden saw it as a tool of intimidation. “There’s a tremendous adrenaline rush when you walk down the track. I do it when the bowlers settle into a pattern of play where you think they are bowling very well. Walking down is a good way to unsettle play,” Hayden once said. “It’s really throwing out a challenge to them: I know you’re bowling really well here, but I am not going to let you.”

In between these two approaches lies Gill’s walk. There is a calmness and lack of bossiness in his walk that is in contrast to Hayden’s snarl. There is a bit more aggression than was seen in Kirsten’s approach. Hayden talked about how he just wanted to “watch the ball and smash wherever it was bowled” when he did that, and Kirsten was more cautious, willing to wrist it past square or place it through cover point or on drive. Sourav Ganguly would do it and mostly slap it through cover point. Gill mostly likes to drive them on the up in the V.
He started that as early as the sixth ball he faced, though he drove Saqib Mahmood straight to mid-off. He had started the innings slowly, soaking up 10 dot balls before he creamed one through covers. He again walked down the track two balls later to Saqib, and again mid-off intervened.
A few balls later came the first run-scoring shot with that approach. In the 5th over, again off Saqib, he not only walked down but also held his head gloriously still at impact, and punched to the straight boundary. That head position is quite something to see when he does the walk, almost as if he makes an extra effort to keep it still when he is down the track. Something that occasionally goes awry for him when he is rushing down the track as it did in Sydney on that brain-fade moment in the second innings with the series on the line. But even there, when he isn’t exactly in the slog mode, he keeps it pretty composed. There were a few charges in Ahmedabad where he bashed the bowlers – again mostly in the arc from long-on to long-off.
Karsan Ghavri, the former India pacer, who was one of the early coaches and shaped fundamentals, has a chuckle about that walk. “He certainly didn’t have that then. I can see the occasional running down the track probably but not the walk. He used to bat from the crease mostly, and his technique was tight. He has developed the walking shot for the white-ball cricket as it can affect the bowlers. I just wish he doesn’t run down the track in Tests!” Clearly, the Sydney dash hasn’t faded from memory yet.
On his best days, he uses the walk strategically against pacers like Saqib who like to hit the back of length to good length. That walk gets him close, also pressurises the bowlers into changing lengths – and with his penchant to punch on the up, he is more than ready if they drag back the length. At times they try to hurl it wider, and he then frees his arms to carve the ball up and over the off-side field. Or when they drag it too short, he unfurls the flat-batted pull, but again in that V.
Like it happened in the 9th over, with Saqib. The first attempt to walk a few paces had the ball punched to mid-off, a dot ball but that had the bowler thinking. Next time, he did in the same over, Saqib hurled it far shorter and pretty much straight, and Gill biffed it flat batted over mid-on.
Gill also tried that approach a couple of times to the slower Gus Atkinson but for some reason, perhaps due the lack of pace that throttled the intended punches, it wasn’t that effective. And so he began to charge him, dash down the track, and hammered him. As he would do in the 14th over, over long-on.
Eventually came the hundred moment with a glorious shot. This wasn’t the walk, but it’s a shot so graceful that’s worth mentioning. He did his usual trigger movement of going back and a touch across and as the 145.3 kmph length delivery tailed in towards the middle stump, he calmly leaned into it to gorgeously wrist it between mid-on and deep midwicket fielder. He held the bat up on his left hand, unusual for a right-handed batsman, and holding the helmet in his right hand, he did a graceful bow to the crowd to cap a knock that oozed off grace.

Title: Why are India and England players wearing green armbands in 3rd ODI in Ahmedabad?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-england-players-3rd-odi-wear-green-armbands-organ-donation-9832443/
Content:
The Indian and England players sported green armbands on Wednesday for the 3rd ODI at the Narendra Modi Stadium in order to support the BCCI’s initiative of “Donate Organs, Save Lives” campaign. “Both teams are wearing green arm bands to support BCCI’s initiative ‘Donate Organs, Save Lives’. The initiative is spearheaded by ICC Chairman Mr Jay Shah,” a BCCI release stated.
“Today, we’re wearing green ribbons alongside India to support the ‘Donate Organs, Save Lives’ initiative,” the England Cricket X handle also posted.
The initiative was supported by several Indian players, including Virat Kohli and vice-captain Shubman Gill. “Score the ultimate century. Your organs can help others live beyond your lifetime. Register as a donor and make every life count,” Kohli said in a video shared by the BCCI.
The two teams are wearing green arm bands to support BCCI’s initiative "Donate Organs, Save Lives”.
The initiative is spearheaded by ICC Chairman Mr Jay Shah.
Pledge, spread the word, and let's be a part of something truly meaningful.#DonateOrgansSaveLives | @JayShah pic.twitter.com/QQ532W26wd
— BCCI (@BCCI) February 12, 2025
Gill added: “Be the captain of life. Just like a captain leads the team to victory, you can lead someone to life by pledging to donate your organs.” Other Indian cricketers to support the initiative were batters Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul.
“One donor can save up to eight lives. Pledge today and hit a six for humanity,” Iyer said.
Rahul added: “Play the ultimate winning shot. Your decision to donate your organs can be the match winning moment in someone’s life. Be a hero off the field too.”
In the match, Gill scored his seventh hundred as India posted a commanding 356 all out in 50 overs against England.

The prolific Gill smashed 112 off 102 balls with 14 boundaries and three sixes. He got fine support from veteran Virat Kohli (52 off 55 balls) and Shreyas Iyer (78 off 64 balls). There were two century stands — 116 for the second wicket between Gill and Kohli and 104 between Gill and Iyer.
Leg-spinner Adil Rashid was the pick of the England bowlers with 4 for 64 in 10 overs.

Title: SL vs AUS 1st ODI: Sri Lanka pulls off 49-run win over Australia ahead of Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sl-vs-aus-1st-odi-sri-lanka-defeat-australia-champions-trophy-9832355/
Content:
With Australia’s squad for the Champions Trophy in disarray due to the absence of a lot of big guns, the 2023 ODI World Cup winners suffered an almighty shock just a week before the 50-over extravaganza after they lost to Sri Lanka by 49 runs in the 1st ODI on Wednesday.
Batting first, Sri Lanka posted 214 with the help of captain Charith Asalanka’s 127 runs while just three other batters could get to two digits. The rest 7 could only muster single digit scores with openers Pathum Nissanka and Avishka Fernando scoring just 4 and 1 respectively. Sean Abbott was the pick of the Australia bowlers taking 3 wickets.
Chasing the modest target, Australia’s wicketkeeper Alex Carey top scored with 41 runs while Aaron Hardie came next with 31. Matthew Short (0), Jake Fraser-McGurk (2), Cooper Connolly (3), captain Steve Smith (12) and Marnus Labuschagne (15) were all the big names who failed to create an impact. Maheesh Theekshana was the best bowler for Sri Lanka, taking 4 wickets.
Australia faced a lot of injury concerns soon after they announced the provisional squad for the Champions Trophy. And all of it has come true with their entire frontline pace pack which includes their captain Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood are ruled out with injuries.

And to make it worse fellow speedster Mitchell Starc has withdrawn from the tournament citing personal reasons. It is a huge blow for a team that hasn’t won a match in the last two editions of the Champions Trophy with the last win being in the final of the 2009 edition. Apart from the fast bowler, Australia are also without their all-rounder Mitchell Marsh — who is also injured and Marcus Stoinis who announced shock retirement last week.

Former England player Kevin Pietersen on Wednesday slammed opener Ben Duckett for saying that he is fine losing the ongoing bilateral series to India 3-0 as long as England go on to win the upcoming Champions Trophy. “This is a massive series, but the Champions Trophy is the big competition. If we lose 3-0 to India, I don’t care as long as we beat them in the final in the Champions Trophy. No one will probably look back on this series if we go and do the business in that competition,” Duckett said in a conversation with Sky Sports after losing the 2nd ODI in Cuttack.
“Goodness me, it’s pretty poor that Duckett would say that he doesn’t care if England lose today and lose 3-0 to India. Context is important when reading quotes, but those words should NOT have been said!
NEVER!,” Pietersen posted on X.
England are already 0-2 behind in the series after losing the first 2 matches in Nagpur and Cuttack. Before that, they had also lost the T20I series 4-1.
Goodness me, it’s pretty poor that Duckett would say that he doesn’t care if England lose today and lose 3-0 to India. Context is important when reading quotes, but those words should NOT have been said! NEVER!

On Wednesday, England skipper Jos Buttler won the toss and opted to field against India in the third and final ODI. England made one change with Tom Banton replacing Jamie Overton.
For India, Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar and Arshdeep Singh replaced the trio of Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami and Varun Chakravarthy.

While Jadeja and Shami were rested, Varun missed out due to an injury. “Varun Chakaravarthy was unavailable for selection for the 3rd ODI due to a sore right calf,” BCCI said in an update.
India won the first two ODIs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

The 25-year-old Gill also became the quickest batter to reach 2500 ODI runs during his milestone 50th match in the format, overtaking South Africa’s Hashim Amla who got to the milestone previously in 51 innings. Batting in his 131st innings across formats, Gill also reached 5,000 international runs during the knock.
Following scores of 87 and 60 in the first two matches of the series, Gill also rose to the second spot in the latest ICC ODI batting rankings on Wednesday, eclipsing India captain Rohit Sharma.
Gill enjoys a favourable record batting in Ahmedabad where he smashed his highest T20I score with an unbeaten 126 against New Zealand in February 2023. In his next outing at the venue in March that year, Gill smashed his maiden Test century at the venue against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, scoring 128 off 251 balls.
The Gujarat Titans captain averages nearly 80 at the ground across nine innings with Ahmedabad being the second venue where he has aggregated at least 400 runs after the Harare Stadium in Zimbabwe.

It is not just India who will have to deal with the absence of a top player in Jasprit Bumrah at the Champions Trophy. With the tournament coming at the fag end of a long season, several teams are missing key players with world champions Australia being the worst affected. Here is a look at the depleted squads
Their entire frontline pace pack which includes their captain Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood are ruled out with injuries. And to make it worse, fellow speedster Mitchell Starc has withdrawn from the tournament citing personal reasons. It is a huge blow for a team that hasn’t won a match in the last two editions of the Champions Trophy with the last win being in the final of the 2009 edition. Apart from the fast bowlers, Australia are also without their all-rounder Mitchell Marsh, who is also injured, and Marcus Stoinis who announced shock retirement last week.
In Cummins absence, Steve Smith has been named captain. Sean Abbott, Ben Dwarshuis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Spencer Johnson and Tanveer Sangha have been included in the updated squad.
Full squad: Steve Smith (capt), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.
The Champions Trophy provides a perfect opportunity to end South Africa’s ICC trophy jinx. To do so, the Proteas will have to make do without pacer Anrich Nortje and Gerald Coetzee who will miss the tournament because of injury. While Coetzee was injured before the provisional squad was announced, in place of Nortje, South Africa have named 30-year-old seam bowling all-rounder Corbin Bosch.
Full squad: Temba Bavuma (capt), Corbin Bosch , Tony de Zorzi, Marco Jansen, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tabraiz Shamsi, Tristan Stubbs, Rassie van der Dussen.
For Afghanistan, which made the semifinals of the T20 World Cup last year, will make their Champions Trophy debut. And placed in the group that includes England, Australia and South Africa, they will miss the young spin bowling sensation Allah Ghazanfar because of a fracture in the L4 vertebra. The 18-year-old who bowls off-spin has been generating plenty of interest from T20 franchises across the globe and was expected to form a lethal partnership with Rashid Khan & Co.
Full squad: Hashmatullah Shahidi (capt), Ibrahim Zadran, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sediqullah Atal, Rahmat Shah (vice-capt), Azmatullah Omarzai, Gulbadin Naib, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Fareeh Ahmad, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Nangeyalia Kharote, Naveed Zadran, Noor Ahmad.
Two other teams are also sweating over the availability of two key players. New Zealand are keeping a close eye on opener Rachin Ravindra who was hit by the ball under floodlights and needed stitches. He has been ruled out of the ongoing tri-series in Pakistan, but is expected to be fit for the later stages of the Champions Trophy.

Pakistan, meanwhile, are keeping their fingers crossed over fast bowler Haris Rauf. The pacer walked away after bowling just 6.2 overs in their opening ODI against New Zealand, which they lost. Pakistan aren’t pressing for a replacement as yet in the hope he will regain fitness by the time the tournament commences.

Title: ‘When they’re talking about out of form and out of runs..’: Brad Haddin on Marnus Labuschagne regaining form
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/marnus-labuschagne-poor-form-australia-vs-sri-lanka-9831555/
Content:
With Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne having another disappointing Test series scoring 50 runs at an average of 25 in during Australia’s 2-0 win in the Two test series against Australia, the South Africa born cricketer has been seeing a decline in his Test average since last two years. Labuschagne scored a total of 232 runs at an average of 25.77 in the recent Border Gavaskar Trophy and with calls of sacking him for the West Indies tour and WTC final, former Australian wicket-keeper Brad Haddin has backed the 30-year-old batsman.
“I don’t think he’s under pressure in the next few Test matches. I think he’s done enough to have earned the right to play at least the next four Test matches… When they’re talking about out of form and out of runs… all his training habits are the same, he’s getting in the right position but it’s his mindset,” Haddin said on the Willow Talk Cricket Podcast.
Labuschagne, who made his Test debut against Pakistan in 2018, had scored 3041 runs in his first 30 Tests with an average of 60.82 including ten centuries. The remarkable run also saw him climbing to the top of the ICC Test rankings. Post that, Labuschagne has managed to score 1355 runs at an average of 30.79 including only one century in 27 Test matches. With Australia playing three Test matches in West Indies followed by the WTC final against South Africa, former Australian wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist believes Labuschagne can flourish as an opener in the coming Test matches for Australia. All-rounder Cameron Green is expected to make a return post an injury and with Travis Head moving to middle-order, Gilchrist sees an opportunity for Labuschagne. “They’re flush with choices particularly if Green comes back fit to bat. It’ll boil down to the conditions over there and who they think is going to do the best job for those five days… It wouldn’t surprise me (that Marnus) may well be in the calculations if they’ve got to replace an opener with Travis going back to five. They might even say, ‘right Marnus, you go up there,’ if they want to retain him in the team. They obviously put a lot of value on him being in the team and he played a couple of really reliable knocks in the summer (against India) without being back up to the lofty standards he set over the last few years,” Gilchrist told Australian media.
Australian skipper Steve Smith too has backed Labuschagne and compared the batsman to his revival in Test cricket. “Marn’s similar to me in a way. Throughout the summer I think he’s actually batting quite nicely, and there’s a difference between being out of form and out of runs, and I’ve seen Marnus do it, we know he can do it. I don’t think he’s out of form, personally. I’ve watched him train and watched him play and a lot of the things he’s done so well are there. Things can turn around pretty quickly. He’d love to score more runs and we’d love him to score more runs, but in my opinion it’s just around the corner,” Smith told reporters earlier.

Title: ‘I thought I played well in that WTC final’: Ajinkya Rahane on getting dropped months after 2023 final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ajinkya-rahane-wtc-final-test-drop-ranji-trophy-2025-9831517/
Content:
While it has been close to 18 months since Ajinkya Rahane last played Test cricket for India, the 36-year-old has not been in the Indian selectors’ scheme of things in Test cricket at present. While the Mumbai batsman was the top scorer for India with a total of 135 runs in the World Test Championship final against Australia at the Oval in 2023, a final which India lost by 209 runs, Rahane was appointed India’s vice-captain for the West Indies tour. The Mumbai batsman was dropped after the West Indies tour and has not played in a Test match for India since then. Rahane smashed a second innings’ century against Haryana in Mumbai’s win in the Ranji Trophy quarter-finals at Kolkata and the batsman remembered the WTC final performance saying he has been batting well at present.
“I am not thinking about the future at all. But I do know that I am batting well. I had a good performance in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. This Ranji Trophy season is going well too. I batted nicely in the World Test Championship final in 2023 too. After that, I got dropped. Being selected or not selected is another matter, and the job of the selectors. But I thought I played well in that WTC final.” Rahane told reporters after Mumbai’s win.
Rahane had scores of 8 and 3 in the two Tests against West Indies post the WTC final and did not bat during two innings during the two-Test tour. This year, Rahane was the highest scorer in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy amassing 469 runs at a strike rate of 164.56. The right-handed batsman, who has played in 85 Tests for India amassing 5077 runs, has amassed 437 runs with an average close to 40 in Ranji Trophy this season. “In all this, I feel I have a lot of cricket left in me. That’s why I am playing domestic cricket consistently. I just have one goal right now, and that is to play cricket with a positive mindset, and whatever happens after that, happens. Domestic cricket has given me everything. I still have that jazba(passion) within me. Before any match, I still have that desire and hunger that I possessed earlier. I don’t know about the future, but I do know I am far from done. That’s why I have been giving my 100% in domestic cricket,” Rahane told reporters.
Rahane was picked up for Rs 1.5 crore by Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL Mega auction last year. The Mumbai batsman has been in contention for the captaincy of Kolkata Knight Riders and shared his thoughts over the issue. “They have not chatted about KKR captaincy with me at all. If they’d have spoken, you journalists would’ve known about it and you guys would’ve been the ones informing me. Until then, I’ll not bother checking my phone. I have had to see a lot of different challenges. I have captained before, and I have found myself in a variety of situations over the years. I know how to handle any situation in front of me. That’s why I am always ready for whatever is thrown at me,” said Rahane.

Title: India vs England 3rd ODI: How will pitch for IND vs ENG Ahmedabad ODI play and what’s weather like in city?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-pitch-report-weather-india-ahmedabad-odi-9831006/
Content:
India and England face off in the final ODI of their three-match series at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Wednesday in a game that is a dead rubber on paper, but will generate plenty of interest nonetheless. Rohit Sharma and Co play in the game hours after the devastating announcement that Jasprit Bumrah will not be travelling with the Indian team for the ICC Champions Trophy.
In other news, India will be hoping that star batter Virat Kohli hits form in the final ODI before the ICC Champions Trophy. He is 89 runs short of becoming only the third batter in history to score 14,000 runs in the format.
Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium is known for offering a balanced pitch. The 22-yard strip should provide assistance to both the batters and bowlers.
Traditionally, the surface starts with good bounce and carry, conditions which favour fast bowlers in the initial overs. But then as the game ages, the pitch at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium tends to settle down. This makes batting at the ground easier, especially under lights. The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium is expected to be good for batting, with some assistance for pacers early on. Spinners will be crucial in the middle overs, and a first-innings score of 270+ will be competitive.
According to weather forecast for Wednesday for Ahmedabad, the India vs England 3rd ODI at Narendra Modi Stadium is expected to have clear skies with no chance of rain. Humidity will be a factor. The maximum temperature is predicted to be around 31 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature may drop to 15 degrees in the evening. The humidity level is estimated to be around 38%. Overall, the weather forecast looks promising for a full and uninterrupted cricket match.

Title: Mumbai Indians spin sensation ruled out of IPL 2025, Champions Trophy with fracture
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mumbai-indians-allah-ghazanfar-fracture-out-champions-trophy-ipl-2025-9831229/
Content:
Mumbai Indians’ Afghanistan spin sensation Allah Ghazanfar has been ruled out of action for up to four months, leaving the youngster out of the Champions Trophy tournament slated to begin next week in Pakistan.
Ghazanfar has been replaced by Nangyal Kharoti in Afghanistan’s 15-member squad for the tournament, the Afghanistan Cricket Board announced on Wednesday.
According to ACB, Ghazanfar has suffered a severe fracture that will need a recovery period of at least four months. “AM Ghazanfar, has been ruled out of the ICC Champions Trophy due to a fracture in the L4 vertebra, specifically in the left pars interarticularis. He sustained the injury during Afghanistan’s recently held tour of Zimbabwe, and will be sidelined for a minimum of four months and will remain under treatment during this period,” the ACB wrote in its statement.
The injury will also rule Ghazanfar out of the upcoming IPL 2025 season where he was due to represent five-time champions Mumbai Indians after having been picked up during the IPL 2025 Mega Auction last November.
Ghazanfar was the player of the match in the final against Sri Lanka A in the Emerging teams tournament last year when he had snapped up two wickets to help his team to win their maiden trophy. The 18-year-old Ghazanfar was a member of the Kolkata Knight Riders squad which went on to win the 2024 Indian Premier League, drafted in for the injured Mujeeb Ur Rahman but did not play a single game for the franchise.
Ghazanfar hit the jackpot when MI snapped him up for Rs 4.8 crore in the mega auction, placing him alongside Mitchell Santner among their front-line spinners for the forthcoming season.

Title: Australia spinner Matt Kuhnemann reported for suspect bowling action in Sri Lanka series
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-spinner-matt-kuhnemann-suspect-action-report-sri-lanka-9831207/
Content:
Australia left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has been reported for a suspect bowling action during the team’s 2-0 whitewash series win over Sri Lanka in Galle last week.
Playing only his second Test series after debuting during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India in 2023, the 28-year-old Kuhnemann topped the bowling charts in Sri Lanka with 16 wickets at 17.18. Kuhnemann became Australia’s most prolific left-arm tweaker in Sri Lanka, joining the squad after recovering from a dislocated and fractured thumb during the Big Bash League earlier in January.
However, according to Cricket Australia, Kuhnemann’s action was questioned during his impressive outings, which will now force him to undergo a mandatory bowling action analysis test within three weeks. Should he fail to clear the test, Kuhnemann will be barred from bowling in international cricket until he is cleared with a modified action.
The incident marks the first time the Tasmanian bowler’s action has come under scrutiny since his professional debut in 2017.
According to a Code Sports report, Kuhnemann’s testing is likely to take place at Brisbane’s Centre of Excellence where a bio-mechanist will test the action and submit the findings to the International Cricket Council (ICC).
“The Australian team was notified of the match officials’ referral following the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle and will support Matt through the process of clearing this matter,” a Cricket Australia spokesperson said.
“Matt has played 124 professional matches since his debut in 2017, including five Test matches and four One-Day Internationals. He has played 55 Big Bash League games since 2018.
“This is the first time in those eight years of professional cricket that his action has been questioned.”
While he awaits the test and the following results, CA confirmed that Kuhnemann will be available to play domestic cricket for Tasmania.

Title: IND vs ENG 3rd ODI: Arshdeep Singh to return in place of Mohammed Shami, Rishabh Pant might get a look in
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-3rd-odi-predicted-playing-11-arshdeep-rishabh-pant-9830844/
Content:
With the ODI series already wrapped up in the last match at Cuttack, India will likely give some players who haven’t had the opportunity to play in the first two matches, a chance to impress. With Jasprit Bumrah ruled out of the Champions Trophy, India will look to their pace trio of Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh and Nitish Rana to have an impact in the 50-over tournament.
Rishabh Pant might also get a look in in this match as India will look to keep an eye on the champions Trophy and give the players in the squad as much match practice as possible. With the 3rd ODI at the Narendra Modi Stadium the last one before the Champions Trophy, the Men in Blue will want to check the all-round ability of the squad.
With Bumrah ruled out of the Champions Trophy, India will look to keep veteran pacer Shami wrapped in cotton wool till the Champions Trophy. The pacer slowly and steadily found his rhythm, taking 2 wickets in 2 matches against England in the ODI series. With the series in the bag, India will likely give Arshdeep a whirl along with Harshit Rana to keep the Punjab pacer match-ready while affording Shami a much-needed timeout.
India might also provide Rishabh Pant a chance to showcase his skill in the last match and give Rahul some rest before the team flies off to Dubai for the Champions Trophy. Pant, who is a sure-shot starter in the game’s shortest and longest format, hasn’t really made a strong foot-hold in the 50-overs game. But on Wednesday, India might opt to go with the swashbuckling keeper batter to keep him match-fit for the Champions Trophy. If Rahul suffers an injury during the CT, India will have a strong replacement on the bench.

India predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (WK), Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakarvarthy, Arshdeep Singh
England predicted XI: Ben Duckett, Phil Salt (wk), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (c), Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood

Australia were dealt a huge blow as pacer Mitchell Starc opted out of the forthcoming Champions Trophy in Pakistan due to personal reasons, leaving the world champions without their ‘Big 3’ seam trio, including Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.
With Cummins missing out, Australia have named Steve Smith as the skipper of the rejigged 15-member side that also had to weigh in for the injured Mitchell Marsh and Marcus Stoinis who announced his retirement last week.
Australia will now have to contend with an inexperienced quarter of seam bowlers in Sean Abbott, Spencer Johnson, Ben Dwarshuis and Nathan Ellis.
Selectors said Starc would also not be available for the two warmup ODIs against Sri Lanka in Colombo, the first starting later on Wednesday.
“We understand and respect Mitch’s decision,” selector George Bailey said in a statement on Wednesday.
“His loss is of course a blow for the Champions Trophy campaign but does provide an opportunity to someone else to make a mark on the tournament.”
Power hitter Jake Fraser-McGurk has been included in the 15-man squad and may replace Marsh at number three in the batting, with Matt Short and Travis Head likely to open. Legspinner Tanveer Sangha has also claimed a spot, having played the last of his two ODIs in September 2023 away to India.
Australia Champions Trophy 2025 final squad: Steve Smith (capt), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah out of Champions Trophy squad, Varun Chakravarthy in at Yashasvi Jaiswal’s expense
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-india-squad-updated-jasprit-bumrah-ruled-out-varun-yashasvi-9830848/
Content:
India’s prospects at the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy got a major jolt with pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah ruled out of the tournament on Tuesday. Bumrah has a lower back injury suffered during the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Sydney last month and has been out of action since. The national selectors have included pacer Harshit Rana as his replacement in the 15-member squad.
In another selectorial call, mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, enjoying a purple patch in white-ball cricket, has been included at the expense of opening batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal. The left-hander is one of the non-travelling substitutes, along with pacer Mohammed Siraj and all-rounder Shivam Dube. Shreyas Iyer, who played the first ODI against England only because Virat Kohli was injured and Jaiswal had to be tried at the top of the order, now finds himself in the 15 with the opener omitted.
The Champions Trophy begins on February 19 in Pakistan, but India’s games will be played in Dubai. They will face Bangladesh on February 20, Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 3.
🚨 NEWS 🚨
Fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury. Harshit Rana named replacement.

— BCCI (@BCCI) February 11, 2025
The Indian Express had earlier reported that Bumrah’s availability was anyway unlikely for the group stages of the Champions Trophy and if he indeed played any part in the competition, it would be in the semifinal or final, if India make it. The semi-finals are on March 4 and 5 with the final on March 9.
India refused to travel to Pakistan citing security concerns which forced the ICC to adopt a hybrid model for the tournament.
The national selectors were kept updated about Bumrah’s injury status and they were hopeful that he would be fit before the start of the tournament. He had even been picked for the ongoing three-match ODI series against England at home with the hope that the pacer could play the third game in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, but he is yet to recover from his injury.
Senior selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar had earlier stated that Bumrah had to off-load for five weeks and wasn’t available for the first two ODIs against England as he hasn’t begun to bowl yet.
A day before the last date for teams to make changes to their preliminary Champions League squad, the selection panel met virtually on Tuesday.
Bumrah has had back issues earlier and missed nearly 11 months of cricket — from September 2022 to August 2023 — after undergoing surgery. He made a comeback in a T20I against Ireland. The selectors and team management have been careful not to over-burden the leader of their pace attack. During the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs in five Test matches with an average of 13.06 and a strike rate of 28.3, and was often the only bowler to have any impact on the home team. He also was the stand-in captain for the first Test in Perth after Rohit Sharma skipped the match for the birth of his second child. He also captained the side for the final Test in Sydney when Rohit decided to sit out because of poor batting form.

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025: Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd. Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.
Non Travelling substitutes: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Mohammed Siraj and Shivam Dube.

Title: We haven’t cracked the code of how to cross the line in the knockouts: Tamil Nadu coach Lakshmipathy Balaji
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/lakshmipathy-balaji-tamil-nadu-coach-knockouts-code-9830826/
Content:
The writing was pretty much on the wall for Tamil Nadu. It was imprinted the moment they lost to Jharkhand and thereby booked a quarterfinals date with Vidarbha in Nagpur. And after four days, the inevitable happened on Tuesday as Vidarbha defeated Tamil Nadu by a massive 198-run margin to confirm another quarterfinal exit. As has been the story forever in Ranji Trophy knockouts, it was with the bat where they lost again on a green top in an away fixture, prolonging their red-ball title drought for another season at least.
Having made the semi-finals last season, TN had the best intentions to go a step further this time, with a lot of focus put primarily on Ranji Trophy.  Having remained unbeaten in the first half of the season, it was in the last two matches – when it mattered – that they came up short. And compared to previous performances on green tops, this should hurt TN, as Vidarbha’s lower-order showed better application while batting first. Coming to bat on the second afternoon, TN slid to 38/4 and never recovered, exposing their struggles in the absence of Baba Indrajith.
“It’s been there. It’s not today. It’s been there ever since I started playing,” TN head coach Lakshmipathy Balaji told The Indian Express. “We haven’t cracked the code of how to cross the line in the knockouts. I have been part of three finals apart from a number of semi-finals and quarter-finals. When you keep getting there consistently, you will know how to cross the line. We didn’t make the knockouts for five seasons in a row, and for this group, this is the second successive outing and it has to happen consistently and that’s when you know how to cross the line. If you look at the Mumbai game and this, it is one player who has taken the game away. You need to learn how to overcome those situations, ” Balaji added.
Having chosen to invest in a young crop of batsmen, TN did send them on an exposure trip to the UK, ensuring the batting group remained the same across formats to grow as a pack. But all of it seemed futile in the end, especially if one factors the mode of dismissals. With Indrajith out injured, Vijay Shankar and N Jagadeesan happened to be their most experienced batsmen, but despite tallying 476 and 674 runs, their struggles in the knockouts continued this time. And the young crop, barring Andre Siddarth, crumbled to 225 & 202 in both the innings.
“This season two of them have scored over 600 and two over 400, which is good enough to take you to knockouts. From there on, you need individuals to step up. Six to seven of them are playing their second season and two different classes are coming together. Since they play all formats, they need to adapt, the quicker you reset depending upon the format, quicker you will be able to adapt. We knew what we lacked, which is why we took them to the UK,” Balaji said.
Along the way, they have fought adversities as well, losing several first choice players – Indrajith, Shahrukh Khan, Gurjapneet Singh, Sandeep Warrier, Sonu Yadav, B Sai Sudharsan – to injuries. While their absence was felt more in white-ball, in Ranji they managed it better. And more importantly, for the first time in decades, they went about assembling a pack of fast bowlers. Sans a quality pace pack they have shown a tendency to struggle in away fixtures.
“Take Mumbai or Karnataka, when they do well, they have a good set of pacers and it happens to them because they give them opportunities and over time, they mature as a pack and combine together to perform as a unit. We have found a good crop of fast bowlers this season, including the two teenagers – Pranav Raghavendra and Deepesh – and you have to be patient with them and allow them to develop. You have to give them more chances, create a pool and ensure they stay injury-free. They are all around 23-24, and by 25-26 they mature, so you need to take good care of them. We need to show faith in them,” Balaji said.

Having assembled a core of young players with the average age of the squad being 23-24 throughout the season, Balaji says the squad will need time. “This core is young, and the learning has been quite fast.  It is something which I really like from outside. Results-wise, in cricket and in any sport, you have to go the distance. For this side it is a work in progress and it is not very far. We have just assembled a core and when we reach knockouts, this team should be on autopilot mode – it should know how to close out situations and games. It has to become their comfort zone. I expected a lot more, but it has been a learning experience for me as well,” Balaji added.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Paras Dogra leads J&K from the front with ton as quarterfinal against Kerala on knife’s edge
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/paras-dogra-century-jammu-kashmir-ranji-trophy-ton-kerala-9830636/
Content:
Maybe, the Jammu & Kashmir Ranji team needed a captain who wasn’t an intimidating, authority figure. Paras Dogra had 10,000 domestic runs for his ancestral state Himachal Pradesh and as a guest player for Pondicherry. With J&K, he just shared a smattering of Dogri and Kangri dialects. But the Delhi-born 40-year-old, with a chill temperament and no particular intention of stamping his 10,000-run clout, candidly admitted to being super-fascinated by the high quality of bowlers and hitters J&K had.
He was mentoring them alright when they bowled, but hadn’t been among the runs this season. He’s not prone to talking down to the juniors anyway, but his batting struggles strangely made him one of the boys. A hard-trying team with an earnestly-trying skipper, just got things to click. On Tuesday, with J&K having conceded a 1-run first innings lead (281 and 280) to Kerala , Dogra hit a sturdy century – striking 132 from 232 balls, while shepherding partnerships of 146 (261 balls) with Kanhaiya Wadhawan and 50 (65) with Sahil Lotra.
J&K set Kerala an enticing target of 399, after declaring on 398/9. It’s a tricky total to chase on the final day with Kerala 100-2 and their middle order having to walk the tightrope of going for an outright win or surviving 90 overs. J&K bowling being a particularly pugnacious unit is likely to keep Day 5 on a knife’s edge.
The 1-run lead is a safety net to play out a draw, but like Dogra said, “It’s a matter of 8 good (wicket-taking) balls.” When stated that way, the potential to incite panic, is immense. Dogra is a shrewd leader in mind games – with or without runs in his individual kitty.
His unique ability to get his bowlers to believe they can beat any side – they already beat Mumbai and Baroda as a pack – might have a bearing on inducing harakiri in Kerala ranks. It’s a thrilling last day with Dogra and coach Ajay Sharma on one side and Kerala’s Amey Khurasiya and lynchpin Jalaj Saxena on the other.
Dogra happily admits to being a fan of his bowlers, glad to be their designated puppeteer. “When I joined the team, I was very impressed with how good their fast bowling is. They just need someone to take those small decisions,” he says, adding that he’s been guiding the young & restless pacers towards patience. “It’s about bowlers bowling maidens, bowling in the right areas. I know my bowlers can crack through any batting order, and that’s what we will try.”
Guiding the enforcers and the containing workhorses has been about teaching them not to force matters. “They tend to rush for wickets. I tell them ‘let things come to you.’ That’s 5-day cricket,” he says about working the batsmen and setting up wickets. What Dogra also did was make them feel like a million bucks. “I firmly believe 5 good bowlers can win you tournaments. Good batsmen only win you matches,” he states.
It’s been more a case of him learning from them. “Aggression. I like their attitude. Looking at them, even I feel like being aggressive.”
On his own century, Dogra waves it away as nothing. “At this age, I’m very normal about these things. Just the team should win.” He even says rather seriously that he owes the team gratitude for staying patient with his lacklustre scores. “I thank them for supporting me. Koi aur team mein hota toh ab tak out hota,” he says, glad the century helped him pull his weight.
Dogra’s promotion as an ‘outsider’ promoted to captaincy wasn’t without murmurs and controversy. And his lack of runs popped up during the Abdul Samad omission conundrum. But the team topped the group, beating Mumbai and Baroda on the way despite his own scratchy form remaining a worry. “These phases happen in cricket. I stay calm whether I score 0 or 100. Stay in the present. Cricket is played for 5-6 hours, other 18 hours worries you can’t let it drag you down,” he says. “I couldn’t get set because I didn’t spend enough time on the wicket. Little bit of concentration issue.”
While he was being observed for a couple of years as he played for Pondicherry, this season started on a trial basis. “It took time. We started at the Buchi Babu tournament in Chennai. I slowly learnt their nature, decide ki bamboo dena hai or talk nicely,” he laughs. “Pyaar se bolne se kaam ho jaata hai,” he concluded. “They’re really good guys and good listeners. They are mature and responsible.”
Kerala have been digging their heels in with their middle and late order, and are perfectly capable of seeing this through to make the semis. But Dogra has played far too much cricket to know it’s not over till it’s over.
Teammates speak about his calm nature, not prone to anger. He doesn’t fret over the 1-run lead ceded, nor catches dropped. “Ho gayaa woh ho gayaa (What’s done is done). You can’t waste energy on regrets. Even if catches are dropped (Salman Nizar, who helped Kerala get the lead, was dropped too), I tell them it’s dropped by our people only. Happens in cricket,” he says unfrazzled.

Brief scores: J&K 280 & 399/9 declared (Paras Dogra 132, Kanhaiya Wadhawan 64, Sahil Lotra 59; MD Nidheesh 4/89) vs Kerala 281 & 100/2

Title: Sri Lanka’s Dasun Shanaka faces inquiry for leaving club game midway to play for T20 league team in Dubai
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dasun-shanaka-inquiry-leaves-club-game-midway-t20-league-9830614/
Content:
Former Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka will face an inquiry by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) after it surfaced that he left a first-class match before it was completed to play for Dubai Capitals, an International League T20 team in UAE, on February 2. SLC CEO Ashley de Silva told espncricinfo.com that Shanaka’s club Sinhalese Sports Club was also conducting its own inquiry. Match referee was made to believe that Shanaka had suffered a concussion during the game against Moor Sports Club, espncricinfo.com reported.
With SSC battling to avoid relegation, Shanaka was asked to play for the club even as the International League T20 tournament was on. Shanaka made 123 off 87 balls over Day 2 and 3, before leaving before the end of the third day.
He didn’t turn up to bowl when Moor Sports Club was batting but a few hours later on the same day made 34 off just 12 balls for Dubai Capitals.
Shanaka last represented Sri Lanka in mid-2024 and has not found a spot in any format for the national side after that.

Dubai Capitals were eventually crowned champions and after leaving the SSC game, Shanaka played three games for the IL20 team. Shanaka played six Test matches, 71 One-day Internationals and 102 T20 Internationals for Sri Lanka.

Title: ‘When was the last time Afridi delivered a match-winning performance?’: Rashid Latif slams Pakistan pace attack
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rashid-latif-slams-shaheen-afridi-naseem-shah-pak-pace-attack-9830578/
Content:
Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said that Pakistan should look beyond pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, urging the Pakistan cricket Board to overhaul the team’s pace attack. Lalif said that he does not feel that the two frontline pacers, who were in Pakistan’s Champions Trophy squad, were not contributing enough to the team.
“When was the last time Afridi delivered a match-winning performance?” Latif said. “Naseem has also not contributed significantly to Pakistan’s success,” the former wicketkeeper-batsman added in an interview with a channel as per PTI.
Lalif also brought up Pakistan’s recent defeat against New Zealand in the ongoing Tri-Series opener, saying that it was an example of how the pacers have not made an impact in recent times.
“I have concerns over the form of Shaheen, Naseem and others and I feel they have not performed as expected,” he said.
Latif also felt that players like Khushdil Shah and Salman Agha are frequently criticised, while senior players like Afridi, Babar Azam, and Muhammad Rizwan rarely face scrutiny for their performances.
“No one is talking about these players’ lacklustre performances,” Latif said.
Pakistan will next take on South Africa in the 3rd match of the Tri-Series to book a place in the final against New Zealand on February 14.
Last month, Pakistan had unveiled the squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy. The team will be skippered by Mohammad Rizwan with Salman Ali Agha as the vice-captain. It also has three members from the 2017 Champions Trophy winning side in Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf and Fakhar Zaman.

Pakistan made four changes in the 15-player squad which had last played an ODI series in South Africa late last year with Abdullah Shafique, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Saim Ayub and Sufyan Moqim getting replaced by Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khushdil Shah and Saud Shakeel.

Title: Saurashtra batting stalwart Sheldon Jackson retires from first-class cricket after 15-year career
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sheldon-jackson-retires-saurashtra-15-year-career-9830564/
Content:
Prolific Saurashtra batter Sheldon Jackson on Tuesday retired from professional cricket after a career spanning 15 years, his last outing ending in a defeat to Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal here.
Jackson, 38, retires with more than 7200 runs in 105 first-class matches with a highest score of 186, 21 hundreds and 39 half-centuries.
That he ended his career with an average of over 45 speaks volumes about his consistency in first-class cricket.
Jackson has been a multidimensional cricketer and besides being a reliable batsman and an excellent fielder. He also kept wickets for Saurashtra in the limited-over competitions.
In the longer format, however, he was not required to do the duty thanks to Sagar Jogiyani’s presence.
He scored 14 and 27 in his final two outings as Gujarat won by an innings and 98 runs.
Jackson, who was once part of the Kolkata Knight Riders set-up after being spotted by former Bengal player Joydeep Mukherjee, made his debut for Saurashtra in December 2011.
After being on the fringes of selection for his state team Saurashtra for three years, he made his debut in December 2011.
He made four fifties and three hundreds in the 2012-13 Ranji season, including back-to-back centuries in the quarter-final and semi-final against Karnataka and Punjab respectively, to help Saurashtra qualify for the final for the first time.
Owing to his excellent run with the bat that year, he broke into the India A team for the series against West Indies A at home. He was also a prominent member in Saurashtra’s second charge towards a Ranji Trophy title in the 2015-16 season.

Last month, Jackson had called time on his limited-overs career after scoring 2792 runs in 84 innings, with his highest being an unbeaten 133 during the Vijay Hazare Trophy in 2022.
In the limited-overs game, he struck nine centuries and 14 half-centuries in all.

Title: India vs England ODI series: In his whirlwind century, Rohit Sharma showed he knows how to construct an innings
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-century-innings-construction-ind-vs-eng-odi-9830516/
Content:
If there was anything to worry about Rohit Sharma the ODI player, it was settled in two shots early on in his innings in the second ODI against England at Cuttack. A flicked six over wide midwicket in the second over off Gus Atkinson and a hit over long-off in the fifth over off Saqib Mahmood.
Rohit owns that shot – the way the hands move through the line, kicking up the imagery of a father lifting his daughter and throwing her up in joy in one swooping fluid motion. In the one Ranji Trophy game he played and was trolled after getting out cheaply in both innings, he had played that straight hit once; perhaps the confidence-revival kickstarted then.
Rohit’s 90-ball 119, including seven sixes, would seem like a whirlwind knock, but a lot of planning went into its construction. “I really broke it down into pieces about how I wanted to bat,” he said after the game. “It’s a 50-over format, a little longer than the T20 format and a lot shorter than Test cricket – but obviously you still need to break it down and assess what you need to do at regular intervals and that is what I kept doing. It was important for a batter who gets set to bat as deep as possible, and that was my focus.”
💬💬 It’s about enjoying. And that is what we play the sport for #TeamIndia Captain Rohit Sharma after scoring his 32nd ODI Century 👌👌

In an earlier world, those words would suggest a 120-ball 80 kind of knock; the acceleration at start, steadying hand in middle overs, and some violence at the end. Now these phases take place within a much shorter time frame; that Rohit didn’t bat even 30 overs says much – the T20 effect.
He was whistling along on 54 from 34 balls, somewhat slowed down to 62 from 45, pressed on the gas again to move to 73 from 48, and once again eased up to 82 from 60 in the phase when Virat Kohli came and went. The skipper dealt in singles again to move to 94 from 75 balls before he pinged the long-off boundary to get to the landmark.
There isn’t much to worry about in white-ball cricket for him, but he is yet to crack the swivelled Nataraja pull shot off the front foot against the new ball; these days the weight transfer happens that bit slower than in the past. Apart from that, there is no real concern for Rohit against the white ball on pitches that are usually provided. When there is lateral movement, his penchant to play the straight lines can get him into trouble as seen in Australia with the rejigged Kookaburra ball that did something extra in the first 30 overs.
Apart from choosing the phases to strike – that depended on the match situation and who was bowling at him – Rohit said he also took one extra precaution. Two actually.

“When you play on a black soil pitch, (the ball) tends to skid on a bit. So, it’s important that you show the full face of the bat.” Then he had anticipated and mentally prepped for the line of attack from England. “They were trying to bowl into the body and not give room, so I prepared my plan as well. I accessed the gaps.”
This is where he used the pull shot, but in a tamed-down gentle and intelligent manner. The intent wasn’t to send the white ball soaring into the stands, but to manoeuvre deliveries angling into his body into the gaps. Like the three shots he unfurled off Atkinson’s four deliveries spread over two overs, the 16th and 18th. The first was lapped around for four, and Rohit was set up to do the same the second time. But the ball was slower and sat up, and so he patted it over fine-leg. He lapped it for the third time into the gap and England were forced to give up the into-the-body attack.
As many as 87 percent of his runs against Atkinson were on the legside, and a lot of them bunched between midwicket and long leg as he responded to the line of attack by “accessing gaps”. Mark Wood varied between back of length and fuller without movement and resultantly, the runs came via cut shots through backward point or majestic biffs to long-on. And he used the sweep frequently against Adil Rashid, picking up 13 runs in the fine-leg region.
During Kohli’s brief innings, Rohit eased up again, taking just three runs in two overs off Jamie Overton, who bowled mostly back of length and around the off-stump. And later, he let Shreyas Iyer do the biffing. The captain bunted Wood and Rashid around, rotating the strike, before he dashed down the pitch to crash-land the ball to long-off for his hundred.
32 ODI tons later, Rohit Sharma is still the man with a plan and a clear mind 🧠

“It was doing the things I do,” Rohit told bcci.tv after the match. “I have been here long enough. Just another day in the office … When you have scored so many runs, you have done something right; you just need to get back to that mindset of how to score runs. Sounds quite simple but it’s quite difficult. In my mind, it’s about enjoying; that’s why we play the sport.”

A Rohit Sharma striving to enjoy the game is good news for India and considering the pall of gloom that surrounded him in Australia, a welcome relief – for him, his fans, and the team.

Title: Graeme Smith feels South Africa are likely to end ICC trophy drought in 2025

When it comes to ICC events, South Africa have always been the proverbial bridesmaids with the Proteas failing to win a major trophy even with world-class talents at their disposal. The latest heartbreak came against India last June when South Africa, who were heading towards a sure-shot victory in the final of the T20 World Cup, unravelled and fell short leading to the Men in Blue ending their own long ICC title drought.
With the Champions Trophy set to begin on February 19, former Proteas skipper Graeme Smith is of the opinion that South Africa will end their prolonged wait for an ICC title by winning the whole thing on March 9. Smith also pointed out that the World Test Championship, which will take place in June this year, is another opportunity for the Proteas to clinch an ICC silverware.
“Hopefully, we will end that wait much before the 2027 World Cup, with the Champions Trophy and WTC final coming up but if South Africa could win a WC trophy in front of a home crowd, it would be amazing,” Smith said to PTI Bhasha.
“Over the next three years, we want to just keep pushing to improve our stadiums, pitches and our cricket ecosystem, so that by the time we host the 2027 WC, we are the favourites,” he added.
With critics saying that South Africa had an easier run to the WTC final, playing teams like West Indies, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Smith rebuffed the claims.

“There is no smooth journey in cricket today. You have got to do what you got to do. Right in the beginning, everyone knew who they were playing and who they were not playing. South Africa has won 7 test matches in a row to qualify. Everyone should look into the Test ecosystem, how it works as you play what you have been told to play in that cycle,” he said.

Marco Jansen, Rassie van der Dussen, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs will all fly to Pakistan after 14th February due to their commitments in the recently-concluded SA20 league. But the Proteas will be bolstered by the fact that Heinrich Klaasen and Keshav Maharaj will be available for selection for the 3rd ODI.

Title: ‘Virat Kohli is still the best player’: Chris Gayle lends support to ex-RCB teammate
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-best-player-world-chris-gayle-rcb-india-9830113/
Content:
West Indies icon Chris Gayle said Virat Kohli remains the best player in the world irrespective of his form. Even though Kohli is on lean patch currently, Gayle said he would still bet on his former Royal Challengers Bengaluru teammate to turn things around eventually.
“He is still the best player in the world regardless of the form, Virat Kohli is still the best player, the stats prove that, how many centuries across formats he has scored as well,” Gayle said on the sidelines of an event on Tuesday.
“It’s just one of those things that we cricketers go through in patches. I know it is coming at the back end of his career as well, but these things do happen, so he just needs to pick himself up and come back again.”
The 36-year-old Kohli has had a dismal last few months, failing to score runs against both New Zealand and Australia in back to back Test series while also failing to find form playing for his state in a Ranji match.
In the ongoing England series, Kohli sat out the first match due to an injury but his much hyped return in the second match at Cuttack also fell flat when he could just score 6 runs.

Asked if Kohli can break Gayle’s record for most number of runs scored in the Champions Trophy, the former West Indies batter said, “It is easy for him just to get 200 runs (more to surpass Gayle). I don’t know how many games they will be playing but I am sure he can get over 200 runs, and I am sure he will get a century for sure, so it’s just a matter of time before he goes on to break that record.”

Title: India vs England 3rd ODI: head-to-head stats, weather update, date, time, squad and other details

Content:
Rohit Sharma-led India will lock horns against England’s Jos Buttler in the final game of the three-match ODI series at the Narendra Modi Cricket Stadium in Ahmedabad. India have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead with identical four-wicket wins in each of the first two ODIs.
Both India and England will be looking to tick their boxed before the Champions Trophy. For India captain Rohit Sharma has found form after scoring a blistering century in the second ODI. The team management will be hoping that Virat Kohli will also be back among the runs before flying to Dubai.
On the other hand, for Jos Butter’s England, this tour has raised more questions than they would have expected. England have suffered repeated implosions in their core batting line-up across the T20Is and ODIs which has undone the impressive work that the opening pair of Phil Salt and Ben Duckett has been putting up.
India predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakarvarthy, Arshdeep Singh
Player to watch out for: Virat Kohli’s form will be in focus in Ahmedabad. Virat Kohli hasn’t looked completely out of touch but hasn’t stayed at the crease for long enough to give himself a chance for a big knock either. If Virat Kohli manages to click, Kohli is in with a chance create another record. He is 89 runs short of becoming only the third batter in history to score 14,000 runs in the format which arguably has been the run-machine’s favourite.
England predicted XI: Ben Duckett, Phil Salt (wk), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (c), Liam Livingstone, Jamie Overton, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood
Player to watch out for: England have suffered repeated implosions in their core batting line-up across the T20Is and ODIs which has undone the impressive work that the opening pair of Phil Salt and Ben Duckett has been putting up. Jo Buttler maintains his team remains a work in progress but exit of the talented Jacob Bethell due to hamstring injury hampers them further. Harry Brook has blown hot and cold in ideal conditions for batting and Joe Root’s impressive returns haven’t got the adequate support from others.
India Squad: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja
England Squad: Harry Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Jos Buttler, Jamie Smith, Philip Salt, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood
Matches played: 109, India won: 60, England won: 44
The Narendra Modi Stadium is known for offering a balanced pitch that provides assistance to both batters and bowlers. The surface generally starts with good bounce and carry, favoring fast bowlers in the initial overs. As the game progresses, the pitch tends to settle down, making batting easier, especially under lights. The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium is expected to be good for batting, with some assistance for pacers early on. Spinners will be crucial in the middle overs, and a first-innings score of 270+ will be competitive.
According to current weather forecasts, the India vs England 3rd ODI at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on February 12, 2025, is expected to have clear skies with no chance of rain. The maximum temperature is predicted to be around 31 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature may drop to 15 degrees in the evening. The humidity level is estimated to be around 38%. Overall, the weather forecast looks promising for a full and uninterrupted cricket match.
The 3rd ODI between India and England will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network. The match will also be available for live streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.

English County Club Surrey which owns the Oval Invincibles in The Hundred has confirmed their partnership with Reliance India Limited (RIL). And Surrey have also said that they will continue to retain 51 per cent of the stake in the franchise, there by retaining control of the team which is the most successful in the tournament.
The Oval Invincibles which was the first team to be sold by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) was valued at £123 million and subsequently RIL bought 49 per cent of the stakes for £60m. And following negotiations between the two, Surrey have released a statement confirming the deal with RIL’s subsidiary RISE Worldwide.
“R1SE will have a 49 per cent share of the Hundred team, with Surrey retaining the majority 51 per cent. The Club hopes to benefit from Mumbai Indians’ vast experience and proven success, fresh off lifting yet another league title in South Africa over the weekend, to further strengthen and maintain the team’s position as the leading franchise in the competition.
Surrey County Cricket Club have today announced that Reliance Industries Limited through its subsidiary, RISE Worldwide, is the club’s preferred partner for The Hundred team when its ownership transfers from ECB to Surrey CCC at the end of 2025.

Though some of the other counties have been ready to sell their percentage of stake in The Hundred, Surrey have been keen on retaining the 51 per cent stake they have had on the Oval Invincibles. Speaking of the partnership with RISE, Surrey said, “Over 17 years, the dedication of the MI family has resulted in 11 league titles across the globe, including five IPL championships, two Champions League victories, and the inaugural WPL and Major League Cricket titles in 2023, ILT20 in 2024 and SA20 in 2025. Every team in the MI Family now has a winner’s trophy.
Akash Ambani, the owner of Mumbai Indians said, “We are glad to be part of Oval Invincibles—the most successful teams in The Hundred—and welcome them into the Mumbai Indians family. England, with its rich cricketing culture, has always been special to the game. To have the iconic Oval, which has witnessed some of cricket’s greatest moments, as our home venue is truly special. We look forward to collaborating with like-minded partners, Surrey CCC, who share our passion and ethos for the sport. By leveraging our global cricket expertise, we aim to further elevate the teams, engage with fans, and expand our footprint in the sport we love.”

Title: Was relieved to be back at KKR as I didn’t want to play for any other team, says Vaibhav Arora
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/was-relieved-to-be-back-at-kkr-as-i-didnt-want-to-play-for-any-other-team-says-vaibhav-arora-9829622/
Content:
Pacer Vaibhav Arora who had a breakthrough season with Kolkata Knight Riders last season, picking up 11 wickets in their title winning campaign has said he is working on improving his death bowling skills.
In KKR’s outstanding run, Arora was one of the finds of the season with his strikes in the powerplay being much talked about. With a natural ability to swing the new ball, KKR used him to good effect in the powerplay which allowed them to save the likes of Harshit Rana and Mitchell Starc for the death overs.
And Arora said, he has been working on his death bowling skills with the next edition of the IPL around the corner. “I did well in the powerplay in 2024, and I’ll take confidence from that. However, I have worked on my death bowling, and I want to be as effective as possible even at that stage of the game. I’ve focused on my slower ones, yorkers and other variations even in red ball cricket. I’ll try to bring that same execution to white ball cricket to try and do well at any stage of the game”, he added.
Arora said he has been working with KKR bowling coach Bharat Arun in this regard. Crediting his coach’s impact, he said, “I’ve worked with Bharat sir in the last couple of years, this will be the third year. The way he shares his experiences and learnings has helped me become a better bowler each year. So hopefully, I’ll do even better under his guidance this year and try to make the team win.”
Since the last IPL, he has seen his teammate Harshit Rana take rapid strides and become a part of India’s pace pack. After making his Test debut in Australia, Rana also featured in the ODIs against England. And Arora said he is looking forward to reunite with Rana at KKR. “This is our third year together. We didn’t get a chance to play together initially but when we did, we had done well for the team. Even last year when we won the trophy, as a partnership, we worked well together from both ends. When you’re bowling in partnerships, there’s a different relation you create off the field as well. This year he was retained, and I was bought in the auction. It feels like the brothers have reunited again.”
Arora said was excited to wear the Purple and Gold again, after the franchise bought him at the auction for Rs 1.80 crore. “It was special to be back with KKR. I’ve been with the Knight Riders since the last four seasons and there is an emotional attachment with the franchise. It feels like my own family. So, when KKR picked me again, I was relieved to go back to the team I won the title with last year. I didn’t want to play for any other team”, he stated.

Title: Kris Srikkanth on KL Rahul batting at No 6: ‘Hey Gambhir, what you are doing is not right’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/kris-srikkanth-on-kl-rahul-batting-at-no-6-hey-gambhir-what-you-are-doing-is-not-right-9829566/
Content:
Former India captain K Srikkanth has criticised head coach Gautam Gambhir for the decision to slot KL Rahul at No 6 in the ongoing ODIs against England. In both the matches so far, with India preferring to have left-right combination in the middle, Rahul has been demoted to No 6, one position lower than he usually bats in the ODIs with Axar Patel coming in at No 5.
Srikkanth who has previously been the chairman of selectors called the move unfair on Rahul, especially since he had been the best performing player at No 5 over the past couple of years. “Shreyas Iyer is in good form, which is a positive for India. But I feel for KL Rahul, it’s very unfortunate. Yes, Axar Patel is scoring 30s and 40s, but what they are doing with KL Rahul is not fair. Look at his record, he has excelled at No. 5, with a brilliant record. I don’t know what the team management is thinking regarding his position. If he bats at No. 6 or 7, he ends up scoring 6 or 7. It’s unfair,” Srikkanth said on his YouTube Channel.
Axar who walked in to bat at No 5 in the two ODIs has justified the promotion scoring 52 and 41. However, Rahul has made 2 and 10. And speaking of the left-right combination Srikkanth said this flexibility could come back to bite India.
“”Hey, Gambhir, what you are doing is not right. Yes, depending on the situation, India can send Axar at No. 5, but it cannot be a consistent strategy. If you keep making such changes, you know what will happen — there will be a crucial match where everything falls apart. That’s what worries me. You can’t justify it by talking about the left-right combination. Does that mean you don’t care about a left-right combination in the top four? Why does it only matter at No. 5?” he added.
Srikkant said if the team management prefers a left-hander, then it should include Rishabh Pant in the XI as he is best equipped to bat at No 6. “I have no issue with Axar Patel—he is making the most of his chances. But if you’re pushing Rahul down the order, then play Rishabh Pant at No. 6. Why undermine Rahul’s confidence? Is it fair to a player who has performed brilliantly in world cricket?” he added.
Given the low scores, Srikkanth said there is a strong chance that Rahul could up warming the bench at the Champions Trophy. “Now, what you’ve done is you’ve sidelined Rishabh Pant as well. One of them has to play. I have a feeling Pant will feature in the third ODI and then in the Champions Trophy too. Rahul might end up warming the bench again,” he added.
“You should play your best player at No. 5, regardless of whether he is left-handed or right-handed,” he added.

Title: Zaheer Khan says Gautam Gambhir’s ‘excessive flexible approach’ can create insecurity in India’s white-ball set-up
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/zaheer-khangautam-gambhir-flexible-approach-insecurity-india-white-ball-9829457/
Content:
Former India pacer Zaheer Khan has expressed concern over Team India’s coach Gautam Gambhir’s “excessive flexible approach” in the white-ball set up and says the constant chopping and change can create an insecurity within the players.
Zaheer says having flexibility is good but it must come with clear guidelines to ensure stability within the squad.
“You’ve said that you’ve got to have flexibility. Number one and two will be there, but the others are going to be flexible. Within that flexibility, some rules also apply. There are certain protocols you have to follow. Certain communication needs to happen, which is going to streamline things,” Zaheer said on Cricbuzz.
“Otherwise, you are creating insecurity, which at some stage will come back and hurt you. You don’t want it to be the case. So you’ve got to be prepared to deal with that situation.”
Zaheer Khan also said the entire system needs to be streamlined for the wheel to turn properly.
“That’s why I said recency bias is something very string right now,” he said.
“The situation has become dynamic if you have to compare Rahul Dravid’s approach and Gautam Gambhir’s approach. You can say it’s good, bad, or ugly or you can say how do we adapt?
“Each individual is a part of this system, be it the senior management or the think tank, be it the players, be it the selectors. They will have to gauge it and the entire system needs to be streamlined for the wheel to turn properly,” he added.
India have won the T20I series against England comprehensively by 4-1 and are leading the three-match ODI series by 2-0. The last match of the seirs will be played on Wednesday at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Title: Jasprit Bumrah’s absence from Champions Trophy will be like Cristiano Ronaldo not playing in football World Cup: Steve Harminson
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/jasprit-bumrah-champions-trophy-cristiano-ronaldo-football-world-cup-steve-harmison-9829366/
Content:
Former England pacer Steve Harminson has compared Jasprit Bumrah to Cristiano Ronaldo. Harminson says if Bumrah will not play in the Champions Trophy, it will be like football World Cup without Cristiano Ronaldo.
Last month, the Indian Express has reported that India’s strike bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who has swelling on his back,  is likely to miss the group stage of next month’s Champions Trophy due to a swelling on his back.
“He’s Jasprit Bumrah. For me, you can’t replace Jasprit Bumrah anytime,” Harminson said on TalkSport cricket.
“And I mean, I would even go up to the morning of the final to take him that far because he’s Jasprit Bumrah.
“He’s the best in the world. So that would be my take on from an Indian point of view.
“It’s like going to a football World Cup with your best striker, Cristiano Ronaldo. 15 years ago you don’t replace Ronaldo until you have to replace him. So I think I would imagine that’s what India will do.
“Just put him in the squad and carry him around in a sedan chair. It’s a 14-man squad. That’s good enough to get me through the group games.
“We might get him by semifinal, more than the semifinal. If he’s not fit, we’ll replace him just in case we have another injury. But he’s Jasprit Bumrah.”
The Champions Trophy, which will have the world’s top eight ODI teams, begins on February 19, with the matches scheduled at Karachi, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Dubai for India’s games.
While India’s last group match, against New Zealand, is on March 2, it is unclear if Bumrah will be ready to play. Prior to this, India will play Bangladesh on February 20 and Pakistan on February 23. India will play all their matches in Dubai, as the team refused to travel to Pakistan citing security concerns and the ICC agreed to a hybrid model. The semi-finals are on March 4 and 5, and the final on March 9.
In the recent five-match Test series in Australia, Bumrah took 32 wickets and won the player of the series award. He sat out on the final day of the series in Sydney because of his injury. Australia won the series and took the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.
Bumrah has had issues with his back earlier too. He missed nearly 11 months of cricket — from September 2022 to August 2023 — after undergoing a surgery.

Title: Urvil Patel now scores a Ranji Trophy ton, after his fastest Indian T20 century
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/urvil-patel-scores-ranji-trophy-ton-after-fastest-indian-t20-century-9828875/
Content:
This has been a record-making season for Gujarat’s Urvil Patel. Having picked up cricket in Palanpur, a city that is synonymous with diamonds, the 26-year-old is beginning to show why he must be the most polished gem to emerge out of the town. In this season’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he smashed the fastest-ever T20 century by an Indian off 28 deliveries, which is the second fastest in the world too. In last season’s Vijay Hazare Trophy, he hit a 41-ball hundred, the second quickest by an Indian. On Monday, it was time to get down to the record books again as his maiden first-class century (140 off 197) against Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy made him only the second player after Shreyas Iyer to score a century in all three formats of a single domestic season.
When the third day’s play began in Rajkot with Gujarat having a lead of 44 runs, Saurashtra knew they had to dislodge Urvil — who was 29 overnight – as early as possible. The situation seemed tailor made for Urvil to unleash his aggressive game. He has been playing domestic T20s and List A since 2018 – starting with Baroda before switching to Gujarat — but the Ranji debut came only last season, and it is this ongoing season where he started as a first-choice. But there was something else that Urvil wanted to get used to.
“My game is more suited for white-ball,” Urvil concedes. “But I wanted to feel the red-ball game as well because the satisfaction of scoring big in Ranji Trophy is different. What I wanted to experience was when you have to take less risk, why is it hard to bat long. So I was just trying to play a long innings and see how I go about it. Plus, the match situation was such that, it needed me to go out and play a big knock which I did,” Urvil tells The Indian Express.
Urvil of course had to thank fellow centurion Jaymeet Patel (103) and Manan Hingrajia (83) who had done all the hard work on Day 2 to blunt Saurashtra’s attack. And having taken the first innings lead, Gujarat needed Urvil to drive home the advantage. “Playing attacking cricket comes naturally to me. However since we had to switch between formats, I had to learn how to adjust between the three. And just because I’m playing red-ball cricket, there is no need to change my game drastically. It was more about learning to apply myself for longer periods. Since I’m taking less risks, I knew runs would definitely come,” Urvil adds.
In the SMAT he scored 315 runs in 6 matches including two centuries with his strike-rate of 229.92 being the best for any. That it came opening the innings showed the impact he has been having on the side and it continued in Vijay Hazare Trophy as well, scoring 333 at a strike-rate of 134.27. “My game is more suited to white-ball. When you are opening, you have the licence to play freely. And as a batsman, you ought to put less price on your wicket and play high-risk cricket. I feel that comes naturally to me and liberates my game as well. My intention has always been about going on the attack,” Urvil says.
Given his big-hitting prowess it did come as a surprise that his name didn’t even come up at the IPL auctions. In 2023 he had been part of the Gujarat Titans franchise, but this time even his name failed to make the cut. “I can’t blame anyone because I scored all of it after the auction. But there is always time… there is no point thinking about what you missed, when you have a whole domestic season ahead of you. I’ve lot to work on my batting,” Urvil adds.
It has been quite a remarkable journey for Urvil who picked up the cricket bat only because his father Mukesh Patel, a physical education teacher at Government school, couldn’t fulfil his dreams of becoming an athlete. So when Urvil was born, he wanted to make him a cricketer. “Back then, my father couldn’t go beyond the state level. He was a sprinter – participated at 200m and 400m at state level meets. But since ours was a huge joint family he had to cut short his dream and start working. For me, he has been a huge pillar of support because he has ensured that I get everything. He even left his tuition classes to help me with training.”
Having made heads turn, Urvil knows an IPL call-up should be around the corner, but it isn’t the destination he sees himself in. Having grown up idolising Hardik Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav, his dream remains earning the India cap. “I really want to be part of India’s T20 side. Just looking at how they are playing, I feel it just suits my style. I’ve had the chance to speak to Hardik bhaiya… and he was also telling me how a batsman should approach a T20 game. That’s what I’m doing these days,” Urvil adds.
Saurashtra 216 & 33/0 vs Gujarat 511 (Urvil Patel 140, Jaymeet Patel 103, Ravi Bishnoi 45; Dharmendrasinh Jadeja 5/120, Chirag Jani 4/67).

Title: Ranji Trophy: Salman Nizar hits ton as last-wicket pair adds 81 to give Kerala 1-run lead over J&K
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-salman-nizar-hits-ton-kerala-1-run-lead-over-jk-9828866/
Content:
Kerala started the third day at 200/9, 80 behind Jammu and Kashmir’s first innings score. Salman Nizar, coming in at No.6 , was batting on 49 with only No.11 Basil Thampi for company. But they pulled a rabbit out the hat, as the last-wicket partnership took Kerala to 281, giving them a cheeky 1-run lead, and 1000 watts worth of confidence.
Despite Nizar’s ton (112 not out), the match is still wide open, with J&K batting on 180/3 in their second innings. But having had Kerala under the pump at one stage, they knew they had let an opportunity go by. Nizar, nicknamed ‘Bakki’, and Thampi barely gave them a chance though, such was the positivity and freedom in their batting in the moving day’s morning session.
Salman comes from Thalassery – that Keralites call the second mecca of cricket, because Colin Cowdrey’s father came down from the Nilgiris to play a spot of cricket there in the 1930s and the game set roots. Besides cricket, the city is also known as the birthplace of India’s grandest circuses – Jumbo, Gemini, Great Bombay, Rajkamal and Amar.
But just like Killeri Kunjikannan, the father of modern Indian circus who brought acrobatics into limelight in India, Nizar did Thalassery proud with his elastic strokemaking, digging out yorkers and redirecting them when imbalanced, and throwing himself at the ball almost for a completely gymnastic innings, comprising 12 boundaries and four sixes.
J&K has some serious pacers and probing spinners. But Nizar heeded to neither, his shots coming square of the wicket including an audacious six over covers. He had been the junior partner in four previous partnerships, but with Thampi assuring him he’d linger, and taking inspiration from Jalaj Saxena’s momentum-changing inning of 67, Bakki contributed 63 (97) to the 10th wicket partnership of 81 (132 balls). The No.11 made 15 off 35.
Besides cricket, circus and cakes, Thalassery is known for its famous biryani, flavoured with cardamom and cloves. But what packs in the punch is the underrated short-grained ‘Khaima’ rice. Nizar is a pocket-sized dynamite too. “I love cricket, I find happiness in teammates playing in the IPL,” he says, not wanting to complain on the big day about the disproportionate efforts and rewards of two formats.
His belief comes from coach Amey Khurasiya. “The coach gave me strong belief and said we can do miracles if we believe,” he says. The method came from Saxena. “I thought if he can play shots, we can too. That’s the way to play. Positive. He said if the ball is short from spinners, go for shots for you can clear the boundary easily. And to avoid the drive.”
Complete team man
Nizar knew Thampi had scored a 50 at Lahli, and trusted him to hold his own. He had missed a century earlier in the Ranji season, batting at No.8, when the team declared their first innings at 356/9 with him batting on 95 off 262 balls. The Bengali press pack at Jadavpur University would’ve praised a probable rearguard century. Opening-round headlines would’ve been glowing. It would’ve ended an eight-year wait for the three-figure milestone. But it was not to be back in October.
Salman, who debuted a decade ago in first-class cricket but has played fewer than 30 matches for Kerala, however, walked away calmly when the captain declared that day. “8-9 years, no century,” he recalls. But ask him about ‘that declaration’ and he wastes not a second in declaring, “It was a team decision to declare (after 120 overs), and I truly agreed. Ranji cricket is not about personal milestones. It was good for the team,” he says.
It’s a peek into ‘Selfless Salman’ – the quintessential Kerala team man, the likes of whom the team has been relying on this inspiring season. He would go on to get his first century in nine seasons of plodding against Bihar. It was a 150, rescuing Kerala from 81/4 and giving them a priceless outright win.
At the MCA Stadium on Monday morning, the 27-year-old got the entire team to rise and applaud a century that gave Kerala cricket itself the sort of self-assurance that deflates opponents.
“I had a few 40-50s that were good for the team. But I wasn’t happy I wasn’t converting. This season I got both,” Nizar says.
Born into a religiously strict family, he followed his brother into cricket and refused to give up the game and follow him to Dubai when runs went fallow. “I was at the Kochi academy for 9 years,” he recalls.
When J&K were reduced to 78/3, thanks to MD Nidheesh and Nedumankuzhy Basil, Kerala seemed to have things going their way. But that’s when skipper Paras Dogra (73 batting) and Kanhaiya Wadhawan (42 batting) came to their team’s rescue with an unbroken 102-run partnership that took J&K’s lead to 179.
With two days left in the quarterfinal, both teams will fancy their chances, but Nizar has assured that it will be Kerala who would be left smiling even if there’s no outright result from this game. A Ranji Trophy semifinal is a rare achievement for the state.
Jammu and Kashmir 280 & 180/3 (Paras Dogra 73 batting) lead Kerala 281 (Salman Nizar 112 not out, Jalaj Saxena 67; Auqib Nabi 6/53) by 179 runs

Title: Ranji Trophy: Shardul Thakur the hero again as Mumbai take control
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-shardul-thakur-the-hero-again-as-mumbai-take-control-9828757/
Content:
On Day 3, often called the moving day, the script unravelled quickly as Mumbai, Vidarbha and Gujarat took control of their quarterfinal fixtures at Kolkata, Nagpur and Rajkot respectively. At Pune, Jammu & Kashmir and Kerala are setting up an exciting finish. Here is the round-up of the matches…
Since the last Ranji season, Shardul Thakur has been Mumbai’s most valuable player. And after showing his all-round utility in the last two rounds, he once again delivered when it mattered the most. On the third morning, with Haryana within touching distance of a first innings lead that could provide a psychological advantage, Thakur took it upon himself to land the telling blows.
When play resumed on Monday, Haryana had five wickets in hand and were just 52 runs away from overhauling Mumbai’s first innings total of 315. However, Thakur ran through them to end up with six wickets in the innings as Haryana were bowled out for 301, losing their last five wickets for just 38 runs. Barring captain Ankit Kumar who made 136 at the top, none of them crossed 36.
From there on, Mumbai began to assert control over the game. All that they needed was a good start and once their top three provided it, captain Ajinkya Rahane and Suryakumar Yadav did the rest. With Rahane dropping anchor, Surya took the attack to the opposition, scoring 70 off 86 deliveries. Rahane looked solid, remaining unbeaten at stumps on 88 as Mumbai’s lead swelled to 292 with six wickets in hand. With plenty of batting to come, they may already have one foot in the semifinals.
Brief scores: Mumbai 315 & 278/4 (Ajinkyar Rahane 88 batting, Suryakumar Yadav 70) vs Haryana 301 (Ankit Kumar 136; Shardul Thakur 6/58).
The writing is on the wall for Tamil Nadu as they begin to endure a slow and painful exit from the Ranji Trophy, to extend their title drought in the tournament. Beginning the day at 159/6 in response to Vidarbha’s 353, they folded for 225 to concede a lead of 128 as seamer Aditya Thakare finished with five wickets. From there on, for Tamil Nadu to make a match of it, they needed their bowlers to make quick inroads into an in-form batting line-up. Though Vidarbha lost their first three wickets in quick succession, Yash Rathod held fort at one end. With time not being a constraint, Vidarbha went about their business patiently, thereby ensuring their bowlers too got enough time to recover, ending Day 3 at 169/5 with a lead of 297 runs.
Brief scores: Vidarbha 353 & 169/5 (Yash Rathod 55 batting) vs Tamil Nadu 225 (Andre Siddarth 65, Pradosh Ranjan Paul 48; Aditya Thakare 5/34).
At Rajkot, it feels like an era is coming to an end as Saurashtra ended the third day at 33/0 in their second innings trailing Gujarat by a massive 262 runs. One of the most consistent sides over the last decade, with ageing players around, the end cards are beginning to be played for Saurashtra. When play resumed on Monday, Gujarat already had a lead of 44 runs. Overnight batsman Jaymeet Patel completed his century before falling for 103. Thereafter, wicketkeeper Urvil Patel, who has been in red-hot form this season across all formats, went about punishing Saurashtra. In an innings of 197 deliveries, Urvil scored 140 (17x4s, 4x6s) as the lower order provided him ample support. Gujarat ended with 511 on the board. For Saurashtra, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja picked up five wickets while Chirag Jani took four. With two days left in the game, Saurashtra’s Ranji season is all set to end in the quarterfinals for the second successive season.
Brief scores: Saurashtra 216 & 33/0 vs Gujarat 511 (Urvil Patel 140, Jaymeet Patel 103; Dharmendrasinh Jadeja 5/120, Chirag Jani 4/67).

Title: Why Hardik Pandya is Team India’s MVP for ICC Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/why-hardik-pandya-is-team-indias-mvp-for-icc-champions-trophy-9828698/
Content:
When Hardik Pandya went down twisting his ankle three balls into his opening spell at the MCA Stadium in Pune mid-way through the ODI World Cup in 2023, captain Rohit Sharma and India were forced to rethink their strategies and shed a few inhibitions.
Mohammad Shami dropped in as the new first-change pacer behind Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, shortening the team’s batting depth. Shami would go on a tear with 24 wickets, including three five-wicket hauls and a sparkling 7/57 in the semi-final against New Zealand. Pandya was not missed with the ball as a menacing seam trio was formed. With Rohit, Virat Kohli, and other top-order bats in great spirits, the finishers weren’t in great demand either, until everything came crashing down in the final against Australia.
On Sunday, playing in only his second ODI since that fateful hot afternoon in Gahunje, Pandya went down again in the first over of another bowling spell at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack, pained by a sloppy effort on the ball. The expectant Cuttack crowd, witnessing a 50-over game for the first time since 2019, was stubbed to early silence by the English openers. Ben Duckett and Phil Salt had pocketed seven boundaries in the first five overs as Mohammed Shami and Harshit Rana continually erred by offering length deliveries outside the wickets channel.
While Shami was more erratic with his lines to southpaw Duckett from round the stumps, Rana’s short balls failed to extract a threatening lift. Rohit turned to Pandya in the sixth over and the all-rounder nearly struck instantly with ploys dipped in aggression.
Placing a deep backward point fielder within the Powerplay, Pandya wanted the openers to have their fun square off the wicket. While Duckett nailed a square cut for four, Pandya had almost hooked Salt into the trap with a wide bumper outside the off-stump. Salt’s mistimed slash off the rising delivery parried straight to Axar Patel at the deep backward fence but a languid effort would deprive India and Hardik of an early breakthrough. Pandya would sink to his knees in disbelief before extending a smile and an arm of understanding to his statemate Axar.
Deliveries kissing the wide tramline outside the off-stump can be sinful when bowlers, lacking nous and fortitude, operate on it. Not for Pandya, whose tremendous 2024 redemption arc, has offered India an indispensable all-rounder who exudes confidence in both departments. Mastering variations on this tramline channel, Pandya had memorably lit up India’s epochal T20 World Cup final comeback last year in Barbados.
A wafting length off-cutter plugged a buccaneering Heinrich Klaasen caught-behind before a nerveless Pandya would stand ground and seal a title-winning final over shortly thereafter. It was not a random drop on the roulette when all hope seemed to have faded. Thinking on his feet under mind-numbing pressure, Pandya had outthought South Africa’s most menacing bat.
“Just before the ball, I just told him (Rohit) that I’m gonna go wide to Klaasen and I just knew that he’s gonna expect a ball which is on the stumps. His leg was a little to the leg side, so I knew that he was going to try and hit me there and that’s when I, just before my run-up, just looked at him and said I’m going to go slow because I didn’t set a field for a slower ball. I had to outfox him or I had to be a little one up in the game so he’s not aware of what ball is coming, because the way he was hitting it was just tremendous. That just opened the door for us,” Pandya recalled in a recent video shared by the ICC.
Pandya’s expanding bowling arsenal and bowling smarts have seen him develop the temper to operate in all phases with the white ball in both formats. During the recent five T20Is against England, Pandya was a seam constant as India deployed three spinners and a rotational front-line pacer in Arshdeep Singh and Shami. In the 50-over Vijay Hazare Trophy group stages last December, Pandya manned the new ball for Baroda in each of the three games he played in with his developing swing-bowling prowess.
In the two ODI this series, the 31-year-old has returned his old middle-overs and death utilities while also fronting up with the new ball, offering cushion to his seam partners. With uncertainty looming over Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness, nine days out from India’s Champions Trophy opener, the strategic forecast predicts a fallback to India’s original ‘23 WC plan where Pandya steps in as the third pacer.
A three-pronged spin attack headlined by all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel commend a better balance, but Pandya will remain integral to the overall bowling combination too. Batting at 7 in both matches this series, one can assume that the Baroda all-rounder has a greater purpose with the ball behind Shami and the second quick. The scars of ‘23 and the highs of ‘24 have cast him battle-ready for the 50-over task this year.

Title: Ex-Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga says his 1996 team would beat this Indian team, in India
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/arjuna-ranatunga-1996-sri-lanka-team-would-beat-this-indian-team-9828617/
Content:
Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga criticised current cricket players lacking essential skills and blamed franchises for the international game suffering. Ranatunga elaborated on his argument by saying that his 1996 Lankan team would easily defeat the current Indian team in India. “When I was captaining in the early 90s, you look at that batting order as a player… Gavaskar, Vengsarkar, Amarnath. We couldn’t get them out twice…Azharuddin, Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli, Dravid follow­ed. What quality players they were. I’ll ask you a question. Don’t get me wrong. Do we have that class in India now? I don’t think so. I’m blunt. I’ll tell you to the face. If I have this Indian side play against my ’96 side, I’ll get them out twice. I’ll beat India in India,” Ranatunga said to the Telegraph.
Comparing Indian and Sri Lankan cricketers facing the same issue of not being able to create cricketers who could play ‘proper cricket’, Ranatunga said that the value of playing for one’s country was diminishing enough now that its role would cease to exist in the future and franchise cricket would be the only remaining avenue for the game. The ex-Lankan skipper also said that Test cricket required ‘quality, technique and brains’.
“Are we teaching our you­nger guys proper cricket? Can India produce Gavaskars, Vengsarkars, Amarnaths? Maybe Tendulkars, Dravids? Tell you honestly, I have my doubts now. We Sri Lankans have the same problem. I’m glad the present guys are getting good money. You’re looking at franchise cricket. The players are allowed to play franchise cricket without playing for your country… You will agree with me in another five years. Ultimately, the value of playing for your country will be gone. In another five years, they will play (only) franchise cricket.”

Title: ICC Champions Trophy: Fakhar Zaman reveals what coach Mickey Arthur told him before 2017 final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-fakhar-zaman-mickey-arthur-said-2017-final-9828555/

With less than ten days to go for the 2025 Champions Trophy to be played in Pakistan and Dubai, hosts Pakistan under skipper Mohammad Rizwan would be hoping to win the trophy, which they won in the tournament’s last edition in 2017. Banking on a hundred by opener Fakhar Zaman, Pakistan had scored a ten-wicket win over India to register their third win against India in Champions Trophy to win the title in England. 34-year-old Zaman has made a comeback to the Pakistan team for the 2025 Champions Trophy and the opener, who has amassed 3576 runs in 83 ODIs in his career, has shared how he almost missed the final.
“I was not well the day before the game. I even talked to Mickey (Mickey Arthur) and said I won’t be able to play the game. He said you go out there and get a duck first ball, it doesn’t matter, you have to play that game. I managed to play but I remember that I didn’t sleep well that night and he forced me to play. I’m pleased he did!” Zaman told the International Cricket Council (ICC) website.
While India skipper Virat Kohli had won the toss and elected to bowl first at a packed Oval on June 19, 2017, Pakistan openers Fakhar Zaman and Azhar Ali added 128 runs for the first wicket. Zaman, who went in to play a knock of 114 runs off 106 balls in Pakistan’s total of 338 for 4 in the allotted 50 over, Zaman gave an easy catch to Indian wicket-keeper MS Dhoni off a Jasprit Bumrah delivery followed by umpire Kumar Dharmasena calling it a no-ball. It means that Zaman went on to score 101 more runs in the match with Pakistan eventually winning the match by 180 runs. “I had been talking to Shadab (Khan) and somebody got out on a no-ball when we were watching a game. I said ‘I’d love to get out to a no-ball’. I just said it randomly because whenever you get out, I always look to the umpire hoping they will say ‘wait while we check the no-ball’ and nothing happens and I end up back in the dressing room. The same thing happened in that game, I got out to a no-ball. Kumar Dharmasena was the third umpire and I was going out. From the boundary, he said ‘wait there’. I was halfway back and when I saw that, I was 100% sure it was a no-ball. After that, I thought maybe it’s my day,” recalled Zaman.
Zaman, who made a comeback to the Pakistan team for the tri-nation series and Champions Trophy, had last played an ODI for Pakistan in 2023 World Cup before he played against in the first match of the tri-nation series last week. Zaman remembered how the Champions Trophy win in 2017 was special for the whole country. “It was special back in Pakistan. I didn’t expect anything like that and I have never seen anything like that in my whole life. For many weeks, people from 500km or more away would come to take a picture. It was unbelievable and it was something special. The way we made people at that time, I wish I could do more things like that,” said Zaman.

Title: IND vs ENG: Sunil Gavaskar wants ex-players like Rahul Dravid, Ricky Ponting in MCC panel that makes rules
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-sunil-gavaskar-wants-rahul-dravid-ricky-ponting-mcc-panel-9828480/

While India scored a four-wicket win over England in the second ODI at Cuttack riding high on captain Rohit Sharma 90-ball knock of 119 runs, Sharma’s dismissal has once again brought back discussion on a rule change on non-striker not being on strike if the two batsmen crossed ends by cricket’s rules body Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). After Sharma’s dismissal against Liam Livingstone in the 30th over during India’s innings, Sharma and non-striker Shreyas Iyer had crossed when Adil Rashid took the catch but the rule, which was changed in 2022, meant that new batsman Axar Patel took the strike. Former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar believes that former players like Rahul Dravid and others should be in the MCC’ rules committee.
“The laws are changed by MCC. At the moment, the laws are with the MCC. It’s a private club that makes the laws of international games all over the world. And I do believe that there should be some international experience there. Maybe some former captains should be there. Just giving a few names. Graeme Smith, Rahul Dravid – somebody who’s been a recent coach. Ricky Ponting has been around. These are the people who I believe should be in that laws committee. You need playing experience over there and the committee that is there, I am not too sure there is international experience,” Gavaskar said on Star Sports.
Prior to 2022, a non-striker was able to take up the strike after a batsman was dismissed following a catch and the two batsmen had crossed ends. But with the new rule in March 2022, cricket sees the new batsman taking up the strike in the similar scenario. When Patel took the strike after Sharma’s dismissal, Patel faced the remaining two deliveries of the over with Shreyas Iyer on the  other end and India needing 85 runs from 20 overs. Gavaskar opined that the other rules changes like two bouncers in an over or other rules had reasons behind it. But he sees no reason behind this rule change.
“There’s umpiring experience, Yes. Simon Taufel is there. But for any law to change, there needs to be some background. Like the playing conditions came in for two bouncers in an over, one bouncer in an over, or 90 overs in a day, there were reasons behind it. I don’t know whether there was a reason to change this law so that the non-striker would no longer be on strike if the players crossed ends and the batter who played the ball was out caught. I just think that was such an important television aspect too,” Gavaskar further added.

Title: India vs England: What Kevin Pietersen wants Shubman Gill to do after India vice captain’s half century

While Indian captain Rohit Sharma was the top scorer for India with a 99-ball knock of 119 runs during India’s four-wicket win over England in the second ODI against England at Cuttack on Sunday, vice-captain Shubman Gill hit the 15th half-century of his ODI career with a 52-ball knock of 60 runs. It was Gill’s second half-century of the series and it also meant that the 25-year old now has six half-centuries in his last 14 ODI innings. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes that the youngster will now want to keep improving further in his career.
“What makes him even more intimidating to bowl to, is his ability to just play that pickup shot, that little punch shot off the back foot, because a bowler can’t just hover short of a length. What he’s is get a full attack at the top of the stumps or his bouncer has to be very, very good. So, he’s improved this game. He will want to keep improving, he will want to stop getting 60 and getting out. He will want to get the 100 like Rohit,” Pietersen said on Star Sports.
Gill’s last hundred came in September 2023 during the second ODI against Australia ahead of the ICC World Cup in India. In the World Cup, Gill amassed 354 runs in nine innings at an average of 44.25 with a best score of 92 runs. Since that, Gill has played in five ODIs with an average series against Sri Lanka last year. Gill, who has a career ODI average of 58.92 with a. total of 2475 runs in 49 ODIs, faced England bowlers Gus Atkinson and Saqib Mahmood with ease and Pietersen believes that bowlers will face challenges while bowling against Gill.
“I talked about a trigger when you get into big boy’s cricket and you face the faster bowlers. You need a set yourself and it’s a start that he’s now started to take when he’s been batting. I think that it’s improved the way that he’s played. I think it’s improved him as a player, and it’s calmed him down because it’s given him a little bit more time. So the technical change in that adjustment that Shubman Gill’s made has made him into a quality player,” shared the former England cricketer.

South Africa opener Matthew Breetzke became the first batter to score 150 runs on men’s ODI debut in the tri-series match against New Zealand at newly renovated Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The 26-year-old broke the 47-year-old record held by West Indies’ Desmond Haynes, who amassed 148 on debut against Australia in 1978.
Earlier, New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won his second successive toss and elected to field against an understrength South Africa.

South Africa has entered the tournament without seven of its Champions Trophy players, who will arrive at Karachi over the weekend.
Breetzke is not part of South Africa’s Champions Trophy squad. On Monday he joined Colin Ingram, Temba Bavuma and Reeza Hendricks on the list of South Africans to hit a hundred on debut.
He reached his half-century in just 68 balls. He dispatched O’Rourke through deep third to bring up his century off 128 balls and then put foot on the accelerator. Breetzke’s 148-ball knock consisted of 11 fours and five sixes.
His classy knock helped South Africa post 304 for 6.

Title: Champions Trophy 2025: Pakistan have enough depth to be dangerous, says Ravi Shastri
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/champions-trophy-2025-pakistan-have-enough-depth-to-be-dangerous-says-ravi-shastri-9827864/
Content:
Former India coach Ravi Shastri and Australian captain Ricky Ponting has backed Mohammad Rizwan-led Pakistan to qualify for the knockouts of the Champions Trophy. Pakistan will enter the tournament as defending champions. They have defeated their arch-rivals India in the final in 2017. Pakistan will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against New Zealand in Karachi on Februrary 19 before taking on arch rivals India on February 23 in Dubai
“I think Pakistan are the kind of side that, with the exposure they’ve had in the last six to eight months in white-ball cricket, have put up some really strong performances, especially in South Africa,” Shastri said in The ICC Review.
“They’ve missed Ayub at the top, and he’s a crucial player. But Pakistan have enough depth to be dangerous, especially in home conditions. I would say they should qualify for the semi-finals and from there, it’s anyone’s game.
“Pakistan are still very, very dangerous, and if they qualify, they’ll be doubly more dangerous.”
Ricky Ponting said the pace quartet of Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain can be very lethal.
Pakistan’s fast bowling brigade is very, very good. Led by Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, who’ve been terrific in recent series, they have the pace and skill to trouble any batting line-up,” he said.
“Babar has been a bit up and down in recent years, but if he and (Mohammad) Rizwan can bring their A-games, that’s when Pakistan becomes incredibly dangerous,” Ponting said.
“They’ve still got enough high-quality players to beat any team on any given day. If they play well, they’ll be right in it
“The pressure of playing at home can work both ways. It can be a real motivator, especially with the home crowd behind you. That support can sometimes help you cross the line in big moments,” Ponting said.

Title: Ravindra Jadeja shares update on Jasprit Bumrah’s fitness, showers praise on captain Rohit Sharma
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravindra-jadeja-opens-up-on-jasprit-bumrahs-fitness-showers-praise-on-captain-rohit-sharma-9827784/
Content:
All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja in his post-match press conference in Cuttack gave update about Jasprit Bumarah’s injury and also showered praise on captain Rohit Sharma, who scored his 32nd ODI century in the second match against England.
“In the dressing room, we’re not worried at all,” said Jadeja on Rohit’s form.
Rohit Sharma, who last scored a half-century in October and averaged less than 11 in his last 16 international innings across the formats, hit a 76-ball century.
“He’s such a big player that he knows how to get back in form. It was just matter of one inning.
“It didn’t feel like he has not scored runs in the last few innings. It was a smooth knock and played some confident shots. Sometimes it’s just about one or two innings.
“If one or two innings go well, it’s a good thing. Him getting back in the form before the Champions Trophy is important for us. I think it’s excellent for the team.
“Obviously, he knows what his game is. There’s nothing to think about or discuss.”
India won the first ODI in Nagpur by four wickets, took a 2-0 lead in the three-match series. The hosts had also won the preceding Twenty20 series 4-1.
Sharma scored 119 runs off 90 balls, hitting seven sixes and 12 fours, as India finished with 308-6 in 44.3 overs. Shubman Gill hit a second successive half-century in the series – 60 off 52 balls with nine fours and a six.
When coaxed about Jasprit Bumrah’s availability for the Champions Trophy, Jadeja said:  “It’s not my department.”
“It’s the job of medical department, they’re following up.
“Hopefully, he gets fit. It will be huge boost for us. It is good for the whole country as well not only for our team.”

Title: India vs England ODI: Explain floodlight malfunction, Odisha govt asks cricket body
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-odi-explain-floodlight-malfunction-odisha-govt-asks-cricket-body-9827750/
Content:
The Odisha government on Monday asked the Odisha Cricket Association (OCA) to submit an explanation for the disruption during the second ODI match between India and England at Barabati Stadium in Cuttack. The floodlight malfunction during India’s 305 run chase on Sunday evening forced a 35-minute stoppage, triggering massive outrage against the organisers.
With India 48 for no loss in 6.1 overs, the tower stationed past the long-on boundary began to flicker before shutting down completely. India captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill soon walked to the dugout before the England team followed suit.
According to OCA sources, the generator connected to one of the six floodlight structures at the venue had conked off, forcing a nearly 35-minute stoppage.
“This incident led to about 30 minutes suspension of the match, causing inconvenience to players and spectators. The OCA is hereby directed to submit a detailed explanation for the cause of the disruption and identify the persons/ agencies who were responsible for such lapses and outline the measures taken to prevent similar incidents in the future,” said a letter issued by the Odisha sports department to the OCA.
The OCA has been asked to submit the explanation within 10 days.
The incident also raised serious concerns about OCA’s efficiency in hosting international matches at Barabati that hosted an ODI after six years.
The incident on Sunday evening also triggered a political row with the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the opposition party in Odisha questioning  the BJP government’s seriousness in organising international matches.

Title: India vs England: If even Rohit Sharma can be under pressure, we should be easier on ourselves, says Jos Buttler
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-if-even-rohit-sharma-can-be-under-pressure-we-should-be-easier-on-ourselves-says-jos-buttler-9827683/
Content:
If a player of Rohit Sharma’s calibre could face pressure at times, the others should be a bit “easier” on themselves, said England skipper Jos Buttler as he hailed the Indian skipper’s much-awaited century as a lesson in modern and dynamic ODI batting.
Facing intense scrutiny over his form and calls of retirement, the 37-year-old Rohit returned to form with his first century in the ODI format in 16 months to power India to a series-clinching win here on Sunday.
“It’s probably a nice reminder for all of us that if someone of Rohit’s caliber can be under pressure, we should be a bit easier on ourselves,” Buttler said after their four-wicket loss here.
“He’s been a great player for such a long period of time and top players generally come up with the goods and he obviously did that today.” “Any time you’re playing against great players and they’re playing an innings like that, I’m sure players on both sides will be watching and learning. He played a brilliant innings and (displayed) how he can go up and down the gears and absorb pressure, put a lot of pressure back on (the opponent),” Buttler added in full admiration of Rohit’s blistering 119 off 90 balls.
Rohit found his mojo right from the outset, taking on England’s new-ball attack of Saqib Mahmood and Gus Atkinson before dismantling the express pacer Mark Wood and spinner Adil Rashid to turn India’s 305-run chase into a one-sided contest.
The England captain also lauded Rohit’s adaptability and said watching a player of his stature in action was a learning experience.
“He really showed (that) in this day and age, in the modern sort of way of playing 50-over cricket, it’s very dynamic, very aggressive. He scored at a rate just confirms really that the way we want to play is the right way that you have to play to try and win games in cricket,” Buttler said.
“The way Rohit played showed that the way we want to play our cricket is the way, the correct way to play cricket.” Once again, England got off to a flier scoring 75 for no loss in first 10 overs with Ben Duckett and Phil Salt making the most of the powerplay, before Indian spinners led by Ravindra Jadeja’s three-wicket haul seized the momentum. Buttler felt England fell short of a match-winning total.
“We, again, started really well. I thought Duckett and Salt played the powerplay brilliantly and got in some nice positions. We just needed one or two of us to sort of really kick on and play a real innings of note and maybe push our score up to 330-350 kind of territory,” Buttler said.
“But some positives (are) there, we’ve been making steps again in the right direction, but probably didn’t (put), not the perfect, complete performance with the bat. Credit to Rohit Sharma, I thought he played a fantastic knock. He’s set the standard in ODI cricket for a while and another great innings today,” he added.
Despite the defeat, Buttler counted on the positives in England’s approach and emphasised the importance of learning from such moments.
“Any time you don’t win games in cricket, that tends to be what happens. You just weren’t quite good enough for long enough. In the cycle of the team, there’s a few players who are just gaining experience and days like today are great lessons and that’s what you want.
“You’ve got to accelerate that learning and keep pushing the guys in the right direction. Like I say, we’re doing some things right. You always want to do some things better,” he added.
Buttler also acknowledged Joe Root’s crucial contribution after the senior batter top scored with a 72-ball 69.
“He’s been someone we always rely on, can play that role to bat a lot of time. He doesn’t face many dot balls, but he’s always scoring at a good rate and he’s a very consistent player. So, yeah, (he is a) really important guy in our team,” Buttler signed off.

Title: Rohit Sharma after scoring his 32nd ODI hundred in Cuttack: ‘It was just another day in the office’

Team India captain Rohit Sharma says he understands what is required of him in the middle and called his century against England in the second ODI in Cuttack just “another day in the office.” Rohit Sharma ended a poor run of form with his 32nd ODI hundred as India beat England by four wickets in the second ODI to win the series on Sunday.
“When people have played for number of years and has scored so many runs over the years. That means something. I have played this game for a long time now and I understand what is required of me,” he told BCCI.tv.
“Its just about going out there and doing your things. What I did today was one of my things. In my mind it was just about doing the things that I do, try and bat the way I do.
“Like I said I have been here long enough. One or two knocks is not going to change my mind. It was just another day in the office.
“We need to do our job. Our job is to just go out there and play the game. As long as you go out there and you know that today when you go to bed you know that you have given your best. That is what matters.
“Every time I walk on the pitch, walk on to play the game I want to try and do well. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it may not happen. As long as I am clear what I want to do. That’s all matters. Nothing else matters.
“When you have scored so many runs, you’ve done something right then you just need to get back to that… the mindset of how to score runs.
“It sounds really simple but it is quite difficult. In my mind it was just about enjoying that is what we play the sport for to enjoy the game more than anything else.”
Rohit Sharma, who last scored a half-century in October and averaged less than 11 in his last 16 international innings across the formats, hit a 76-ball century.
Sharma scored 119 runs off 90 balls, hitting seven sixes and 12 fours, as India finished with 308-6 in 44.3 overs.
“I really broke it down into pieces about how I wanted to bat,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation.
“It’s a 50-over format, a little longer than T20 format and a little shorter than Test cricket obviously – a lot shorter than Test cricket – but obviously you still need to break it down and assess what you need to do at regular intervals and that is what I kept doing. It was important for a batter who gets set, needs to bat as deep as possible and that was my focus.”

Title: India vs England: Ravindra Jadeja says playing Ranji Trophy helped him get back in rhythm
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-ravindra-jadeja-says-playing-ranji-trophy-helped-him-get-back-in-rhythm-9827551/
Content:
All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja on Sunday credited Ranji Trophy for getting back in the rhythm ahead of the ongoing ODI series against England. In the two matches against England, Jadeja has not only finished the games with bat but has managed to scalp six wickets and has kept the run flow in check in the middle overs.
“I’m playing for the first time in almost two years (1.5 years) after the World Cup final. I have to get used to this format. I think the domestic game helped me a lot,” Jadeja told reporters in Cuttack after India’s four-wicket win.
Before this match, Jadeja has played two Ranji Trophy games. Against Delhi, he bowled 30 overs and picked up a ten-wicket haul, while against Assam he didn’t bowled.
“I bowled in 30-odd overs in the Ranji trophy. That’s why the rhythm was consistent,” he said.
“Be it in the Test match or in the ODIs, I try and bowl the same line and length. There was a continuity in the rhythm because the break wasn’t that long. I think the domestic game helped me a lot,” he said.
Jadeja is one of the five spinner India have picked in their 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy.
“It’s a good thing it will be where we’re going to play. We’ll find out how the wicket will be once we will go there,” he said.
“But if the spin department is doing well, I think it’s good for the team.
“In the middle overs with five fielders inside, if you are taking wickets, stopping the run flow and is not giving easy boundaries, it’s good. I think it’s for the team if fast bowlers and spinners are bowling as a unit, it’s a good sign for the team. We’re doing well collectively in every game.”
Earlier this week, former Indian off-spinner R Ashwin said that the media does not “appreciate” Jadeja and he is also “more gifted” cricketer than Ashwin himself.
“Our media fails to appreciate when a player does well. Whenever we lose, everyone becomes a villain. He dismissed Joe Root (in the 1st IND vs ENG ODI). Jadeja goes always under the radar. He is a “Jackpot Jango”. He is +10 in the field, also bowls well and bats in pressure situations as well. We don’t give Jadeja enough credit,” he said on his YouTube channel in the show Ash Ki baat.

Title: Ranji Trophy: An India call is not expected, but Jalaj Saxena continues all-round shows to keep Kerala afloat vs J&K
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-jalaj-saxena-allround-show-jammu-kashmir-9826982/
Content:
Jalaj Saxena is 38 and he chuckles that he “doesn’t really expect the phone to ring tomorrow.” That is cricket-speak for getting picked to play for India, and the selectors calling up with the news. It’s just that instead of staring at the phone waiting eternally for it to ring, he decided to go hammer and tongs against the run of play, and keep reminding the young ‘uns that a Ranji Trophy quarterfinal is five days long.
He is not filmy enough to say, ‘Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.’ But for 78 balls, he kept punching holes in a pretty sturdy J&K bowling unit, almost teasing them for not managing to tame an old ‘un like him. His 67 had six fours and three sixes, looking utterly unbothered by cloying pace or taunting spin.
“It’s an unrealistic dream (being picked for India),” but what’s left if you stop dreaming, he says. So, might as well keep putting himself out there, and reminding selectors of what they are overlooking.
Saxena’s type-face of spin bowling-allrounder was taken. Ravichandran Ashwin, Washington Sundar. Jayant Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav. There was always someone. So, he just went about accumulating runs and wickets, not bothering to get tagged the dreaded word: ‘domestic giant’. But because he was so good at what he did, it put Kerala in the quarters.
“I don’t get sleepless nights about why selectors are not picking me. It’s just that the India dream keeps me motivated. I still have that dream to play for India, but no expectations,” he says. It’s a strangely content mindspace. Luckily for his home state Madhya Pradesh and now Kerala, where he’s a much-loved guest player, his constant efforts to stay relevant has done them a lot of good.
Against J&K, Saxena single-handedly stemmed a dam-burst as Auqib Nabi wreaked havoc. “He’s very nippy and was bowling in the right areas,” Saxena explained. It was his cue to enter battle.
“Three wickets down (for a measly 11), I had to back my instincts. It was tricky because another couple of wickets would’ve done us in. I took calculated risks. Told myself I’ve done this in the past.”
It was plainly an assault, when he started with a pair of sixes, making it look like he and the rest were batting on two different pitches. Umar Nazir had a stranglehold on opener Akshay Chandran which never loosened. Saxena though, with his wide-spaced golf-club like grip, flicked the massive Nazir to fine leg for a six. He struck an encore, just for kicks. Nasir Lone, marginally slower, was maced over point.
Saxena, single-handedly, might’ve pushed this contest into the fourth day. “It was not the correct time to be disappointed,” he would later say about the match situation and his career. “It’s called a Test match (5-day game) for a reason. We can still get back into this game,” he promised as Kerala reached 200/9 and MD Nidheesh and Salman Nizar took their cues to retaliate in aggressive fashion.
“When I get into my zone, I back myself to play shots,” Saxena said. “In the off-season, I do my hard work,” he would say, looking as fit as any of the other tough ones.

Not being off-spinner No.1 might’ve scuttled his India goals, but the veteran’s all-round shows with T20-style batting are helping the state team. “I even opened for my state. I can always bat,” he would remind with a smile. Bat rather well, actually.”

Title: IND vs ENG: How Rohit Sharma proved talks of his waning prowess was grossly exaggerated with his second fastest hundred
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-century-waning-prowess-second-fastest-ind-eng-9826964/
Content:
Rohit Sharma had forewarned of writing him off in this version just yet. A seven-ball outing in Nagpur may have held the question over his head intact. But in a 142-minute masterclass at the Barabati Stadium on Sunday, the Indian captain wiped out detractors and England’s 304-run defence with his 32nd ODI century. First-game heroes Shubman Gill (60) and Shreyas Iyer (44) chipped in before India claimed a four-wicket victory and the series win with 33 balls to spare. On a day where the pacers were blunted by the England top-order, Ravindra Jadeja’s metronomic 3/35 had earlier denied the visitors a higher finish. When the local media reacted with rapturous applause to an early Rohit maximum, a couple of their English counterparts were left wondering if they were teleported to the Western Terrace back home at Headingley for a moment. For the Indian captain though, Sunday was all about reconnecting with happier times from not so long ago.

The distance seemed to grow larger with every passing innings since last October, but in an eye-popping reboot of the senses, Rohit ticked back to the 2023 home World Cup mode, butchering pace and the new ball to shreds in the V.
Perhaps his balletic belligerence was a touch overwhelming for the cricket-deprived Cuttack scribes or it was the simple joy of collectively forming an atmosphere that provided a lifeline to another waning international career, as they did in 2017 when Yuvraj Singh cracked 150 in his comeback ODI series after four years. Rohit’s first six had teased glimpses of a better zone. The flick had betrayed him in the first game, in the Ranji Trophy and in Australia too. But when Gus Atkinson came firing on length in the second over, Rohit unfurled the chip over the 30-yard circle with precision. With the shuffle inside the crease from outside leg to the off-stump on point and the right amount of muscle finally meeting the Kookaburra, Rohit eventually dispatched an international six after four months. The synapses fell back magically when Rohit flayed Saqib Mahmood over extra cover for another maximum in the next over and followed with another smite down the ground soon after. Even a half-an-hour floodlight fiasco could not disrupt Rohit’s tempo thereafter as India climbed to fifty within seven overs. Bossing his equation with Gill once again, Rohit craved more aerial spaces to unsettle Jos Buttler’s English attack.

The template was an all too familiar sight in the World Cup year in 2023 where Gill blossomed as a patient accumulator and Rohit stupefied oppositions with his spell-binding six-hitting range. With his manic short balls lacking the usual venom on a slightly soft Cuttack strip, Mark Wood explored the fuller lengths as Rohit pummelled a yorker-length delivery over long-on for another six with economic movement. Rohit and Gill raised their sixth hundred-run stand in only 27 games together within 14 overs. While Gill and a returning Virat Kohli’s dismissals in succession had temporarily muted him, Rohit sped to his century by biffing Wood and leggie Adil Rashid into the crowd, the 76-ball century marking the second quickest of his career.
While he saw off a brief middle-order wobble and sealed the chase alongside Axar Patel (41 not out) with a rasping drive through cover, it was Jadeja’s inimitable middle-overs presence with the ball that helped the hosts make up for the poor lengths over which the pacers operated. As Mohammad Shami, Harshit Rana and Hardik Pandya’s waning lengths outside the stumps played to the strengths of England openers Ben Duckett and Phil Salt, India had to fall back on Jadeja’s simplicity to fight back. Heading into the Champions Trophy, the left-arm spinner has reimposed himself as India’s lead white-ball spinner in the set-up with successive three-fors as Kuldeep Yadav has yet to regain his wicket-taking rhythm. Fifty per cent of his 10 overs jotted with dot balls, Jadeja outgunned half-centurions Duckett (65) and Joe Root at crucial junctures to keep England at least 30 short on a wicket that held shape reasonably well throughout. While their cross-batted range had worked spectacularly against the pacers after winning the toss, Buttler’s men could not sustain the momentum at the death where Rohit banked on more overs of spin to close out the innings. Liam Livingstone’s late charge against Mohammad Shami and Harshit Rana added 43 runs in the last four, but a quiet five-over stretch between overs 42 and 46 denied another comprehensive finish. Jadeja nipped out the well-set Root (69) and Jamie Overton in successive overs while Varun Chakaravarthy and Axar Patel combined to concede only 18 from as many deliveries.  Even as a 300-plus finish would have held competitive on a track that was slightly sluggish and offered turn in the absence of dew after sunset, the English plans were expertly warped by Rohit’s magical reminder. This was indeed a “different format, a different time”.

Title: No IPL contract, no India A spot but J&K’s Auqib Nabi Dar is making a name for himself
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/auqib-nabi-dar-jammu-kashmir-no-ipl-contracy-india-a-ranji-9826920/
Content:
Auqib Nabi Dar grew up playing tennis ball cricket in Baramulla, Kashmir, on grounds where speedsters just couldn’t use spikes. Elite cricket is high-maintenance and hallowed that way. When his feet couldn’t turn into hot wheels, the J&K pacer set off honing his wrist-work and ended up with one of the smoothest and deceptively jumbling mix of inswingers and outswingers, working his way out to snare wickets with the new ball and old.
All through this self-motivated upskilling, he kept in mind what his seniors at the humble Baramulla Cricket Club told him when the cricket dream looked distant: “Work in silence. Never talk back. Show them what you are when playing, because nobody can stop you on the run-up.”
With 42 wickets this season alone – almost half his career-tally of 85 – the 28-year-old has become J&aK’s highest wicket taker, surpassing Parvez Rasool, since debuting in 2016 with impressive consistency of 6 five-fors in this campaign.
He has endured early injuries, limited facilities in development years, indifference from ‘India A’ consideration and complete silence from IPL teams in auctions, with franchises unwilling to even look at him. But when he lined up for J&K’s quarterfinal against Kerala at Pune, he decided to focus on the task ahead and set aside all past struggles.
“There are struggles, but I won’t talk about them. Playing red ball cricket was a dream. Right now, Ranji is my biggest stage,” he would say after taking 5-36 in a strangling tandem alongside Umar Nazir (they bowled 6 maidens each) as Kerala were restricted to 200/9 responding to J&K’s 280.
Auqib can take some solid credit for taking J&K’s middling 210/8 and elevating it to a chunkier 280 because he turned up at No.10 and gave a dull Sunday morning its crisp espresso fix with a 30-ball 32 with 2 boundaries and 1 chunky six. Like Mark Knopfler would’ve crooned, “Oh yeah, the boy can play.”
Kerala were mildly bewildered, as he routinely charged the bowlers, coolly taking three unrushed strides down the pitch and tonking gloriously away. Against Kerala’s competent quicks, it was frankly audacious. But they had ceded 60-odd before they realised what to do with this Mad Max, strutting into the storm.
What his team know Auqib for though, is his serene silence. He simply doesn’t like talking much. Even during his aggressive bowling spell and batting counters, there’s none of the lippy talk going on. He’s taken after his idol Dale Steyn and Jasprit Bumrah, in that sense. But he doesn’t even smile, so the business-like silence where batsmen being evicted is incidental, is even more menacing.
Kerala opener Rohan Kunnummal prodded at an out-swinging delivery, and was gone by the second ball. Shoun Roger lasted just 5 deliveries without scoring, and was gone to an incoming one while stuck in the crease caught by the keeper. Auqib would return for a late afternoon spell to send back the dangerous and well-set Jalaj Saxena (67 off 78), and complete the five, clean bowling Nedumankuzhy Basil. But it was Sachin Baby’s wicket on 2 (15) that will stay imprinted on minds. It was a peach of a yorker nailing Kerala’s best batter and captain, as they were left tottering at 11/3. “We are in quarters after a long time. Performing here is a big thing,” he said, when asked if he fretted over non inclusion in India A’s.
Saxena had sent two sixes surfing to the same fine leg spot earlier on, where he was eventually trapped, as the rising ball rushed on him two clicks faster. Auqib’s set-ups tend to focus on silently nuancing pace to lull and lure into lethality. He celebrates wickets alright, but the confidence comes from how coach Pudiyangum Krishnakumar keeps saying positive things to him, despite errors. Like, knowing, he’s never going to give up on Auqib. “Rest is just bowling in the right places,” he says.
His batting aggression also came from the coaches telling him to go berserk – knowing a statement of intent needed to be made in the first hour when bowlers had suffocated J&K top order yesterday. “Coach said, Go attack.” Auqib merely freed his long levers.
Baramulla hadn’t seen anyone like him in U19s, and his trials were actually used to spread the word around of a prodigious bowler, who didn’t need speed (though he could crank it up), to clatter stumps. The cutters were exquisite. A good crowd came, just to be awed. “He’s natural. His skills are god-gifted. He learnt early from Baramulla club mates to take everything from criticism to praise with silence. He’s shy basically, but he listens and learns,” informs manager Hilal Ahmed.
In his U19s debut, he quietened some loud Punjab opponents with 5 wickets and a 50. Against Saurashtra colts, he was sent at the fall of two quick wickets, and he slammed a 100. “We had been fielding for a day and a half. So when I got to batting, I scored a 100,” he recalls simply.
He started cricket following friends, but never knowing the real magic of a leather ball. “We never played with the hard ball. The ground wasn’t good enough to wear spikes. Just tennis ball. Red ball mindset took time. Now we’ve played lots of red ball cricket. That’s the change,” he says of 40 wickets in 6 seasons, and 44 in this one alone.
He quietly plays in the Karnataka local league, and when back home, gathers around youngsters to bat and bowl against. “He won’t sit at home idle, nor waste time ruing,” Ahmed says.
His father, a government teacher, wanted him to study. “Initially they were opposed to cricket and would yell because I was good at studies.” There was talk of studying medicine. The day he scored 100 vs Saurashtra and the press landed at his home, his father was a convert. “He told the media – Mera nechu (son) India khelke aaega. Aap likho.”

It hasn’t quite happened yet. But you never know what that famous silence is quietly brewing. Five Kerala wickets bubbled over, at any rate.

Title: IND vs ENG: With suspense around Jasprit Bumrah, India bring in Varun Chakaravarthy’s mystery
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-varun-chakravarthy-india-jasprit-bumrah-suspense-9826868/
Content:
Is India’s answer to the Jasprit Bumrah puzzle for the Champions Trophy a slow bowler? Someone with similarly unusual quirks at the crease and not born out of the typical bowling manual.
Varun Chakaravarthy’s ODI debut at 33 in the second ODI against England at the Barabati Stadium was not entirely about the wickets column but more of the white-ball secret sauce that is yet to be completely demystified and diluted by oppositions. In Bumrah’s absence, it seems to be an enticing prospect for the team management, who drafted the Tamil Nadu tweaker into the 50-over side after his brilliant T20I series against the visitors last month, where he snapped 14 wickets in 5 outings.
A debut seemed far-fetched for Chakaravarthy with India’s likely first-choice combination yet to hit the field, 11 days out from their Champions Trophy opener in Dubai. But with three days still in the bank to announce any last-minute tweaks to the provisionally announced 15-member squad, Chakaravarthy’s inclusion on Sunday meant that there could still be room for a late twist to the Indian roster, more so if Bumrah’s recovery takes time.

It could be compelling for India to ponder a move for Chakaravarthy as the seam attack continues to wear an inconsistent look, and the imminently better bet would be to shore up the spin stocks behind Ravindra Jadeja. Chakaravarthy’s addition came at the expense of the team’s lead wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who is working his own way back into the squad after a brief injury lay-off.
The one-dimensional seam attack’s profligacy was laid bare when Mohammad Shami, Harshit Rana and Hardik Pandya fed England openers Ben Duckett and Phil Salt boundless room to cut and pull in the first powerplay. Much of the first 10 overs’ action occurred square of the wicket as Shami struggled to temper his angles to the left-handed Duckett. A regulation catching opportunity that Axar Patel let slip off at deep backward point in the sixth over off Pandya’s bowling, forced the seamer down to his haunches after a frustrating start.
With Rana playing two games ahead of the Dubai-bound Arshdeep Singh, one can assume that head coach Gautam Gambhir and Co have taken the series to prepare for all scenarios they currently visualise without Bumrah. However, Rana’s natural affinity for shorter lengths has forced India to summon the first-change bowler quite early within the first powerplay in both games.
As the seam trio failed to attack the stumps or attempt fuller deliveries to the England openers automatically aligned to wield their cross-batted strokes, Chakaravarthy’s injection in the ninth over briefly helped India plug the haemorrhage.
That England have been iffy in their plans against him throughout this tour was best summed up by Chakaravarthy’s 11th delivery. The mystery man stuck to conventions this time with a flighted leg break that offered Salt a minimal margin for error with the heave across the line miscued to Jadeja at mid-on. A cracking follow-up to Joe Root nearly packed the England No. 3 first ball, but the sharp-spinning googly had turned way down the leg-side after rapping the pads.
Save for a slot delivery outside the off-stump that Harry Brook magnificently carted over extra-cover for a maximum, Chakaravarthy’s first spell of six overs conceding 26 had the Bazballers wound to the crease, suppressing their wonts before 17 dots and a solitary release shot.
While his eventual figures (1/54) did not vouch for a wholesome read, India captain Rohit Sharma entrusted him with two overs at the death alongside Jadeja, the two being the only bowlers to complete their quota of 10 overs between the reckless spells of the pace contingent.

With veteran Shami yet to regain full steam, Rana blowing hot and cold, Kuldeep yet to add enough overs under his belt and India tight-lipped on the Bumrah situation, Chakaravarthy’s six-over spell teased a little spark before the Champions Trophy’s final squad deadline day falling in three days on February 12.

Title: Ranji wrap: Spin shines for Mumbai, Ankit resists for Haryana; familiar collapse for TN
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-wrap-spin-mumbai-ankit-haryana-tamil-nadu-collapse-9826842/
Content:
After two frustrating sessions, Mumbai’s spinners Tanush Kotian and Shams Mulani brought them back into the contest against Haryana at the Eden Gardens. The two spinners who scored 97 and 91 respectively to rescue Mumbai with the bat, played their part with the ball as well at a critical juncture when Haryana seemed to be running away with the game. After shutting out Mumbai for 315 in the first session, skipper Ankit Kumar led from the front once again with the bat, scoring 136. The 27-year-old opener is known for his gritty knocks and on Sunday, he largely struck to it to carve out a century that deflated Mumbai attack.
Though none of his teammates so far have managed to convert the starts, he fought single-handedly to push Haryana closer to Mumbai’s total and beyond. At one stage, it appeared Haryana would easily go past Mumbai’s total but Kotian and Mulani struck crucial blows to take two wickets each. It meant at the end of Day 2, Haryana were placed at 263/5 with the first session set to be a crucial one for both teams.
Brief scores: Mumbai 315 (Tanush Kotian 97, Sams Mulani 91; Anshul Kamboj 3/71, Sumit Kumar 3/81) vs Haryana 263/5 (Ankit Kumar 136).
It feels like déjà vu all over again for Tamil Nadu. Green top, ball seaming around and their top-order showing once again they aren’t equipped to survive in those conditions. And as a result, Tamil Nadu are slowly losing their grip over their fixture against Vidarbha at Nagpur. Despite coming to bat only in the second session of Day 2, TN batsmen were exposed by Vidarbha seamers with Aditya Thakare walking away at the end of the day with four scalps in his pocket. Off his first over he removed Mohamed Ali with a peach before getting their No 3, 4 and 5.
When N Jagadeesan departed for 22 after edging a delivery any good opener would have shouldered arms to, TN’s middle-order was exposed to the newball. B Sai Sudharsan perished going for a cut with the fielder at point taking a diving catch. Boopathi Kumar and Vijay Shankar paid the price for hanging their bat outside the off-stump. Only Andre Siddarth, shone bright, scoring a characteristic 65 off 89 deliveries with 10 boundaries and two sixes as TN’s hopes of staying in the contest all but ended when they slid to 136/6 as they were placed 159/6 trailing Vidarbha by 194 runs.
Earlier in the first session, overnight pair of Karun Nair and Harsh Dubey kept their partnership growing with help from TN fielders. Though Nair was dismissed for 122, Dubey’s dodgy effort of 69 runs that saw him cross 400 runs for the season to go with 50-plus wickets, took Vidarbha to 353.
Brief scores: Vidarbha 353 (Karun Nair 122, Harsh Dubey 69; Vijay Shankar 3/75, Sonu Yadav 3/91) vs Tamil Nadu 159/6 (Andre Siddarth 65; Aditya Thakare 4/18).
At Rajkot, in their derby clash against Saurashtra, it is Gujarat which is beginning to take control of the quarterfinal. After shutting the hosts to 216, their decision to bowl first was vindicated as Gujarat batsmen put up a fighting display to end Day 2 with a lead of 44 runs and 6 wickets in hand. But it wasn’t without drama. In the first session both their openers Aarya Desai (11) and Priyank Panchal (25) and by the time Siddarth Desai was dismissed Gujarat were struggling at 78/3. Though he didn’t score big, Desai blunted the new ball by consuming 92 deliveries. It meant Manan Hingrajia and Jaymeet Patel were able to build an innings, cutting down the risk.

With enough time in the bag, they went about their innings patiently with Hingrajia’s 83 coming off 219 deliveries before being dismissed by Dharmendrasinh Jadeja. But Jaymeet (88*) was unmoved at the other end with wicketkeeper Urvil Patel providing good support. It meant, Gujarat overhauled Saurashtra’s total with ease. On Day 3, they will look to consolidate their position further, especially with Urvil around as he has the ability to take away the game in quick time. If they don’t strike early in the first session, Saurashtra could struggle to make their way back into the match.
Brief scores: Saurashtra 216 vs Gujarat 260/4 (Jaymeet Patel 88 batting, Manan Hingraji 83).

Title: IND vs ENG: Rohit Sharma returns to form, scores 32nd ODI century in Cuttack vs England
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-rohit-sharma-32nd-odi-100-century-cuttack-9826822/
Content:
India skipper Rohit Sharma roared back into form with a timely century against England at Cuttack in the 2nd ODI on Sunday. This was Rohit’s 32nd century in the 50-over format and his first since the ton against Afghanistan back in 2023. He also brought up his half century at the Barabati in just 30 deliveries.
Rohit went after the England bowlers from the get-go, bringing up his ton in 76 deliveries, peppered with 7 sixes and 9 fours. This was a welcome return to form for a player who had been suffering a lean patch with dismal performances against New Zealand and Australia in recent Test series.
Earlier, Rohit had surpassed West Indies batter Chris Gayle to rise up to second in the highest six-hitters in ODIs. Rohit, who started the match tied with Gayle with 331 maximums, surpassed the West Indies icon when he smashed a six over midwicket with his trademark flick shot to Gus Atkinson in the 2nd over.
He would follow that six with two more maximums and go up to 334 but he is still behind Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi who has 371. The Indian skipper looked to have regained some of his form after a lean period as he smashed 29 off 18 deliveries before the match suffered a brief stoppage due to a floodlight issue.
Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja continued his stranglehold over English batters with brilliant figures of 3 for 35 as India bowled out the visitors for a sub-par score of 304.

On a good batting surface, Jadeja’s crucial breakthroughs came against the run of play as he dismissed an aggressive Ben Duckett (65 off 56 balls) and a well-set Joe Root (69 off 72 balls), preventing England from building on their strong start.

Title: Floodlight malfunction causes 35-minute stoppage during India’s chase in Cuttack

Content:
India’s 305-run chase against England at the Barabati Stadium on Sunday evening suffered an unusually lengthy pause due to a floodlight malfunction.
With India 48 for no loss in 6.1 overs, the tower stationed past the long-on boundary began to flicker before shutting down completely. India captain Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill soon walked to the dugout before the England team followed suit.

According to an Odisha Cricket Association official, the generator connected to one of the six floodlight structures at the venue had conked off, forcing a nearly 35-minute stoppage. “There was a short-circuit issue with the generator and we had to get it replaced,” the official told The Indian Express.
“Regular testing has been done in the lead-up to this match. We have been testing it for up to five hours everyday for the last five days,” the official said.

While the relatively old stadium structure owned by the Orissa Olympic Association (OOA) is in need of major overhaul in seating and other facilities, the modern LED floodlights were relatively recent upgrades.
“There are no concerns with the floodlights in particular as they were part of the partial renovations we have undertaken at the ground over the last few years. The old lights were replaced by the new LED towers in 2022. There is also a need to improve the seating facilities with covered stands and efforts are being put into getting the government backing for that,” an OCA committee member said.

Sunday’s ODI match was the first 50-over game held in Cuttack since November 2019 and the first international outing since India hosted South Africa in a T20I three years ago. An active stadium since the 1950–51 season, the 48,000-seater ground hosted the third-ever ODI held in the country in 1982.

On a good batting surface, Jadeja’s crucial breakthroughs came against the run of play as he dismissed an aggressive Ben Duckett (65 off 56 balls) and a well-set Joe Root (69 off 72 balls), preventing England from building on their strong start.
Electing to bat, England laid a solid foundation with contributions from Duckett, Root, and skipper Jos Buttler (34 off 35 balls).
At 200/3 in 35 overs, England seemed on course for a 330-plus total, but Jadeja’s disciplined bowling stifled their momentum, denying them the extra 15-20 runs.
England would have struggled to reach 300 if not for Liam Livingstone’s brisk 41 off 32 balls (2×4, 2×6) and Adil Rashid’s explosive five-ball 14, which included three consecutive boundaries off Mohammed Shami.

However, three run-outs in the final couple of overs saw them bowled out with a delivery to spare.
This is in fact the lowest total at Barabati Stadium since 2011 as 350-plus has been the average first innings score since then.

Title: ‘Champions Trophy format makes it more challenging than World Cup’: Temba Bavuma
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/temba-bavuma-champions-trophy-format-challenging-world-cup-9826517/
Content:
South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma on Sunday said that the format of the Champions Trophy makes it more challenging than the World Cup due to there being lesser number of matches which does not allow teams who start in a not so strong note to make a comeback. The Champions Trophy is set to take place in Pakistan from February 19 with India playing all their matches in Dubai.
“In the World Cup, you have time to take stock and step up. But in the Champions Trophy you can’t do that but we are hopeful of going one step further in the tournament,” Bavuma said.
“Obviously, we have our sights on where we want to be in the Champions Trophy this time but the format makes it more challenging for teams when you look at the 50-over World Cup,” he added.
South Africa, the losing finalists of the T20 World Cup 2024, and the finalists of the upcoming World Test Championship, will face off New Zealand on Monday in the second match of the ongoing Tri Series, also including Pakistan, with a depleted squad, and at least five-six players are expected to debut.
This was because many of the players named in the South African squad for the Champions Trophy and tri-series are yet to join the side because they were part of the just-concluded SA20.

“It is a lovely opportunity for a couple of guys who have been doing well in domestic cricket and in T20 leagues to make a statement on what value they can add to the team. The tri-series will give us a chance to acclimatise to playing in Pakistan and get knowledge to share it with a wider group and it is also an opportunity for young players to keep on playing in future,” Bavuma said.

Title: After India, New Zealand one of strongest teams in Champions Trophy: Ravichandran Ashwin
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravichandran-ashwin-new-zealand-india-strongest-champions-trophy-9826489/
Content:
Ravichandran Ashwin has picked India and New Zealand as the two strongest teams in the upcoming Champions Trophy, adding that even though Australia may be missing some of their key personnel, the 2023 ODI World Cup winners are a team which shouldn’t be taken lightly.
“After India, New Zealand is one of the strongest teams in the Champions Trophy. Since the likes of Southee and Boult are not playing, there is a question mark about their bowling attack. Who will accompany Matt Henry? Will it be Will O-Rourke, who has the potential to be a runaway champion of next generation. Will it be Ben Sears? “They have an experienced spin attack with Michael Bracewell and Glenn Phillips. Mitchell Santner is the captain, how is he planning to marshall his resources. New Zealand is definitely a strong team. They are one of the challengers to India,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.
Talking about Australia, the spinner said, “Steven Smith as captain is a marriage made in heaven. Smith is going to captain the team in the Champions Trophy. Will Smith, Head, Maxwell and Labuschagne pull through the team to the semis. I always believe that Australia is a champion team that always brings its A-game in marquee tournaments. Considering Australia have a few issues in their bowling department, a lot will depend on Smith’s form and captaincy.”
He also said that India’s matches in Dubai will feel like home games for the Men in Blue due to their familiarity with the conditions and support.
“India has the home advantage in Dubai, and it almost like every other team is playing an away match against India. This is a problem for the other teams, for sure. Is this preparation with England enough for the Indian team ahead of CT in Dubai? Should we have played a tri-series too? Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa are playing in Pakistan conditions, which would help them in the CT,” Ashwin said.

“India only played against England in India, and moreover, we don’t have a lot of pleasant memories of playing T20s in Dubai. The toss becomes really crucial in Dubai. I think winning the toss becomes crucial,” he added.

Title: WPL 2025: Deepti Sharma named UP Warriorz captain after Alyssa Healy pulls out due to injury
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/wpl-2025-deepti-sharma-named-up-warriorz-captain-after-alyssa-healy-pulls-out-due-to-injury-9826363/
Content:
Deepti Sharma was confirmed as the captain of Women’s Premier League side UP Warriorz ahead of the 2025 season. With Australian superstar Alyssa Healy ruled out of the third season of WPL, the Indian allrounder, who hails from Agra in UP, will get the chance to lead out the WPL side at their home venue in Lucknow. Deepti’s promotion means three out of the five WPL franchises will have Indian skippers, as she joins Harmanpreet Kaur (MI) and Smriti Mandhana (RCB).
Earlier, the Warriorz named West Indies allrounder Cinelle Henry as the replacement for Healy. The West Indies seamer who can bat high in the order has so far played 62 T20Is and has 473 runs and 22 wickets against her name in T20Is.
Warriorz will finally get to play in their home venue in Lucknow in the WPL with the Ekana Cricket Stadium named as one of the four venues. UPW will play the Gujarat Giants (March 3), Mumbai Indians (March 6) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (March 8) in their backyard.
After a tough opening season, Deepti had a fine season in 2024 from a personal perspective. Apart from being the first Indian bowler to take a hat-trick in the WPL, against the Delhi Capitals. She went on to be named the most valuable player of the tournament for her return of 295 runs at a strike rate of 136.57 and 10 wickets. Overall, she has played 17 games for the UP Warriorz, scoring 385 runs in 16 innings, with three half-centuries to her name, along with a highest score of 88 not out.
For India, Deepti has been a bowling mainstay. The 27-year-old has played 124 T20Is, scoring 1086 runs from 79 innings, and has picked up 138 wickets, and is the highest wicket-taker in T20Is for the Indian women’s team. Deepti, who plays for Bengal in the domestic circuit but is from UP, said in a statement, “I am delighted and honoured to be named captain of the UP Warriorz, which is a team from my home state. The UP Warriorz has a fantastic squad, and we are confident that we will entertain our fans with the Warriorz brand of cricket, at the WPL this season as well. We can’t wait to play in Lucknow in front of our home fans, and hope to inspire the next generation of women athletes.”
The UP Warriorz open their WPL Season 3 campaign against the Gujarat Giants on February 16 in Vadodara.

England have called up batter Tom Banton as a cover for injured Jacob Bethell for third ODI against India at Ahmedabad, said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in a press release.
India vs England 2nd ODI Match – Watch Live Cricket Score, Full Scorecard
The 23-year-old Bethell, who scored a half-century and took a wicket in England’s four-wicket defeat in the first ODI at Nagpur, had sustained a left hamstring injury.
“The injury will be assessed further when the team arrives in Ahmedabad on Monday (for the third ODI on Wednesday),” said an England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) release on Sunday.
The 26-year-old Banton, a wicketkeeper-batter has played six ODIs, scoring 134 runs with a highest of 58.
“Banton, who last played for England in an ODI in August 2020, has been in outstanding form in T20 franchise cricket. He is currently the leading run-scorer in the UAE ILT20 competition, where he has amassed 493 runs from 11 innings at an average of 54.77, including two centuries,” said the release.
Baton will arrive in India on Monday. India are 1-0 up in the three-match ODI series.
They made three changes to the side for the second ODI in Cuttack, bringing in Mark Wood, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton in the playing XI in place of the injured Bethell, Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer.
The pitch here is a black soil wicket, and could exhibit variable bounce as the game progresses. Spin will likely come into play on the abrasive surface as the sun beats down. Short square boundaries could aid the batters for a high scoring game.

Title: Corbin Bosch replaces injured Anrich Nortje in South Africa’s Champions Trophy squad
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/corbin-bosch-replaces-injured-anrich-nortje-in-south-africas-champions-trophy-squad-9826218/
Content:
Fast bowler Corbin Bosch has been named in South Africa’s 15-member squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 to be played in Pakistan and in the UAE later this month.
The 30-year-old, who made his One-Day International (ODI) debut against Pakistan in December, replaced the injured Anrich Nortje. Meanwhile, left-arm quick Kwena Maphaka has also been added to the squad as a travelling reserve. Bosch and Maphaka, along with opener Tony de Zorzi, depart for Karachi on Sunday to join the squad for the remainder of the tri-nation ODI series.
Former Pakistan all-rounder Yasir Arafat has joined the support staff as a consultant for both the tri-nation series and the Champions Trophy.
Corbin Bosch made a sensational Test debut in the first Test against Pakistan with a great all-round showing. He took a wicket with his first ball, on his way to fine figures of four for 63. He then counter-attacked smartly with the bat, coming in at 191 for seven and refusing to be pinned down despite being under massive pressure in difficult conditions for batting. His 81 not out at number nine was a terrific inning and hugely significant in the thrilling outcome of the match as it made up the bulk of the Proteas’ 90-run first-innings lead.
But while the 30-year-old was continuing his outstanding recent form with the bat, taking his first-class average this season to 96, he was primarily chosen for his fast bowling. And Bosch came into the game with a first-class record of 72 wickets in 34 matches at a humdrum average of 36.75. He had only taken one five-wicket haul in his career.
Father Tertius, who passed away in perplexing circumstances at the age of just 33 in 2000, shared the new ball between 1987/88 and 1993/94 with De Villiers for the Northerns cricket team that was based at SuperSport Park. Bosch senior claimed 210 wickets in 68 first-class matches at an average of 27.56. His pace and aggression were enough to earn him a place in South Africa’s 1992 World Cup squad and their first Test since isolation, in the West Indies that April.

Title: Australia secure first Test series win in Sri Lanka in 14 years
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/australia-secure-first-test-series-win-in-sri-lanka-in-14-years-9826165/
Content:
Australia wrapped up a comprehensive 2-0 series victory over Sri Lanka, sealing the second test with a commanding nine-wicket win in Galle on Sunday.
Top order batter Marnus Labuschagne flicked a delivery from retiring Sri Lankan player Dimuth Karunaratne to mid-wicket to complete the triumph, just 15 minutes before lunch on the fourth day.
It’s Australia’s first test series win on Sri Lankan soil since 2011.
Their last success here came under Ricky Ponting’s captaincy, a 1-0 victory in 2011. However, they suffered a 3-0 whitewash in 2016 under Steve Smith’s leadership, and the 2022 series ended in a 1-1 draw. This time, with Smith standing in as captain for Pat Cummins, the victory was a welcome redemption.
Australia approached the series with meticulous planning — including a training camp in Dubai — and executed their strategies with precision.
Their batters laid the foundation with big hundreds, allowing the bowlers to dictate terms with attacking fields. Meanwhile, the spinners displayed remarkable discipline and variety, putting relentless pressure on Sri Lanka and paved the way for a resounding 2-0 series win.
The tourists had set the tone early, winning the first test by an innings and 242 runs – Sri Lanka’s heaviest ever test defeat. They remained clinical in the second match, ensuring there was no way back for the hosts.
Sri Lanka resumed Sunday on 211-8, holding a slender lead of just 54 runs, with much riding on vice-captain Kusal Mendis, who had remained unbeaten overnight.
Mendis brought up his second half-century in the game by guiding Nathan Lyon to deep cover but perished in the same over, caught at short square leg by Steve Smith.
The dismissal was a milestone moment – Smith’s 200th Test catch, a feat previously achieved by only four players: Jacques Kallis, Mahela Jayawardene, Rahul Dravid, and Joe Root.
Beau Webster wrapped up the innings soon after, leaving Australia with a modest target of 75 runs.
Sri Lanka briefly found hope when Prabath Jayasuriya removed Travis Head (20) early, caught behind. However, Usman Khawaja (27 not out) and Marnus Labuschagne (26 not out) calmly guided the visitors home with an unbroken 37-run stand.
Alex Carey was named Man of the Match for his outstanding 156 and four dismissals behind the stumps. His innings stands as the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper in Asia.
Steve Smith, the backbone of Australia’s batting, was named Player of the Series, having scored back-to-back centuries .
This victory marks Australia’s fourth consecutive test win, having also won the final two matches of its recent 3-1 home series against India. It plays South Africa in the final of the World Test Championship at Lords in June.
Sri Lanka slumped to its fourth straight defeat, sliding to sixth place in the final WTC standings.

Title: India vs England Cuttack ODI: Varun Chakravarthy makes ODI debut, second oldest Indian to do so in the format

Content:
India handed a debut to spinner Varun Chakravarthy ahead of the second One Day International against Englan in Cuttack. At 33 years and 164 days old, Varun became India’s second-oldest ODI debutant after Farokh Engineer (36y 138d) in 1974.
India vs England 2nd ODI Match – Watch Live Cricket Score, Full Scorecard
Jos Buttler won the toss and opted to bat first, with England in a must-win scenario to keep the series alive. “We’ve made two changes. Yashasvi Jaiswal misses out as Virat Kohli comes back, and Kuldeep Yadav is rested with Varun getting his debut,” Rohit Sharma confirmed at the toss. Virat Kohli’s return to XI announced by Rohit was met with a huge cheer as well. Kuldeep had made a comeback in Nagpur after an injury layoff.
“It was a good performance overall in Nagpur, it’s about continuing that. I loved our energy on the ground, despite not playing this format for a while,” Rohit added at the toss. “The counterattack from Shreyas Iyer was really good, he prides himself on playing with that intent and attitude. And Shubman Gill and Axar Patel made crucial contributions as well.”
11 days out from the team’s first Champions Trophy match, Varun’s inclusion comes at an interesting juncture. India have only more match before their CT campaign and Varun, as things stand, is not part of the squad named for the marquee ICC men’s event of the year. Will a good performance bring him into consideration? Before the series began, with Varun being added to the ODI squad at the 11th hour, Rohit had spoken about Varun brining something different to the table. For his 59 wickets, Varun has a List A average of 14.13 and an economy rate of 4.28 in 23 outings. He was also the leading wicket-taker among spinners in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, snapping up 18 wickets with a best of 5/9 and an average of 12.16.
Follow India vs England Live Blog
Rohit had earlier hinted that Varun could well be in contention for the Champions Trophy with the teams still having time to confirm their final contingent. “He has certainly shown something different. I understand that it is a T20 format but he has clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with him,” he had said in Nagpur. “Clearly during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of. If things plan out really well for us and he does what is required then definitely there is something that we need to think about,” he added.

Title: SA20: MI Cape Town end Sunrisers Eastern Cape’s reign, clinch first title in third season

Pace spearheads Trent Boult and Kagiso Rabada produced an inspired bowling performance to lead MI Cape Town to their maiden SA20 title with a comfortable 76 runs win over two-time champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in the final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday.
Boult was sensational up front as he often can be, finishing with figures of 2/9 while Rabada picked up four wickets, applying the finishing touches to a comfortable win in the end. He claimed 4/25 in 3.4 overs to dismiss Sunrisers Eastern Cape for just 105 in response to MI Cape Town’s 181 for 8 — the second-highest score in a SA20 final.
After finishing last in the previous two seasons, the Rashid Khan-led MI Cape Town clinched the top prize, while it was not to be a three-peat for Sunrisers, who have made it three finals in a row.
“We had a couple of tough years,” Rashid was quoted as saying by the franchise after the win. “(It’s) the highest points across three seasons to start off. Feel happy for this team. Brilliant effort from everyone. Throughout this season, we didn’t play a selfish innings. Every one thought what the team needs. Even today, every one played their natural game. We had KG, Bosch, Boult and then George. So, happy to be part of this bowling line up. Amazing to be back. Missed last year due to back injury. I got a phone call ahead of the season that do you want to lead. I said yes. (MI) is the only franchise that has won every tournament. We have won the IPL, MLC, the ILT20 and now the SA20.”
Ryan Rickelton (33 off 15) and Dewal Brevis (38 off 18) were the stars with the bat for MICT as they posted a solid 181/8. In response SEC never got going as they were reduced to 2/8 in the third over. George Linde picked up two big wickets, that of top scorer Tom Abell and captain Aiden Markram.

Title: IND vs ENG, 2nd ODI: Steve Harminson slams England for skipping training session before Cuttack ODI
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-2nd-odi-steve-harminson-slams-england-for-skipping-training-session-before-cuttack-odi-9825922/
Content:
Former England cricketer Steve Harminson made a scathing attack on England cricket team for not skipping practice session ahead of their must-win game against India in Cuttack on Sunday. While India had a long training session, the Jos Buttler-led side opted not to train. England have lost the T20I series 4-1 and were handed a four-wicket loss in the first one-day international in Nagpur.
“Yes, I must admit, I was surprised when we heard that England were going to have not so much a day off,” Harminson said on TalkSport Cricket.
“Sometimes it can be counterproductive when you keep getting beat or things aren’t going as well as you’d want. Sometimes it is a good thing to get away from it, but like I’ve said in previous podcasts, how England have lost, I struggle to understand, especially with the Champions Trophy coming up, that you just have a complete day off.
“A compulsory one, England don’t do compulsory practises under Brendon McCullum. It’s them that want to work on their game, they go and work on their game. And I mean, what have we had? The series so far, we’ve had five T20s and an ODI. It’s had 340 overs, combined overs, and I mean, that’s probably a full test match, three and three quarter of a day of a Test match.
“In three and three quarter days. So, I mean, it’s not that being demanding on the body point of I think it’s been demanding technically, I think it’s been demanding mentally for some of them. And I think, well, hey, I’m not going to sit here and say you should be going practising, you should be doing this, you should be doing that.”
Steve Harminson also said there is something not quite right and clicking with this England team.
“Where England are with a week or two weeks to go before a Champions Trophy, number 11’s has batted six times in six white ball games, five of them in T20s. Something’s not right. Something needs addressing and people lying in their rooms, playing on a golf course, sitting playing on a PlayStation, possibly lying by a pool.
“Is that going to solve it? Hey, I’m just questioning what a lot of people will be questioning, that there’s something not quite right and clicking with this team because they’re playing against one of the best teams in the world in their own back garden. You could argue it was their B-side in the T20s, it’s their A-side in the 50 overs. And look, like they did before, they might come back and ram this straight down my throat and win here.
“And if they do, I will praise them to the hilt. Good on them. Go for it.
“But I’m very, very, I was a little bit surprised to hear that not one person trained, especially with a 15, 16-man squad and you’re getting beat affectionately 6-0 so far. Sorry, 5-1 in a six-match series so far. I was a little surprised.”

Title: IND vs ENG 2nd ODI: How will pitch for India vs England Cuttack ODI play and what’s weather like in city?

Content:
India will look to seal the 3-match series against England when the two sides lock horns in the 2nd match at Cuttack on Sunday. With Virat Kohli set to return to the playing XI, all eyes will be on him and Rohit Sharma, both of whom have had a dismal last few months in the longest format.
With Kohli set to return, there will be a toss-up between Shreyas Iyer, who bailed India out of a tough spot in Nagpur with a crucial half century and Yashasvi Jaiswal on who will make the team. With the pitch expected to offer turn, India might be tempted to give Varun Chakravarthy a chance here.
According to AccuWeather, the temperature is expected to hover around the early 30s throughout the day with the afternoon temperature expected to be 32 degrees which will make it pretty hot and humid. The temperature will have a steep drop in the evening, going down to 20 degrees while at night, it’ll be 18 degrees
The Cuttack pitch is almost the same as the Nagpur one which will be favourable to the bowlers. Ravindra Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav will be lethal on this surface and India might even give Varun Chakravarthy a whirl. There is a chance of heavy dew as the night progresses as the team which wins the toss will most probably opt to bowl first.
India Squad: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja

England Squad: Harry Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Jos Buttler, Jamie Smith, Philip Salt, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood

Title: IND vs ENG 2nd ODI: Virat Kohli to return, two left-arm spinners for India and no specialist tweaker for England to add from squad
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ind-vs-eng-2nd-odi-predicted-playing-11-virat-kohli-to-return-two-left-arm-spinners-for-india-and-no-specialist-tweaker-for-england-to-add-from-squad-9824990/
Content:
India won the first ODI quite convincingly in Nagpur by four wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series. For England, the second ODI at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack is a must-win to stay alive in the tournament.
England displayed the same issues that they had in the T20I leg of the series. The batters could not deal with Indian spinners and their own bowling attack was short of one more quality spinner to partner up with Adil Rashid. As per India a few boxes were tiked like Shubman Gill’s form after a poor Border Gavaskar Trophy and Ravindra Jadeja’s spell with the ball but Rohit Sharma’s form is still a cause of concern.
Virat Kohli returns
The Indian talisman missed the first game due to an injury in the knee and hence he will return to the team for the second game if fit. Shreyas Iyer who managed to slam a half-century will be the player who will be out of the team as he was not in contention to make the XI in the first place.
Persist with two left-arm spinners?
India does have the option of Washington Sundar in the squad who is an off-spinner and when compared to Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja, Sundar provides a different angle. However, Axar’s performance with the bat in the first game might tempt India to pursue with him. Though both Jadeja and Axar are identical in the job they do Rohit and team management seem to have found a way to use them in diverse way.
No tweaker to add
England did have Rehan Ahmed in the T20I squad however, for the ODI series the leg-spinner has been sent back. Hence even if England wants to there is no other spinner to chose from. The only possible change they can bring is to get in Jamie Overton in place of Brydon Carse. The latter did have had a good T20I series but was put to the sword in the first ODI coming in as first change.
India predicted Playing XI for first ODI vs England: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravindra Jadeja, Harshit Rana, Mohammad Shami, Varun Chakaravarthy.

England Playing XI for first ODI vs India: Ben Duckett, Philip Salt(w), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler(c), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood

Title: New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra goes off field injured after getting hit on face with ball in Kiwis win over Pakistan in Tri Series opener
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rachin-ravindra-face-injury-new-zealand-vs-pakistan-tri-series-9825508/
Content:
New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra suffered an injury on Saturday in the Tri-Series opener vs Pakistan when a ball hit him straight on the face while fielding. The incident occurred in the 38th over of Pakistan’s chase when Khushdil Shah tried a slog sweep off a Michael Bracewell delivery which went straight to Ravindra.
The Kiwi player tried to take the catch but ended up misjudging it and he got hit straight on his face which led to him bleeding and then leaving the field. While leaving, his face was covered with a towel by the physio in order to stop the bleeding.
In the match, Glenn Phillips warmed up for the Champions Trophy with his first one-day international century as New Zealand beat Pakistan by 78 runs.
A tough moment on the field for Rachin Ravindra as an attempted catch turned into an unfortunate injury. 🤕
Get well soon, Rachin! pic.twitter.com/34dB108tpF
— FanCode (@FanCode) February 8, 2025
Phillips smashed an unbeaten 106 off 74 balls, including six boundaries and seven sixes, at a newly renovated Gaddafi Stadium. The No. 6 batter propelled New Zealand to 330-6 in its 50 overs on a flat wicket with Daryl Mitchell (81) and Kane Williamson (58) also getting the feel of the wickets for the upcoming Champions Trophy with half centuries.
In reply, Fakhar Zaman, playing his first international in more than seven months because of illness, made a belligerent 84 off 69 but the rest of the top-order batters struggled against spin.
Pakistan was bowled out for 252 in 47.5 overs.
Phillips capped a perfect day by trapping Zaman leg before wicket with his off-spin and also took a brilliant diving catch to dismiss Babar Azam early in Pakistan’s run chase.
Babar struggled in his new role as opener in ODIs for the first time since 2015 and scored a painstaking 10 runs off 23 balls.

New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner (3-41) clipped the top-order with his left-arm spin while Bracewell took 2-41. Fast bowler Matt Henry chipped in with 3-55.
No. 10 batter Abrar Ahmed hit an unbeaten 25 that included three successive boundaries off Henry.

Title: Son of fisherman, Kerala’s MD Nidheesh grabs a five-for to rattle Jammu & Kashmir in Ranji Trophy quarter final
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/md-nidheesh-five-for-jammu-kashmir-fisherman-son-ranji-9825372/
Content:
It’s unclear why Jammu & Kashmir chose Pune’s misty MCA stadium as their preferred venue for the Ranji quarterfinals. But Mattakandathil Dineshan (MD) Nidheesh knew his ears pricked up when he heard Kerala would travel away from the usually preferred flat wickets or turners, aiming for the semifinal.
Nidheesh, the right-arm outswing specialist conjuring wicked angles, knew he was On. His time to strike, was now.
MCA’s serene field and spicy pitch have plenty of fans in both Ranji teams, notably their quicks. “This was like heaven for us!” Nidheesh would say after his 5-for 56 from 23 overs, regularly stubbed out flickers that J&K batsmen lit, while reaching 228/8 in 85 overs on Day 1.
It wasn’t just the 5 wickets and the fact that he put in 27 percent of the overs Kerala bowled, maintaining impressive stump-to-stump discipline with variations thrown in when least expected. It was the fact that he removed four dangerous J&K batsmen, right when they were threatening to let loose.
Seasoned opener Shubham Khajuria was looking extremely comfortable on 14 off 19 when Nidheesh rushed one onto him and had him evading to Sachin Baby at second slip. Nidheesh named the strokemaking Yawer Hassan Khan his favourite snare. “He was starting to dominate our bowlers, reading pace and movement real well, building good momentum,” Nidheesh explained of the U23’s off-stump he sent flying with one that jagged sharply on 25 off 65. “I bowled in the right areas to him, and our set-up plan worked well,” he said as J&K faltered to 48/3, their safe tenacious approach cleaved open.
J&K wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhawan was lured into an uppish drive for 48 ending a crucial 55 run partnership after 115 wicketless deliveries. Then, when Nasir Lone, batting at No 7 counter attacked for 44 off 97, Nidheesh struck again – right after an intentfully punched 4, getting an edge off a full-length yorker this time.
Kerala have backed their offies Jalaj Saxena (season’s lead wicket taker with 33, but wicketless on Day 1) and Aditya Sarwate (23 wickets) to get them wins. But Pune with its post-moisture eccentricity rewards quicks. “Initially there was nothing even when wet, but the bounce picked up progressively. I just bowled in right areas, not trying unnecessary things and was disciplined,” Nidheesh described the whimmy wizardry of the track.
He credited Kerala batsmen for bolstering his determination. “In the Kerala nets we bowl to Sachin Baby, Md Azharudeen, Jalaj bhaiyya and Shoun Roger. They are brilliant batters and to get them out in the nets is tough,” he said.
Nidheesh, who set up the MP win for Kerala, started cricket rather late at 17. He belonged to an impoverished fisher-community from Kanjiramattom of Ernakulam, 35 km away from Kochi, and knew nothing of cricket till he watched S Sreesanth win the 2007 T20 World Cup, firing his imagination. “Sreesanth’s debut and World Cup magic spell inspired me. I come from a rural village, where even Kochi is far,” he recalled, adding he played a spot of football, but nothing serious.
Subsequent coaches have praised him for his ability to bowl long spells and keep learning – from Dav Whatmore to local mentors Sony Cheruvathur and MA Sunil. He sharpened his bowling brain working with Tinu Yohannan, Sreesanth, Lasith Malinga, Shane Bond and admired Mustafizur, always craving a variety of tricks. “Last season Chandu Pandit Sir helped,” he recalls.
But the patience was honed when very young and far from cricket. His father was a clam shell harvester, and that typically is a tedious process with the whole family working hard, though with limited returns. Harvesting involves diving and raking out 30-40 cms from lake beds, boiling the clams over fire, sieving them to separate shells from meat – and it courts toxicity as a professional hazard due to the state of shallow waters. Mining departments typically oversee the vocation, not fisheries.
Clams are not oysters, so the world wasn’t magnificently opening up for him. Nidheesh barely noticed anything outside raking up sea shallows – that included ignorance of cricket, hence the late start at 17. He needed to travel nearly 20 km to Tripunithura Palace Oval grounds to understand all the fuss and frenzy about cricket’s fast bowling.
He simplifies his community’s back-breaking existence. “Financial struggles were big. My dad was a fisherman and my mother sold fish, so it was daily wages. But they ensured they paid my first fees for a cricket camp,” he says, now happily immersed in the sport. On Saturday, he baited and netted J&K’s big fish, like a proper angler.

Brief scores J&K 228 for 8 (Wadhawan 48, Nidheesh 5/56)

Title: Rohit Sharma’s strengths have become weaknesses; can he turn it around at Cuttack in second ODI against England?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-ind-vs-eng-cuttack-2nd-odi-virat-kohli-9825275/
Content:
After swooping up tickets for another international cricket fixture, only 500 meters out across the road from their sandy cricket arena on the Mahanadi river bank, Ramesh and his team are wrapping up play when the question of watching a one-dayer at Cuttack’s Barabati Stadium after six years is posed.
“Six years? No, no. We have hosted a lot more matches since then. 2019 was definitely not the last game,” responds Ramesh. Smug-faced, he claims he has not “missed a single game” at the ground in 10 years.
The affable resistance to the fact that only a solitary T20I has been played at the venue since the last ODI here in 2019 is, of course, rooted in the pride of their home venue. The situation isn’t entirely different inside the stadium, where a seasoned local media person, “Munna saab”, echoes a similar sentiment. “Kya baat kar rahe ho bhai? There have been so many international games here since then. The last one was in 2022 but this is not the first ODI since 2019,” he said, refusing to acknowledge the record books.
India captain Rohit Sharma ran a similar strain of stubbornness earlier this week as he addressed concerns about his form before the first ODI in Nagpur. An unusually miffed Rohit would object to mixing formats, affirming this is “a different format, a different time.”
But with his wrists and eyes failing him early, tempting him to a loose chip that was gulped down by the mid-wicket fielder for two runs at his hometown on Thursday, a tentative Rohit will know his downtime can only be flipped by a decisive score in the second ODI against England at the Barabati on Sunday afternoon.
Swanked by the Mahanadi delta waters from three directions, the Barabati’s surroundings form a cruel metaphor for Rohit’s distending concerns against the red, pink, and white balls within his last six competitive outings.
Form and the three formats may not have a solid binding like Rohit suggested, but a recurring pattern of dismissals in which he falls caught within the inner circle will play on the back of his mind.
Since the Wankhede Test against New Zealand last year, six of his 10 dismissals across conditions have occurred at the cost of trademark Rohit strokes – the flick and the pull – within the 30-yard marker. England pacer Saqib Mahmood dealt the latest blow with an inswinger that swerved past the leg-stump. Rohit’s half-hearted chip, lacking conviction and power, landed straight in Liam Livingstone’s hands, marking a third dismissal of the type at mid-wicket since November 2024.
Committing too early or reacting late to deliveries on length, Rohit’s perils have also witnessed poorly-timed flicks or pulls edged to the slip cordon, mid-off, and mid-on fielders.
For a batter who had once remarked being “pumped up” at the prospect of facing the first ball, the lack of clarity may have prevented Rohit from taking guard against the opening delivery for the first time since August 2019 in the previous outing.
“If you look at it from Rohit’s point of view, then obviously, it is frustrating for him,” former India spinner R Ashwin reflected on Rohit on his YouTube channel.
“He thinks that he has done well in the format (ODI) and he’d like to continue that. It’s a catch-22 situation. You can’t stop these questions. When will they stop? When he performs,” Ashwin added.
While the batting conundrum persists, Rohit will also have to contain a minor spill-over from the leadership standpoint after Shreyas Iyer’s earnest post-match chat in Nagpur. Iyer’s admission that he would have been benched for Yashasvi Jaiswal had Virat Kohli not turned up injured for the first ODI raised eyebrows while offering another peek into the current management’s firm emphasis on the left-right batting combination.
With Kohli recovering from his right knee swelling and sweating it out before an unusually jam-packed crowd in the stands for Saturday’s practice session, it will be interesting if Rohit and Co. continue with the Jaiswal strategy upfront at the expense of an in-form Iyer.
“The lefty-righty combination definitely has to be there but that’s a decision for the head coach and captain to take,” batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said with carefully constructed words on match eve.
Turning up for his first white-ball game in six months after a lowly red-ball stretch like Rohit, Kohli too would be raring to regain the spirits from his beloved 50-over format. Cuttack has offered similar jump-starts to ageing units in the past too. The 2017 clash between India and England at this venue proved decisive in reviving old warhorses Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni in the running for another Champions Trophy. As Yuvraj romped to his highest score (150), Dhoni, fresh from relinquishing captaincy, scored his final ODI ton that evening.
History throws up hope. But Rohit has a heightened challenge – “catch 22” as Ashwin puts it – in overcoming his current technical deficiencies while also handling tactical curveballs like the Shreyas Iyer/left-hander situation.

Title: ‘No real concern about his form’: Sitanshu Kotak on Rohit Sharma’s recent lean patch
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/rohit-sharma-form-no-real-concer-sitanshu-kotak-ind-eng-9825214/
Content:
India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak downplayed concerns on skipper Rohit Sharma’s recent lean patch, saying that his ODI form before the England series speaks for itself. “I personally don’t see any issue with his form. In his last three ODIs, Rohit has scored 56, 64, and 35,” Kotak said in the pre-match press conference in Cuttack on Saturday.
“That means he has been averaging over 50 in those matches. We are talking about a player who has 31 ODI centuries. When someone keeps scoring, no one questions when they will fail,” Kotak added.
Rohit has struggled to find his rhythm in recent matches with his dismal performances in the New Zealand and Australia Tests bleeding into the 1st ODI vs England in Nagpur where he lasted just 7 balls and scored 2. Over his last 16 innings across formats, Rohit has accumulated only 166 runs at an average of 10.37, with just one half-century.
“Sometimes, a player might have a lean patch, but that doesn’t worry me. Yes, in the Australia Test match, it was tough, and he got out early, but in ODIs, he has been performing consistently. So, there’s no real concern about his form,” the India batting coach said.
With the Champions Trophy set to begin on February 19 in Dubai and Pakistan, Kotak expressed confidence about their preparation.
“The entire team looks solid. Whether there is any experiment, new players will come to the XI or some senior players will be left out. It’s the head coach and captain who will discuss and they will decide. So, I don’t think I can make any comment on that.”
On Mohammed Shami’s fitness, Kotak reassured that the pacer was “completely fit”. Shami returned to the International cricket in the preceding T20I series after a 14-month injury layoff.

Asked whether Arshdeep Singh might get a chance, he repeated, “That decision lies with the head coach and captain.” Regarding Jasprit Bumrah’s injury status, he admitted he was unaware of the scan results. “That’s something the physio would know,” he signed off.

Title: Graeme Smith, Virat Kohli…Steve Smith: Check out list the Australian stand-in skipper in match vs SL made progress in
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/graeme-smith-virat-kohli-steve-smith-check-out-list-the-australian-stand-in-skipper-in-match-vs-sl-made-progress-in-9825115/
Content:
Australian stand-in skipper Steven Smith scored back-to-back tons during the ongoing series against Sri Lanka in Galle. The 35-year-old now has piled on 36 tons in his Test career. He is fifth on the all-time list and is only behind the likes of Kumar Sangakkara, Ricky Ponting, Jacques Kallis and Sachin Tendulkar.
In addition to that Smith’s ton in Galle is 17th away from excluding his tons at neutral venues. He has got the most centuries away for an Australian batter.
In addition to that he is now placed fourth on the list of most tons as a captain in the red-ball format. Graeme Smith tops the list with 25 tons and India’s Virat Kohli is second with 20 tons.
Australian Head Coach Andrew McDonald revealed that it is “heavily unlikely” that Pat Cummins would be participating in the upcoming Champions Trophy. And there are discussions to make either Travis Head or Steven Smith captain of the side for the tournament.
“Pat Cummins hasn’t been able to resume any type of bowling so he’s heavily unlikely, so that would mean that we do need a captain,” McDonald told SEN. “Steve Smith and Travis Head are the two that we’ve been having conversations with while we’ve been building out that Champions Trophy team along with Pat back home. They’ll be the two that we look at for that leadership post.”
“They’re the two obvious ones. Steve has done a great job here in the [first] Test match. He’s done some good work in one-day international cricket across the journey as well. So it’s between those two,” McDonald Said.

Title: What is ‘khhauw-raas’, ‘Ba_kar batting’? Jammu & Kashmir fan in Pune on joy of travelling for Ranji Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/jammu-and-kashmir-fan-pune-ranji-trophy-match-joys-9825141/
Content:
For a cricket stadium that really tests fan-love by keeping its access-ways narrow and the stands uncovered, the neutral MCA stadium managed a godly crowd of around 100 for a Ranji game not involving Maharashtra. Surprisingly most was partisan. Unsurprisingly, the teams were Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir, who always attract their domestic diaspora, dispersed across the country, and turn up to cheer their team.
But a Baramulla cricket fan Sheikh Gulzar took passionate following to the next level, as he came all the way leaving behind 6-7 inches snow and chill at home, for a 32 degrees, dusty sunny Pune – only to follow his team’s progress.
Ask him if it’s a surprise J&K topped the group. And he retorts, “We are a good hard-working team, not in quarters just by luck. Sabko haraayenge (We will beat everyone)” he says in soft-spoken bravado.
The textile merchant from Kashmir, has a cousin in Pune. But his immediate cricket connection is J&K all-rounder Aquib Nabi, his next door neighbour. Following his promising career, and taking in the heights of Parvez Rasool’s peak career, Sheikh always found himself excuses to travel around the country following his team. “Mumbai of course, but Jaipur, Chandigarh, Delhi in previous seasons and Jammu this one,” he recalls. “You can say I’m crazy about cricket since the day I started understanding the game.”
Ranji teams are accustomed to empty stadia, but Sheikh Gulzar is glad he’s in the midst of a crowd that is invested in state loyalties, even if he’s outnumbered by 50-odd Kerala supporters. The first day has seen J&K struggle to string together a big partnership but that is no deterrent to the Kashmiri hopeful of a fightback.
“Final jaa sakte hai kya….hum final laa sakte hai!” he declares, even as his family, a sister, brother-in-law and two cricket-mad children refuse to leave, even if lunch food stalls aren’t closeby for fans. “I wish there was a canteen, but it’s fine. We’re here for the team. Following Ranji can’t be about luxury,” he notes, even as he hopes for a similar big stadium in Srinagar.
He gazes around the stadium and at the iconic hillock of MCA, and says, “Home is just like this, but the green expanse of the ground is how all of J&K is. Green grass carpets, but natural. Switzerland feeka pad jaega uske saamne ( … will pale)”.
He grew up a Ricky Ponting and MS Dhoni fan, and insists the whole family love cricket because there’s no better ‘spiritual experience’ he says. But funding these trips? “We work our asses off the whole year so that we can take this one month off for cricket. It’s our annual vacation. We have lots of talent back home, but the team needs fans supporting them everywhere,” he says.
He can literally cross the threshold and get autographs from the team, but he taught his children to earn autographs on the ground. “Ground pe autograph ka mazaa kuchh aur hi hai,” he says.
His Pune trip, living in the city, has been about visiting malls and Dilli Darbar, as he leaves thoughts of elaborate waazwan meal for home. “It’s good to experience different flavours, see a different culture,” he says.

He does tip off about a different flavour of pitch-talk that one can expect when J&K bowl. The enunciation is tough in English, he says, but do watch out for “cha_kar bowling” and “Ba_kar batting” (roughly ‘lets go’) and “laagiye” – what wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhawan is expected to yap when batters charge out the crease. But the best cue is “khhauw-raas” hissed with a menace – signalling a yorker, about to be unleashed, and imminently incoming. Sometimes even the Jammu folk in the team don’t get that code. The stumps do the singing. “And then the batsman knows.”

Title: ‘Virat Kohli is fit and available for selection’: India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak ahead of 2nd ODI vs ENG
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/virat-kohli-fit-available-selection-sitanshu-kotak-ind-vs-eng-9825114/
Content:
India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak on Saturday bore good news for the Indian team and its fans as he confirmed star batter Virat Kohli was fit and available for selection for the second ODI match against England at Cuttack on Sunday. ‘Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,” Kotak said in the pre-match press conference ahead of the match.
Kohli had missed out of the 1st ODI in Nagpur due to a knee injury, skipper Rohit Sharma had said at the toss before the first of the three matches between India and England. “Virat Kohli was unavailable for selection for the 1st ODI due to a sore right knee,” the BCCI had posted on the day of the match.
With Kohli available, it throws up a dilemma for the Indian team management on who will he will replace in the playing 11. In the last match, Shreyas Iyer, came in for Kohli at the last minute by his own admission, and made a rollicking 36-ball 59 that has made dropping him an almost unthinkable act.
“It is captain (Rohit Sharma) and coach’s (Gautam Gambhir) call. I can’t answer this,” Kotak replied when he was asked on if Shreyas or Yashasvi Jaiswal will make way for Kohli.
Combination questions apart, Kohli too is in need of runs, and he will need a good outing here if he indeed makes a return. Kohli’s form has been under scrutiny in recent months, especially after his struggles in Australia, where he repeatedly nicked deliveries to the slip cordon or wicketkeeper.
His last competitive outing — for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy— too was a low-yielding one, managing just six before getting bowled by Railways pacer Himanshu Sangwan.

But One-day cricket is Kohli’s staple format, and the 36-year-old needs just 94 runs to become the third batter to reach 14,000 runs in the format after Sachin Tendulkar (18,426) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) Having played 283 ODI innings, Kohli can also become the fastest to this milestone ahead of Tendulkar (350 innings) and Sangakkara (378).

Title: WATCH: Dimuth Karunaratne walks back for the last time in Tests to applause from Australia players
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dimuth-karunaratne-last-test-100th-applause-australia-srilanka-9825056/
Content:
Sri Lankan opener Dimuth Karunaratne left the field of his last Test match to a standing ovation by the Australians in the 3rd day of the 2nd Test. The Lankan player, who was also playing his 100th Test match, scored just 14 runs in the second innings before he nicked one behind to wicketkeeper Alex Carey off Matthew Kuhnemann.
Before walking off, he shook hands with Nathan Lyon and Steve Smith and shared a hug with long time batting partner Dinesh Chandimal even as the Aussie players stopped celebrating and applauded him. The Sri Lankan batter scored 7222 runs in 100 Tests at an average of 39.25 with 16 centuries and 39 fifties with a high score of 244 runs.
On Thursday, Karunaratne became the seventh Sri Lanka cricketer to reach the 100-Test milestone after current head coach Sanath Jayasuriya (110), Muttiah Muralidaran (132), Chaminda Vaas (111), Kumar Sangakkara (134), Mahela Jayawardena (149), and Angelo Mathews (117).

— 7Cricket (@7Cricket) February 8, 2025
Karunaratne’s 16 Test tons are the joint-fourth for Sri Lanka alongside Marvan Atapattu, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dinesh Chandimal and Mathews. Only Sangakkara (38), Jayawardena (34) and Arjun Ranatunga (20) have accorded more centuries in the format.
Earlier in the day, Australia were edging towards a 2-0 series sweep over Sri Lanka after Alex Carey’s breathtaking century moved the visitors into a formidable position in the second test.
On Day 3, the visitors racked up an imposing 414 before being bowled out just before lunch, securing a first-innings lead of 157 runs.
Sri Lanka lost the first test by an innings and 242 runs, also in Galle — Sri Lanka’s worst defeat in test cricket
Carey was in scintillating touch, showcasing his mastery of the sweep shot to counter Sri Lanka’s spin-heavy attack. As the hosts attempted to stifle the scoring by crowding the leg-side, Carey responded with audacious reverse sweeps, keeping the bowlers on the back foot.
In the process, the Australian wicketkeeper carved out a career-best 156, the highest score by an Australian glove man in Asia, eclipsing Adam Gilchrist’s 144.

Steve Smith, too, made his presence felt with a well-compiled 131 — his second century of the series. However, unlike Carey’s assured stroke play, Smith had a few nervous moments early on. Once settled, though, he dug in, contributing to a mammoth 259-run partnership for the fourth wicket — the highest stand at that position by a visiting team in Sri Lanka.

Title: AB de Villiers hopes to see ‘more Indian friends’ play in SA20, calls for women’s T20 league in South Africa
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ab-de-villiers-hopes-to-see-more-indian-friends-play-in-sa20-calls-for-womens-t20-league-in-south-africa-9825073/
Content:
Participation of India’s male cricketers in leagues outside the IPL is still not a reality but in the ongoing SA20 – South Africa’s franchise-based T20 tournament – the recently retired Dinesh Karthik made his debut. It is something AB de Villiers hopes to see more of, as the South African stalwart hoped to see more Indian players take part in the league in the near future.
“I have no idea whether it is going to work or not. The BCCI is the most powerful board and they know what they are doing They make the decision on behalf of the players and on behalf of the business they are running. So, it’s not easy for them to just release their players,” De Villers is quoted as saying by PTI in a media interaction ahead of the SA20 final between MI CapeTown and Sunrisers Eastern Cape.
“This year we had Robin Uthappa (former India batter) in the commentary box and Dinesh Karthik played for Paarl Royals. I really wish that we can have more Indian friends playing here. I can see it happening but it’s not going to happen next season. It is going to take time,” he said.
The BCCI restricts India’s active male cricketers from playing leagues other than the IPL to retain exclusivity. While the leading female cricketers take part in tournaments like WBBL, The Hundred and Carribean Premier League, only retired male players can participate in leagues other than IPL.
Incidentally, De Villiers also mooted the idea of a women’s SA20 league too. “I have seen some very successful women’s leagues, the incredibly successful women’s T20WC that South Africa played not very long ago. Women’s cricket in general is growing incredibly fast and there is no reason why there shouldn’t be an SA20 women’s league,” the former SA captain said. “We can pace up as we have got the model and recipe, we can just copy and paste and it would be great for women’s game in the country,” he said. South African women have reached the final of the last two editions of the T20 World Cup as well as the recent U19 World Cup where they lost to India in the title cash.

Title: India vs England 2nd ODI Match: Squad, Pitch-Weather Report, other details
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-2nd-odi-date-time-squad-pitch-report-weather-update-9824829/
Content:
India will take on England in the second of the three-match ODI series on Sunday at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack. The hosts won the opening game in Nagpur by four wickets to take 1-0 lead in the series.
Apart from a few jitters at the start of both batting and bowling innings India has looked like well-oiled machine. With the ball they could restrict England to a decent total and they chased it down with more than 11 overs to spare. England on the other hand, had to face the same issues which they have faced in T20I series which is not able to find a method of scoring runs against spinners.
India predicted XI: Rohit Sharma (C), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Varun Chakarvarthy, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Shami
Player to watch out for: Rohit in the first game fell for another low score. However, more than the score it is the way he got out would be more concerning. He looked out of rhythm and his technique looked a touch rusty yet again. Going into the Champions Trophy regardless of how the innings would look aesthetically Rohit would need some runs behind his back just to give himself confidence.
England predicted XI: Ben Duckett, Phil Salt (WK), Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jos Buttler (C), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood
Player to watch out for: All eyes will be on Joe Root for England. For the brief time he was batting at the crease in Nagpur, Root looked solid. His rotatiton of strike and ability to pick on the loose balls of spinners to put the pressure back on is text book way of dealing the middle overs in sub-continent.
Squads
India Squad: Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja
England Squad: Harry Brook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell, Liam Livingstone, Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Jos Buttler, Jamie Smith, Philip Salt, Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Adil Rashid, Saqib Mahmood, Mark Wood
India vs England head-to-head records in ODIs
Matches played: 108, India won: 59, England won: 44
India vs England Pitch Report
Similar to Nagpur, Cuttack is another pitch which will help the tweakers. In addition to that the bounce too is lower in Cuttack, hence the batting for the England is not going to get any easier. The likes of Ravindra Jadeja who is deadly accurate can exploit the surface and trouble the English batters yet again.
India vs England Weather Report
The temperature for Sunday is 33 degree centigrade during the day time and it falls down to 19 degree centigrade in the evening. The games in Cuttack in the past have seen heavy dew hence the team winning the toss will look to bowl first and use the slowness of the wicket in first innings and as the dew sets enjoy the batting conditions in second.
India vs England live streaming details
The 2nd ODI between India and England will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network. The match will also be available for live streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.

Title: Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif: ‘Real task now is to not only win Champions Trophy but also beat India in Dubai’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-shehbaz-sharif-real-task-now-is-to-not-only-win-champions-trophy-but-also-beat-india-in-dubai-9824783/
Content:
Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that Mohammad Rizwan-led team’s real task is not only to win the Champions Trophy but also beat India in Dubai on February 23. Pakistan are the host of the Champions Trophy. India refused to send their team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. The recent tense relations between the two cricket boards has spiced up the February 23 match.
“We have a very good side and they have done well in recent times but the real task now is to not only win the Champions Trophy but also defeat our arch-rival, India in the upcoming match in Dubai. The entire nation stands behind them,” Sharif said at the inauguration ceremony of the renovated and upgraded Gaddafi stadium.
Pakistan are also the defending champions. They have defeated India in the final in 2017. Pakistan’s last win in an ICC event against India came in 2021 when they won in Dubai in the T20 World Cup.
“It is a big occasion for Pakistan that we are hosting a big ICC event after nearly 29 years,” Sharif said.
“I have full confidence that our team will continue to make the nation proud in the upcoming Champions Trophy.”
The Pakistan Cricket Board has upgraded three stadiums — at Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi — for the Champions Trophy.
It’s a busy time for Pakistan cricket. The 35,000-capacity Gaddafi stadium has been upgraded in less than four months for the country’s first major ICC tournament in 29 years when it will host the eight-nation Champions Trophy, starting February 19.
Archrival India is the only participating team which will not travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy. Instead, India will play all its games in Dubai, including the marquee group match between Pakistan and India on February 23. The March 9 final will also be played at Dubai if India is one of the teams.

Title: ‘I felt like I was very privileged to be in the squad’: Sam Konstas after returning from Sri Lanka
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-felt-like-i-was-very-privileged-to-be-in-the-squad-sam-konstas-after-returning-from-sri-lanka-9824712/
Content:
19-year-old Sam Konstas made a remarkable debut when he scooped Jasprit Bumrah in the Border Gavaskar Trophy. His innings in the fourth Test in Melbourne essentially set the tone in the Test match and rattled Bumrah in the opening burst. Konstas does feel it was a privilege for him to be part of the squad then.
However, despite him having a good series in Australia Konstas would not picked in the playing XI for series in Sri Lanka.
“I felt like I was very privileged to be in the squad. And obviously learning from the best players like Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Usman Khawaja and how their methods are different in those conditions. I learnt quite a bit. I understood the reasons why,” Konstas said CODE sport.
“For me, it is just a great learning curve and if I do get another opportunity with the Test team I will grab it with both hands. I understand why Travis Head opened the batting because he is a legend of the game and he has been dominating,” he added.
Earlier After being dropped from the Australian XI from the first Test against Sri Lanka, 19-year-old Australian sensation Sam Konstas has flown back to Sydney prior to the second Test against the hosts starting this week.
“That’s the plan. Hopefully, I can be back for the first game (NSW vs Queensland on Saturday),” Konstas told The Age while speaking at the team hotel in Galle when asked about his plans after reaching Sydney.
Former Australian wicket-keeper Brad Haddin earlier had suggested that the 19-year-old opener should be sent home if he is not to be given a chance in the second Test.
“We’ve got to remember he (Konstas) is 19, so if they’re not using him for the second Test I would send him home to play state cricket. He hasn’t played a lot [of first-class cricket] and the more he plays the better. He would’ve had a good couple of weeks over there [in Sri Lanka] learning. If he’s not going to be needed, send him back home to bat,” Haddin had told Australian media.

Title: Sunil Gavaskar slams KL Rahul for his dismissal in 1st IND vs ENG ODI
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sunil-gavaskar-slams-kl-rahul-for-his-dismissal-in-1st-ind-vs-eng-odi-9824578/
Content:
India was in a dominant position in the first game when KL Rahul walked in. At the time Shubman Gill was also closing in on a century however, in his attempts to take singles and give the strike back to Gill, Rahul lost his wicket when he pushed the ball and it went straight into the hands of Adil Rashid. Former Sunil Gavaskar insisted that Rahul should have played his “natural game.”
“He needs to play his natural game. He was trying to nudge the ball to give his partner a chance to score a century. But look what happened. This is a team game, and there’s no need to do that. He was more focused on helping his partner reach a milestone than playing his own game. It was a half-hearted shot,” Gavaskar commented.
However, once Rahul fell, Hardik Pandya came in and looked to accelerate the innings and take India over the line as quickly as possible. Gill in attempt to get his ton quickly pulled a ball and was caught at mid-on for 89 and missed his century anyway.
While there are two school of thoughts whom of Rishabh Pant or KL Rahul should play in the middle order former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra would opt for Rahul.
“There are two schools of thought. One is that you have all right-handers, Shubman Gill is there with Rohit Sharma, then Virat Kohli, Rahul, and Hardik Pandya. So don’t you want a left-hander there? People who come with that thinking are saying Rishabh Pant should be played,” Chopra said on his YouTube channel.
“What goes in KL Rahul’s favour is what wrong has he done. Just because his name is Rahul, will you keep drumming him? Will you keep getting him to do all the jobs, whether it’s keeping, going down or up the order, and serving the drinks? No, that’s not going to happen,” he added. “He played well in the World Cup. I still remember the Australia match at Chepauk. Then he continuously scored alright. He was criticized a lot for batting a little slow in the final, but we might not have reached where we reached if he had gotten out instead of batting slow,” Chopra explained.

Title: ‘King kar lega’: Mohammad Rizwan on who will open for Pakistan in Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/king-kar-lega-mohammad-rizwan-on-who-will-open-for-pakistan-in-champions-trophy-9824517/
Content:
Pakistan captain Mohammed Rizwan reveals who will open for Pakistan in the upcoming Champions Trophy. In the absence of injured Saim Ayub, Pakistan has slotted its premier batter Babar Azam as one of the opening options with recalled Fakhar Zaman in both the tri-series and the Champions Trophy.
When asked who will open for Pakistan, Rizwan said: King kar le ga.”
One of the world’s most prolific ODI batters in his usual No. 3 spot, Babar has played just two games as an opener in his glittering one-day international career. Ayub was ruled out of the Champions Trophy after fracturing his right ankle during a test match against South Africa last month.
“Look, we all know how well Saim Ayub performed recently. It was exceptional, considering the conditions and oppositions he flared against,” said Rizwan.
“Anyway, his void is in the team because he is such a package for Pakistan who can be fit anywhere be it his bowling, fielding or batting.
“You can also that our planning got disturbed but we should not be focusing on the names but on the process.
“So, his void is there but the process remained the same for us and it will not be an excuse for us.”
Rizwan also cleared air on the selection of all-rounder Faheem Ashraf ahead of Aamir Jamal.
“If you talk about Faheem Ashraf, his performance over the last two years has been good. His List-A average is around 46,” said Rizwan.
“Look, sometimes people think about how a certain player is making his comeback after a few years, but we make decisions considering the team requirements.”
“We needed a fast-bowling all-rounder while Aamir Jamal was also a consideration but he [Faheem] was the best choice for us,” explained Rizwan.
“As for Khushdil Shah, he is in exceptional form, if you have watched BPL and Champions Cup. His performance is in front of everyone and I think, it should not be questioned.”
Pakistan squad for tri-nation series, Champions Trophy 2025
Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Mohammad Rizwan (c)(wk), Usman Khan (wk), Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Salman Ali Agha (vc), Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi.

Title: R Ashwin on Rohit Sharma’s critics: ‘When will they stop? When he performs’
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/r-ashwin-on-rohit-sharmas-critics-when-will-they-stop-when-he-performs-9824348/
Content:
Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has raised concern over Rohit Sharma’s current form and said the Team India captain must silence his critics with his performance with the bat. After an abysmal Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he dropped himself from the final Test in Sydney. However, Rohit’s poor form continues as he managed on two runs in the opening game of the three-match ODI series in Nagpur.
“This is not easy. If you look at it from Rohit’s point of view, then obviously, it is frustrating form him,” Ashwin said on his Youtube channel.
“He needs to concentrate on the series. He thinks that he have done well in the format and he’d like to continue that.
“But people will ask questions. The ones who are watching will obviously ask.
“It’s a catch-22 situation. You can’t stop these questions. When will they stop? When he performs,” he said.
Earlier this week, Rohit Sharma didn’t seem too pleased with questions on his current form and his future after the ICC Champions Trophy in the press conference on the eve of the first ODI against England in Nagpur.
“What kind of a question is that? This is a different format, a different time. As usual, as cricketers, we know there will be ups and downs and I have faced a lot in my career, so this is nothing new to me. We know every day is a fresh day, every series is a fresh series,” Rohit shot back.
It was unlike any Rohit press conference one has seen over the years. Even after India were bowled out for 46 against New Zealand last year, the India captain had come for the presser and answered all questions coolly.
“How is it relevant that I talk about my future plans sitting here when there are three ODIs and a Champions Trophy coming up. Reports have been going around for a number of years, but I am not here to clarify those reports. For me, these three games and the Champions Trophy are very important, so my focus is on these games. We will see what happens afterwards,” Rohit had said.
India will play their second match against England in Cuttack on Sunday.

Title: Pat Cummins and wife Becky welcome their second child
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pat-cummins-and-wife-becky-welcome-their-second-child-9824287/
Content:
Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins and his wife Becky have announced their second child, a baby girl named Edith. The Cummins family announced news of their first pregnancy with son Albie on Instagram in 2021.
“She’s here,” Becky Cummins posted on Instagram with a picture of the newborn.  “Our beautiful baby girl, Edi … Words can’t describe how overjoyed & full of love we feel right now.”

A post shared by Rebecca Jane Cummins (@becky_cummins)
Due to an ankle injury and the birth of his second child, Cummins has been not selected for the ongoing Australia’s two-match Test series against Sri Lanka. Smith has been given the reigns.
Cummins has also been ruled out of next month’s Champions Trophy in Pakistan as he’s managing an injury.
Cummins hasn’t been able to resume training after he missed the Test series in Sri Lanka due to the birth of his second child, while also nursing an ankle problem, which flared up during the gruelling five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.
“Pat Cummins hasn’t been able to resume any type of bowling so he’s heavily unlikely, so that would mean that we do need a captain,” Head coach Andrew McDonald told SEN Radio.
“Steve Smith and Travis Head are the two that we’ve been having conversations with while we’ve been building out that Champions Trophy team along with Pat (Cummins) back home. They’ll be the two that we look at for that leadership post,” added McDonald.
The Champions Trophy will be held in Pakistan and UAE beginning February 19 in Karachi.
Australia has released a squad with both Hazlewood and Cummins in it for Champions Trophy 2025. However according to the rules the squads can be tweaked in till February 12.
Squad: Alex Carey (wicketkeeper), Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Matthew Short, Steven Smith, Aaron Hardie, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Pat Cummins (captain), Nathan Ellis, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa

PAK vs NZ ODI Tri-Series Live Score Streaming: Mohammad Rizwan-led Pakistan will lock horns against Mitchell Santner’s New Zealand in the first match of the tri-series at the newly upgraded Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. The third team in the tournament is South Africa.
In the absence of injured Saim Ayub, Pakistan has slotted its premier batter Babar Azam as one of the opening options with recalled Fakhar Zaman in both the tri-series and the Champions Trophy. Ayub was ruled out of the Champions Trophy after fracturing his right ankle during a test match against South Africa last month.
New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner hopes former captain Kane Williamson will provide New Zealand enough cushion in the middle-order but was wary of Zaman’s big-hitting upfront which saw Pakistan beating New Zealand in a high-scoring World Cup match at Bangalore in 2023. “He’s (Zaman) a problem for us,” Santner said. “He likes playing New Zealand. I think he’s got runs every time he’s played us … we know how good he is along with a lot of their top six, top seven (batters). We know it’s going to be a challenge, but we are ready.”
The Pakistan vs New Zealand will be taking place on Saturday (February 8).
The Pakistan vs New Zealand match will start at 2:30 PM IST. The toss will take place at 2 PM IST.
The first ODI of the tri-series between Pakistan and New Zealand is scheduled to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
Sony Sports Network has the broadcasting rights for the forthcoming PAK vs NZ ODI, The series will be televised live on Sony Sports channels in India.
The live streaming for the Pakistan vs New Zealand match will be available on the JioTV app in India.
Pakistan Squad: Fakhar Zaman, Khushdil Shah, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan (C & WK), Salman Agha, Kamran Ghulam, Tayyab Tahir, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Hasnain, Usman Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Saud Shakeel.

Title: Why Jadeja and Axar are better ODI options than Varun Chakaravarthy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ravindra-jadeja-and-axar-patel-never-club-them-together-never-write-them-off-9824111/
Content:
Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel possess cricket skills that get labelled similarly. But that’s like confusing tomato sauce for ketchup. Or a crow for a raven. It needs an expert eye and nose for nuance to appreciate the difference between the all-format multi-skilled cricketers. They have the same font but Jadeja is italicized.
To bracket them as a fastish spinner is to dovetail Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Shami as identical 140 plus quicks. The taller Axar banks on bounce and drift. Jadeja, easily the better-skilled tweaker, also has the drift but possesses a bigger break, deadlier skidder and a more surprising armer.
Of the two, the older and far more experienced Jadeja is the more classical red-ball run-getter. As for Axar, captains these days play him as a white-ball pinch-hitter, a role that fits his style perfectly. This doesn’t mean Jadeja, the present day trusted rear-guard, isn’t equipped to jump up the order for any urgent kamikaze operation. They seem like peas from the same pod but they aren’t. Both are incredible catchers, swift and measured movers around the field but the power and accuracy of his throws gives Jadeja the fielder, the edge.
However, they have a few common under-publicised, less-appreciated traits that do justify that ‘spin-twins’ label. They are Indian cricket’s indefatigable survivors, their careers a study in the sort of perseverance that cannot be taught.
Over the years whenever there has been a question mark over their place in the Indian side, they have bounced back to underline their relevance.
Case in point is the ongoing England series. Days before the first ODI at Nagpur, the selectors drafted in Varun Chakravarthy, the ‘variety shop of spin-bowling’. The new-age ‘six-variations per over’ wicket-taker had enjoyed great success against English batsmen in the T20 series and so the selectors and the team management wanted him around for the ODIs. After India’s Champions Trophy squad was announced there was some chatter about India lacking middle-overs wicket-takers – the 50 overs game-changers. Those in the know also say that at the selection committee meeting, there were voices that had backed Chakravarthy and didn’t whole-heartedly support the inclusion of two left-armers in the squad.
Very early in the Nagpur game, Jadeja would remind the world of his indispensability in any format of the game. It is one thing to get wickets in a T20 game when batsmen are always ready to throw caution to the wind, or even a mild breeze, and another to get Joe Root in a 50 overs game after he has been at the crease for 40 minutes. That too when the master batsman was setting the mid-overs base for an all-out assault later.
Jadeja would showcase his practised art of getting wickets when the batsman isn’t attacking. It was an armer that drove into the right-hander Root like a trunk. It hit the pads in front of the stumps. This wasn’t the case of a basher mistiming a slog but one of the game’s top batsmen being beaten while on the back foot. To pull that off, one needs someone with Jadeja’s body of work.
Axar would get Jos Butler in the 36th over – another crucial middle-over strike. There aren’t many in Indian cricket like Axar. Who except Jadeja can do an Axar – first come up with a spell of 7-0-38-1 and later turn up at No.5 to score a 52 from 47 balls after a mini-collapse.
It’s their Test match expertise that makes Axar and Jadeja the ideal middle-order batsmen in 50-overs cricket too. In the recent tour of Australia, Jadeja stood out with his batsmanship in a line-up that repeatedly succumbed to pace. Go back to the tapes, see how Jadeja, with his piercing eyes, would get into the line and at the last minute move his bat like a well-oiled sliding door giving the ball a clear passage to the ‘keeper. It was the tour when even the best in business spent over a month in search of their off-stump. With a highest of 77 his average was better than most frontline batsmen. Before that when Australia had toured India, it was Axar who played a few series-changing knocks. It was the same in the T20 World Cup that India won last year. Axar getting wickets, scoring runs and holding on to blinders.
Despite their numbers and deep understanding of every aspect of the game, Axar and Jadeja don’t shout about their achievements from rooftops nor are they angsty about being unsung. They don’t even play the social media game. Jadeja outlasted the great Ravichandran Ashwin in all formats but he never spoke about being a ‘captain without the title’. He did get a chance to lead CSK but found Dhoni’s shadow too overbearing. He would quit in the middle of 2022 season but hit a six and four on the last two balls of the final next year to win CSK the title. No righteous comments, no vague sarcastic posts, just a strong statement with the bat. Axar too has been part of the team in IPL where he was easily the MVP of the team but there were no agent-driven PR interviews to project him as a potential leader.
Back in the day, Jadeja, promoted up the order, had played a match-winning hand at No.5. Later at the press conference, he was asked if he needs to play up more often. “Number paanch toh hoon, aap chahte hain ke open karu kya? (I was playing at No.5, do you want me to open?),” he would chuckle while giving the answer. Jadeja and Axar are two cricketers who know their strengths and limitations. They don’t overreach but they don’t allow the world to undermine them.
They are the same but different. Jadeja and Axar speak the same language Gujarati but their dialects are vastly different. They hail from the same state but their cities don’t have much in common. Jadeja’s Jamnagar has palaces and a rich cricketing legacy; Axar’s Nadiad is a temple town. But what ties them is their temperament.
They are at peace with being the team’s backroom boys, but try pushing them off the stage and they come back roaring to force the spotlight on them. That way Axar is just like Jadeja.

Title: Ranji Trophy: Rematch of epic 1991 final in Haryana vs Mumbai, while J&K look to extend dream run
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-trophy-haryana-vs-mumbai-1991-final-rematch-jammu-kashmir-9823737/
Content:
The quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy get underway on Saturday with two of fixtures happening in neutral venues because of weather and logistical reasons. While Tamil Nadu take on Vidarbha in Nagpur, here is a look at the three other quarterfinals.
The contest was supposed to take place in Lahli, but the BCCI chose to shift it to Kolkata at the 11th hour as it is better prepared to handle the DRS technology. Since playing their epic final in 1991 which Haryana won by 2 runs, the two sides have faced in a knockout only once, with Mumbai winning the quarterfinals in 2009 by first innings lead. At Eden, which usually rolls out pitches that help quicks, it appears Mumbai has a definite edge because of the presence of star power and also their ability to come good in knockouts. With Suryakumar Yadav, Shivam Dube, Ajinkya Rahane all part of the side, if Mumbai can survive Haryana’s all-round attack then they can smell of another semifinal appearance. Haryana need to bring their A-game here.
Because of the extreme cold conditions in Srinagar, J&K are playing this fixture in Pune which could help Kerala in a way. J&K’s march to the quarterfinals, defeating Mumbai in their backyard en route, has been amongst the stories of the season. They have a chance to make history should they overcome Kerala. Right through this season, J&K has shown they have a team for all conditions and with a bowling unit that is on song, they should fancy their chances against Kerala which is overly reliant on their spinners, especially Jalaj Saxena and Aditya Sarwate. Having pushed the likes of Madhya Pradesh and Bengal and beaten Punjab, Kerala are not pushovers either. It is a battle of the equals.

A derby in the quarterfinals always adds to the drama and between the two, recent Ranji powerhouses Saurashtra would start as firm favourites. A qualification to knockouts looked far-fetched at the end of five rounds, but Saurashtra have bounced back with their senior players leading from the front again. In Cheteshwar Pujara and Jayden Unadkat, they have two old warhorses and but also have a new crop of players coming through as well. Gujarat, on the other hand, don’t have a star quotient but have been performing together as a unit. How well they rise up to the challenge of facing the seasoned campaigners would ultimately decide the outcome of this contest.

Title: Why the Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli combine couldn’t quite reach the Sourav Ganguly-Sachin Tendulkar heights?
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/why-rohit-sharma-virat-kohli-couldnt-reach-ganguly-tendulkar-9823691/
Content:
When India cantered through a 249-run chase to start the 2025 ODI season in Nagpur against England on Thursday, the contribution of two of their biggest active run-scorers in the format was limited to Rohit Sharma’s seven-ball two, with Virat Kohli out injured. As much as the match was about the glimpse of India’s self-sufficient 50-over machinery for the future, it was also about Rohit and Kohli—the ageing stars who bossed one-day cricket in the previous decade with progressively devastating charm.
The Rohit-Kohli combine (5280 runs) ranks fifth among the most-prolific ODI pairs and second among Indians behind Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, who top the all-time charts with an aggregate of 8227 from 176 innings. Their average of 58.66 in 95 innings is also the best among all 28 pairs to have aggregated at least 3500 runs in the format.
Yet, only a negligible proportion of this chunky accumulation has helped India’s tremendous ODI batting catalysis. Since 2020, the Rohit-Kohli partnership has added only 539 runs in 16 innings during the 42 matches they have played together, averaging 33.68. The last of their 18-century partnerships came shortly before the Covid-19 wave in January 2020, and the pair have crossed the 50-run mark only twice ever since.
5475
Perhaps the degeneration of the Rohit-Kohli unit that focussed on large blocks of accumulation – not necessarily frenetic but steady pace – was integral in thrusting India’s intent-quotient to the fullest in ODIs. As Rohit improved on his aggression up front, Kohli continued to ace the anchor-accumulator role, with both merely intersecting to effect the change.
64.06
It is bewildering how a whopping chunk of Rohit’s 1861 runs as an opener in the last five years has come while batting within the first wicket in 42 games. Rohit’s 112.65 strike rate is unmatched by any of the 11 openers who have amassed at least 1500 runs in this time. Of the 26 matches where he was the opposition’s opening wicket, Rohit has piled on 1449 runs — making 77 percent of his aggregates!
Besides Rohit’s uber-aggression not resulting in more frequent stands with Kohli, the emergence of a fluent ODI bat in Shubman Gill as his opening partner has wedged the gap of lost runs between the senior pros.
The absence of a monopolising union within the top 3 batters has enabled India’s top-7 batters to flatten their strike rates uniformly in this period.
Between January 2013 to the end of 2019, India’s top 3 (majorly comprising Rohit, Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan) amassed 59 per cent of the team runs with a 91.35 strike rate, ranking second in the world. The shares of No.s 4-7 made up 35 per cent of the total runs with an 89.93 SR dropping to fifth. That effectively pulled down the overall SR to 90.10, standing third in the period.
Since the global intent surge from 2020 onwards, India’s top 3 have piled on 10000 of the team’s 19050 runs, with No.s 4-7 adding 7831 runs. While the top 3 have soared to a 97.68 strike rate, the best in the world, the 4-7 bats have also raised their SR to 96.05 (fourth-highest), marking India’s overalls at 95.16 strike rate, second only to England’s 96.97 since 2020.
Kohli’s associations with the rotational No. 4 and 5s Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul have become more significant in accumulation in this period, more than his bulkier partnerships with Rohit and Gill at the expense of faster runs.
Given the team dynamics and the uncertainty of their co-existent future in the XI, it is unclear whether the pair that holds the record for the most ODI double-century stands (5) would embark on lengthier associations at the crease – as Tendulkar and Ganguly did even in their final year together in 2007, amassing 1192 runs at 51.82 with six 100-plus stands.

The unceremonious disintegration of Ro-Ko may have deprived fans of a glut of memorable ODI partnerships. But that has not deterred India from moving forward and forming a wholesome batting unit with more faces than their two superstars.

Title: Ranji quarterfinal: Why there is more grit to Tamil Nadu than that meets the eye
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ranji-quarterfinal-why-there-is-more-grit-to-tamil-nadu-than-that-meets-the-eye-9823614/
Content:
Tamil Nadu skipper R Sai Kishore lays bare what his team has to overcome in the next five days at Nagpur where they face Vidarbha in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals. “The real competition is with you. If you can face your own insecurities, if you can face your own mind, if you can face your own ego, I think there will be no one who can defeat you. I think that holds true for the Tamil Nadu team. If we can play to your potential, if we can face our own insecurities, there is no team that can stop us,” he says.
In many ways, this is what Tamil Nadu are up against when they cross over the ropes at the Civil Lines in Nagpur, the preferred home venue for Vidarbha. As expected Vidarbha — which pocketed more points (40) than any other team in the group stages – have rolled out a green carpet to welcome Tamil Nadu. On the eve of the match, there was thick grass cover, the conditions that Tamil Nadu encounters most often while playing away. It also tends to be a slippery slope of sorts as such pitches are mostly absent at home. Quite often, it is on those conditions that they have been found wanting, especially in knockouts, where the first day has often tended to be their biggest undoing.
Last season, in  the semifinals against Mumbai at the BKC, the story was no different. Now at the Orange City, Tamil Nadu are hoping there won’t be any hiccups. “There is an insecurity whether this team can win the Ranji Trophy. If you can cross that, that is more than enough. There is a question whether this team can do well in away games like they do at home. These are the insecurities that we have to overcome,” Sai Kishore observes.
“Until we cross over these, it is always going to exist. Two years ago this team had this insecurity as to whether we can make the knockouts. So the more you do it, it helps overcome those insecurities. As a captain I’ve seen this team overcome those insecurities, but until the world sees it, it will be there. That is what we are fighting against,” he adds.
Right from the start of the season, there was a sense of purpose in the way they went about their Ranji campaign. At times, it even felt they were prioritising the format more than anything else to bring home the trophy that has been elusive since 1988. They went on an exposure trip to the UK to give batsmen the exposure of playing on a green deck.  It was vindicated in Delhi, where inserted on a green top they nearly pulled off an innings win.
After a long while, they went about building a crop of fast bowlers including two teenagers Pranav Raghavendra and D Deepesh and the highly rated Gurjapneet Singh. Despite being ravaged by injuries – they will be without Baba Indrajith, Shahrukh Khan, Sandeep Warrier, Gurjapneet at Nagpur – they have managed to stay float unlike previous years. The timely return of B Sai Sudharsan and seamer Sonu Yadav will be an added boost to the team that lost the last league match to Jharkhand.
“To be honest, I’m fully immersed in the talent we have. Who is there, who isn’t there…there is no time for it. There is no point saying somebody isn’t here, because you are then really giving it to emotions. We have to live the moment. Whoever is here is my team. The good thing with having a young team is they don’t carry the baggage of the past and if I tell them, ‘dude, we have to win this game tomorrow’, they look at my eyes and say, ‘of course we will’. If this team is good enough, it is good enough,” he says.
Sai Kishore is also banking on the learning from last season and how they have been going about this business under L Balaji this time. Across formats, they have placed huge emphasis on taking conditions out of the equation and though it did spectacularly fail in white-ball, in red-ball they are beginning to feel at ease. All said and done, they missed a chance to play their quarterfinals at home by losing in Jamshedpur.
It is a comfort that all teams would enjoy, but Sai Kishore offers a different perspective. “If Tamil Nadu wants to win the Ranji Trophy, they have to play matches in those conditions. We can’t just take the easy route and play at home, where we have found the formula to win. If Tamil Nadu has to win, it can’t just sit behind the door saying, no, no, we will play at home. That can’t happen.  We have to take conditions out of the equation. I’ve been seeing Vidarbha players stand around the pitch and saying, ‘lets do this and that’ but not one of our players are worried about the pitch. In our mind, there is no such thing called home ground or away. Wherever you play in India, you should feel at home,” Sai Kishore adds.
We will have an answer to it in the next five days.

Title: Anil Kumble posts throwback video of iconic 10-wicket haul vs Pakistan in 1999: ‘Still can’t forget the energy at Kotla’

India legend Anil Kumble wrote his name in the history books on February 7, 1999 when he took 10 wickets in an innings to take his side to victory in a Test match against Pakistan. Now, 26 years later, the Indian offspinner posted a video on Friday (Feb 7, 2025) commemorating that feat.
“I still can’t forget the energy at Kotla that day! Sharing this special memory. It was a privilege to be a part of such a collective effort. The roar of the crowd and the support from my teammates – all contributed to this unforgettable moment. Thank you to everyone who made it so special,” Kumble posted on X with a video.
Led by captain Wasim Akram, Pakistan were on a tour to India for a 2-match Test series. The visitors had taken a 1-0 lead in the series by winning the first Test. At Feroz Shah Kotla, in the second Test, India won the toss and elected to bat first, in a must-win match.

With spinner Saqlain Mushtaq being at his ultimate best, taking a five-wicket haul, India were bowled out for 252 in the first innings. But the spin duo of Kumble and Harbhajan Singh proved too much for the visitors and they were bowled out for 172, trailing the hosts by 80 runs. Kumble took 4 wickets in the first innings. But that was not enough for him.
India scored 339 runs in the second innings, setting a target of 420 runs for Pakistan to chase. Saeed Anwar and Shahid Afridi gave Pakistan a solid start and went on to stitch a 100-run partnership for the first wicket. But Kumble turned on the heat after he came into the attack, taking two wickets in the 25th over, dismissing Afridi and Ijaz Ahmed. He later went on to take 8 more wickets, becoming only the second bowler in the history to complete a 10-wicket haul in a single innings of Test cricket, only after England’s JC Laker, who took 10 wickets for 53 runs in an innings against Australia on July 26, 1956.

On the back of Kumble’s spell of 10/74, India bowled out Pakistan for 207, winning the Test by 212 runs and levelling the series by 1-1.

Title: How J&K have debunked cliches and broken new grounds in their Ranji journey
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/how-jk-have-debunked-cliches-and-broken-new-grounds-in-their-ranji-journey-9823558/
Content:
The Jammu & Kashmir Ranji Trophy team playing Kerala in the quarterfinals at Pune’s MCA stadium, is slaying clichés, lumped on them unimaginatively all these years. ‘Fast bowlers from Kashmir Valley’, and ‘batsmen from Jammu’ was an unspoken selection quorum. But when beating star-studded Mumbai in their backyard earlier on way to topping the group ahead of knockouts, J&K coach Ajay Sharma turned such geo-labels on their head.
Elegant batters would be found in Kashmir and speed demons unearthed in Jammu.
In came, U-23 find, Yawer Hassan Khan, a delightful batsman, instructed to open in a Sam Konstas-like impact promotion. Mumbai fielders stood rooted to their spots, as he timed the ball so fluently off the back foot, driving through covers and flicking off his pads. He comes from Bijbehara in south Kashmir, mined out in a talent hunt, by widening the scouting lens that doesn’t equate his region with just workhorse pacers.
But it was Yudhvir Singh, the actual pacer from Jammu-proper, who rocked Mumbai’s core of khadoos batting, claiming Shreyas Iyer, Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal in an 11-wicket match haul. Later in a must-win against Baroda, right arm off-break Sahil Lotra, who hails from Domail in Udhampur, again Jammu, stubbed out their batting defiance, after, “Lotre ko bola gayaa aapkohi wicket lena hai,” recalls manager Hilal Ahmed. He took seven that inning to go with four from the first.
Brigadier Anil Gupta, who helms the three-member BCCI committee running the show, credits coach Sharma with reading pitches pinpoint and shuffling his team combinations and staying resolute through two years of vicious criticism. “Emphasis was on transparency and merit-based selection because we had long suffered from quotas of ‘Jammu player’ and ‘Kashmir player’ and ‘this & that player’. Now all districts are covered – Doda, Kishtwar, Poonch, Rajouri, Baramulla, Kupwara, Kulgam, Anantnag,” he reels off.
The process was set in motion in 2021, and when failures struck, selections got roasted on social media. “We stuck to our stand, carried out talent hunts, persisted with players we knew would come good. Earlier, people wouldn’t allow girls to bat on centre wickets. We said, nothing doing, our girls will get every matching facility,” Brig. Gupta says.
Players emerged from unconventional areas – coal town Kalakote (Abdul Samad), Baramulla (Auqib Nabi), Bhaderwah (Abid Mushtaq), even as top run-getter Shubham Khajuria and newest ‘Mr Wall’ Kanhaiya Wadhwan (71 &84 vs Baroda) continue the Jammu tradition. Auqib was so audacious on his debut that when told he was a night watchman against Punjab, he slammed a century to prove a point.
J&K have beaten Mumbai before, besides making knockouts twice – 2001-2 and 2013-14. But self-assurance gleams through when Umar Nazir Mir, their Pulwama pacer, doesn’t celebrate Rohit Sharma’s wicket. Still, when a youngster asked what sort of team the other heavyweight Baroda was, “Mumbai jaisi team hai koi” came the quip.
Foundational work was put in by two old warhorses, steeped in game-craft, attempting to get J&K to the first semis – coach Sharma and administration executor, Mithun Manhas. They kept a close eye on Himachal-born Paras Dogra, a 40-year-old playing for Pondicherry. Brig. Gupta recalls, “There was a lot of internal bickering. So the dressing room atmosphere wasn’t great. We needed a captain to pull them all in one direction. We observed Paras for two years, because he’s a good brain, and then brought him in to lead.”
The team overheard smug shrugs of “such a big team like Mumbai won’t fail twice.” It invigorated the underdogs to trigger two memorable collapses.
But quiet, sweaty preparations prepared them for the rigour. “To ensure the hot temperatures and breaking pitches didn’t melt us, we played Chennai’s Buchi Babu tournament, twice and against state teams of Himachal, Chandigarh and Punjab,” Brig. Gupta recalls.
Four-day matches were played locally. The natural black soil wickets back home were relaid with red soil of south and west India. “So it wasn’t a handicap for us.” Seven turf wickets and as many central wickets were laid out in Katra, even as JKCA started supplying Kookaburra and SG Test grade balls, used in actual tournaments, were shipped in.
Older players like Shubham Khajuria and Samad, who continued cricket like it were a ‘gentleman’s game’ were convinced they were the backbones of the team and Ajay Sharma and his senior lieutenants would look at the wicket within hours of landing in Pune.
U-23 find Yawer was given confidence to open, and wicketkeeper Kanhaiya Wadhwan freedom to bat cheeky or serious. “They are both quiet and focused on winning. Plus, their fielding, one of India’s best,” manager Ahmed said.
J&K spends considerable time on shuttle sprints, timed at 4.09 seconds. And a pair of Rajasthan stalwarts bowler, P Krishna and fielding coach Dishant Yagnik have propped up acrobatic standards. Most coaches came in, via applications after ads were placed. And despite the absence of star pacer Umran Malik, unheard-of districts are throwing up names stepping up to the task, with Yudhvir being the latest after returning from Hyderabad.
For a young generation that’s only watched Virat Kohli rise to superstardom as a batter (Nasir Lone is even called ‘Nasir Kohli’ due to his mannerisms), the idea of sturdy batting, daddy centuries in domestic, was drilled in, through an airport incident. Manager Ahmed narrates: “We ran into L Balaji at the airport, and he greeted Ajay Sharma as ‘Father of Centuries’, because of his huge runs and average of 68.” Murmurs went around of ‘kya bola?’ Eyebrows went up when numbers were dug up. “Suddenly, 30-40 runs weren’t enough. Everyone wants centuries now.”

Title: R Ashwin says media does not ‘appreciate’ Ravindra Jadeja and he is ‘more gifted’ cricketer than off-spinner himself

Content:
On Thursday during the first ODI between India and England Ravindra Jadeja has scalped three wickets. The English batters were squezzed by the left-armer. His spell effectively changed the momentum of the innings, and it is not the only time Jadeja delivers a performance which derails the oppostion innings.
Jadeja has made it a habit of being efficent in the middle overs of a 50-over game regardless of wickets helping him or not. Former Indian off-spinner would go on to say the media does not “appreciate” Jadeja and he is also “more gifted” cricketer than Ashwin himself.
“Our media fails to appreciate when a player does well. Whenever we lose, everyone becomes a villain. He dismissed Joe Root (in the 1st IND vs ENG ODI). Jadeja goes always under the radar. He is a “Jackpot Jango”. He is +10 in the field, also bowls well and bats in pressure situations as well. We don’t give Jadeja enough credit,” he said on his YouTube channel in the show Ash Ki baat.
Ashwin (765 wickets) is the second highest wicket-tacker for India behind Anil Kumble (953 wickets). In the show co-host Vimal Kumar when asks about Jadeja getting closer to Ashwin himself he would respond by: “Jadeja is way more gifted than I ever can. He is a born athlete. His major advantages lie in his physical fitness. He is naturally fit. Even at this age, he can cover the entire area from long on to deep square leg while standing at mid-wicket. I wouldn’t be surprised. And I will be more than happy for him.”
Jadeja is currently on 600 international wickets fifth in the all time list for India behind Kapil Dev (707 wickets) and Harbhajan Singh (697 wickets).
In addition to his bowling, Jadeja has also been quite an effective lower order bat both in white-ball cricket and red-ball cricket. Though the performances in the shorter-format have taken a dip in recent times but in longer format of the game Jadeja has become increasingly relaible for the last few years and has been among the best batters both home and way while the top-order batters have struggled for runs.

Title: IPL is the leader in franchise cricket…we can only learn from them: Graeme Smith

SA20 commissioner Graeme Smith has lauded the IPL and said SA20 and other franchise leagues can only learn from the IPL. The former South African skipper also thanked IPL for their support.
“BCCI and IPL have been amazing in supporting us and guiding us in every decision we have made. IPL is the leader in franchise cricket by far, and we can only learn from them,” he said to PTI.
“A lot of hard work went in the beginning to getting the structures right, to getting the business model right as well. It was about trying to attract the right type of partners. We were very fortunate at the time that some of the most experienced franchises in world cricket, the best, the most competitive, are the IPL franchises,” Smith said before the tournament.
“They attract the best players. For me, one of the standouts is being in that first week of cricket and standing in each stadium behind inand seeing how the fans are dressed in the colours of the franchises and how much they’re behind their teams. And that’s been brilliant,” he added.
Smith also spoke about how happy he was to have Dinesh Karthik playing in the league. The veteran who is not a contracted Indian player and also has retired from IPL is playing for Paarl Royals in the tournament.
“We always said that we have worked with the BCCI to see what their views are for the future. South African cricket loves Indian cricketers. It is always a highlight for us to watch the talent of the Indian team whenever they come here to play,” said Smith.
“If the Indian players were available, we would love to have them here. But nothing of that sort is in the pipeline. We always have conversations and probably at the IPL time I will be there in India. We have a very good relationship with them.
“A lot of hard work went in the beginning to getting the structures right, to getting the business model right as well. It was about trying to attract the right type of partners.

Title: Pakistan officially rule out injured opener Saim Ayub from Champions Trophy
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-officially-rules-out-saim-ayub-from-champions-trophy-9823307/
Content:
The Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday officially ruled out opener Saim Ayub from the Champions Trophy, a decision which was an open secret since his name was not in Pakistan’s announced squad for the tournament. A few weeks back, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi had also ruled out Ayub’s availability, saying they are not going to risk the player’s future for the Champions Trophy.
“Pakistan opener Saim Ayub is progressing well in his recovery from a right ankle fracture and will continue his rehabilitation in England. Following comprehensive MRI scans, X-rays, and medical assessments, Saim has been ruled out for 10 weeks from the date of injury (3 January). His availability for the New Zealand tour will be subject to clearing all fitness tests and medical requirements,” a statement from PCB read.
Pakistan will tour New Zealand for five T20Is and three ODIs from March 16 to April 5, which will be followed by the Pakistan Super League starting on April 8.

Title: ‘I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which led to a weight loss of 10 kg,’: Fakhar Zaman on being dropped from Pakistan squad
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-was-diagnosed-with-hyperthyroidism-which-led-to-a-weight-loss-of-10-kg-fakhar-zaman-on-being-dropped-from-pakistan-squad-9823176/
Content:
Attacking opener Fakhar Zaman has been axed from the Pakistan side after having a poor 2024 T20 World Cup. However, he has been brought into the side for the upcoming Champions Trophy 2025. Before getting dropped from the squad Fakhar would also criticize Pakistan Cricket Board for dropping Babar Azam from the side during a Test series against England.
While there have been speculations if that was also part of the reason behind his getting dropped Zaman would clear the air and say he was diagnosed with a health condition. “Anyone can fall sick. I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which led to a weight loss of 10 kg and weakened my muscles. This was the only reason I was out of the team—there was nothing else. I am fully fit now, but the first four to five matches in domestic cricket were tough, and I felt as if I had forgotten how to play,” Zaman said on podcast with Salman Butt.
In the last edition of Champions Trophy in 2017 Fakhar played a crucial role in Pakistan’s win. He scored a squash-buckling ton in the final to help Men In Green lift the trophy. “I will try my best to make this Champions Trophy even more memorable for myself and the team. I believe he will perform well as an opener and make things easier for me.”
While Zaman can win games on his day he can also be inconsistent at times which has frustrated the Pakistan supporters. “The big problem is Fakhar Zaman. He is an unorthodox hitter, but when someone like that gets out of form, it takes some time to find solutions on the drawing board. He’s a bottom-handed player, plays on the leg-side, somehow he adjusts with that and scores,” Former Pakistan cricketer Ramiz Raja said on his YouTube channel once on his technique.

    Title: ‘I’ve been a little bit surprised’: Ricky Ponting on Shreyas Iyer’s initial non-inclusion in India’s playing XI vs England in 1st ODI
    URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ricky-ponting-surprised-shreyas-iyer-non-inclusion-ind-vs-eng-odi-9823178/
    Content:
    With Shreyas Iyer revealing on Thursday that he only got into the Indian Playing XI against England at Nagpur due to Virat Kohli getting injured, former Australia skipper and Iyer’s Punjab Kings coach Ricky Ponting said he was surprised by the Indian think tank’s decision of not including the middle order batter. Iyer has been one of the best ODI players for India, playing a vital role in the Men in Blue’s run to the final of the 2023 World Cup, scoring 530 runs.
    “I’ve been a little bit surprised that he’s been out of India’s side in the last couple of years. He had a terrific World Cup back in India (2023) where he played beautifully in the middle-order and I actually felt then that he’d almost cemented that spot and made that his own,” opined Ponting on ICC Review.
    “Then he had those couple of injuries, obviously injured his back and went out of the side, but his domestic season this year has been brilliant. It sort of coincided with what he’s done since around (IPL) auction time going forward in domestic cricket, he has been pretty much outstanding,” said Ponting about the right-hand batter, who guided Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title last year after missing the 2023 edition due to a serious back injury.
    Iyer steadied India’s innings at Nagpur after the hosts had lost both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma early and scored a 36-ball 59. This was an extension of his good form this season with the Mumbai batter also scoring two centuries in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.
    Ponting said that Iyer will thrive in the Champions Trophy where India play all their matches in Dubai.
    “He’s got the game that will stand up to the white-ball formats, especially in that part of the world,” Ponting said.

    “On those wickets — the slower, lower wickets — he’s dynamic on those. We know how good a hitter of spin bowling he is and teams tend not to bowl a lot of spin at India, but at some stage it’s going to come,” he added.

    Title: Sreesanth issued show cause notice by KCA for ‘false and defamatory’ statements over Sanju Samson omission
    URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/sreesanth-issued-show-cause-notice-by-kca-for-false-and-defamatory-statements-over-sanju-samson-omission-9823204/
    Content:
    The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) has issued a show cause notice to former India cricketer S Sreesanth for making “false and defamatory” statements against the association in a television show. Sreesanth had questioned KCA on their decision to overlook Sanju Samson from the domestic white-ball season for Kerala. Samson was reportedly omitted from India’s ICC Champions Trophy 2025 squad for not playing the Vijay Hazare tournament.
    KCA said its show cause notice was not for Sreesanth showing support to Samson, but for “making false and defamatory statements” which, KCA said, was a violation of his contractual terms as the co-owner of the Kollam Sailors franchise in the Kerala Cricket League.
    In its response to Sreesanth’s comments, KCA brought up the infamous spot-fixing case against Sreesanth to say that it always supported players, even if they were in jail, which was a dig at the former India pacer.
    “When Sreesanth was in jail facing allegations in the infamous match-fixing scandal, KCA officials visited and supported him. Although the court quashed the criminal case, it is a fact that he has not been acquitted in the match-fixing case. In such a situation, there is no need for Sreesanth to take up the protection of other players,” the statement read.
    In 2013, Delhi Police had arrested Sreesanth on charges of spot-fixing. Sreesanth was one of three Rajasthan Royals players to be banned from cricket for his involvement in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. In July 2015, the Patiala House court dropped all charges against Sreesanth, Chandila, and Chavan in the spot-fixing case, saying there was no prima facie case under MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) to be made out against them. Then, in March 2019, the Supreme Court lifted the lifetime ban on him.
    “It was only because of KCA’s protective approach that Sreesanth was given opportunities in matches including the Ranji Trophy after completing his sentence. It is worth investigating whether other associations have taken such a favorable approach towards players involved in match-fixing,” it further quoted.
    Sreesanth had asked which international player KCA had managed to produce after Samson. At this, KCA slammed Sreesanth’s “ignorance about Kerala cricket” before listing out names of players: “Sajna Sajeevan, Minnumani, Asha Shobana, and junior players like Joshitha V.J. in the Under-19 World Cup winning team, Najla CMC in the Under-19 team, and Mohammed Inan in the Under-19 Asia Cup team.”
    However, Sreesanth did not back down after the show cause notice, instead lambasting KCA in an interview with Kerala media outlet Onmanorama where he questioned why KCA has been overlooking Malayalis and getting players from the other associations. “They (KCA) take players from other states to play for us. For what? Disrespectful to our Malayali cricketers,” he said.
    “We have just one player at international level, Sanju. Let’s all support him,” Sreesanth said. “The so-called KCA has not produced an international cricketer since Sanju. We have great players like Sachin, Nidheesh, Vishnu Vinod, and many others, but are they (KCA) pushing them to play at higher?” he questioned.
    Earlier, explaining why Samson was ignored, KCA secretary Vinod S Kumar told The Indian Express: “Sanju had sent an email stating that he would not be available for the camp. The team had a short camp in Wayanad without him. Naturally, we only considered those who were part of the sessions for selection. There has been no further discussion with him on the matter.”

    Title: Shreyas Iyer wasn’t likely to play if Kohli was fit…first Indian to score 500+ runs batting at 4: Aakash Chopra slams selection thought process
    URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shreyas-iyer-wasnt-likely-to-play-if-kohli-was-fit-first-indian-to-score-500-runs-batting-at-4-aakash-chopra-slams-selection-though-process-9822732/
    Content:
    India was 19-2 when Shreyas Iyer walked to the crease on Thursday. The likes of Jofra Archer and Saqib Mahmood were bowling thunderbolts to the batters under lights defending 249 runs. However, Iyer was up to the challenge as he came up with a sublime counter-attacking innings of 36-ball 59 which changed the momentum of the game.
    After the game, Iyer would reveal that he was not supposed to play the game and it was only because Virat Kohli had an injury the night before. “As you all know I wasn’t supposed to play today. Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. I kept myself prepared. I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play. The same thing happened with me last year as well during the Asia Cup. I got injured and someone else came in and scored a century,” Iyer said.
    However, former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra was unhappy about the thought process of dropping Iyer from the team. “Trying to wrap my head around the revelation that Iyer wasn’t likely to play if Kohli was fit. He’s the first Indian to score 500+ runs batting at 4 in a World Cup. 2023. How could you bench him?? And if he wasn’t going to play, where was Kohli supposed to bat? At 4? Surely, Gill wasn’t getting pushed to 4,” he tweeted on X.
    “I got a call from the skipper (Rohit Sharma) saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee,” Iyer would reveal. “I went back to my room and went off to sleep straight away.” Thursday’s revelation revealed India are now thinking of changing tack. If Jaiswal is a regular and Shubman Gill takes the No.3 position, it will have Virat Kohli at No.4. The left-handed Axar is likely to bat next with Rahul or Pandya next, depending on the state of the game.

    Title: ‘Harshit Rana was the most expensive Indian bowler…but he got three crucial wickets’: Sanjay Manjrekar lauds debutant

    Content:
    Harshit Rana made his debut in the first ODI between India and England in Nagpur on Thursday. The pacer was put to the sword in his opening spell when Phil Salt extracted 26 runs of Rana’s third over. At this point, the 23-year-old was looking out of his depth. However, Rana would later pick the likes of Ben Duckett, Harry Brook, and Liam Livingstone to break the spine of England’s middle order.
    Though Rana conceded 53 runs from his seven overs at 7.60, his spell turned the first innings in India’s favor. “It’s never really about economy. Harshit Rana was the most expensive Indian bowler, but he got three crucial wickets and in many ways, sealed the game for India to win at the halfway stage,” Sanjay Manjrekar wrote on his X account. (Formerly known as Twitter).
    Thanks to Rana and Ravindra Jadeja’s three-wicket hauls England at one point 75/0 looked like posting a massive total, were bundled out for 248 runs. “I didn’t hit the right lengths initially but got the rewards once I corrected them. They were looking to make some room (the batters), that’s the reason I kept bowling on the stumps,” Rana said about his change of strategy during the match. It’s a slightly two-paced pitch. Some of them are coming on nicely, some are stopping a bit. We bounced back in style. It’s a good total and we can chase this down,” he added.
    While Duckett and Livingstone got out to short-pitch deliveries Brook was caught down the leg-side of a delivery which was around the rib-cage area. Rana would reveal that the dismissal of Brook was planned. “You can say that it was planned. Earlier, I wanted to set it up by bowling a short delivery. I was able to bowl a good short delivery and got the reward,” he said in the post-match press conference.

    England will play their Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan later this month, England’s cricket board (ECB) said on Thursday, despite calls to boycott the game in response to the Taliban government’s crackdown on women’s rights.
    Last month, a group of British lawmakers urged England to boycott the Champions Trophy group stage match against Afghanistan which will be held in Lahore on February 26.
    South Africa Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie also supported calls for a boycott.
    Afghanistan had 25 contracted women players in 2020, but most are now living in exile in Australia following the Taliban takeover of their country in August 2021.
    However, ECB chair Richard Thompson said they would play the match after discussions with the government, the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the players, adding that the cricketing community alone cannot tackle Afghanistan’s problems.
    “We remain of the view that a co-ordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match,” Thompson said in a statement.
    “We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans, watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.”
    The Taliban say they respect women’s rights in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic law and local customs and that they are internal matters that should be addressed locally.
    Last week, Afghanistan’s exiled women cricketers were named the first beneficiaries of a new refugee fund started by the Marylebone Cricket Club and Thompson said the ECB had donated 100,000 pounds ($124,350).
    “We will continue to press the ICC to take further action, including ringfencing a meaningful portion of funding to support female players from Afghanistan to be able to access cricket,” he added.
    Thompson also said the ICC should consider recognising an Afghanistan women’s refugee team while also supporting and developing displaced Afghan women “to thrive in non-playing roles” such as coaches and administrators.

    “What is happening in Afghanistan is nothing short of gender apartheid,” he said.
    “At a cricketing level, when women’s and girls’ cricket is growing rapidly around the world, it is heartbreaking that those growing up in Afghanistan are denied this opportunity.”

    Title: Shreyas Iyer says he wasn’t supposed to play 1st ODI, was only added to XI after Virat Kohli’s pull out

    Content:
    When Virat Kohli pulled out of the first ODI against England due to a sore knee in the morning of the game, it was thought Yashasvi Jaiswal was the one who replaced him. But Shreyas Iyer revealed at the end of the game that he wouldn’t have played the game had Kohli been fit.
    The surprise move reveals India’s mood ahead of the Champions Trophy and in particular the head coach Gautam Gambhir’s preference to have left-right combination in the batting line-up.
    “As you all know I wasn’t supposed to play today. Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. I kept myself prepared. I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play. The same thing happened with me last year as well during the Asia Cup. I got injured and someone else came in and scored a century,” Iyer said.
    The talking point before this ODI series didn’t revolve around Iyer as he was expected to be part of the middle order with his adventurous stroke play. India don’t play Rishabh Pant in the ODIs, preferring KL Rahul with the wicketkeeping gloves, and that leaves Hardik Pandya as the main attacking batsman lower down the order. Here is where Iyer’s aggressive batting was supposed to help the Indian with another aggressive counter-attacking option.
    But Thursday’s revelation revealed India are now thinking of changing tack. If Jaiswal is a regular and Shubman Gill takes the No.3 position, it will have Virat Kohli at No.4. The left-handed Axar is likely to bat next with Rahul or Pandya next, depending on the state of the game.
    After Iyer’s dazzling fifty that switched the pressure back on England, it remains to be seen now what combination India will play in the second ODI.
    Iyer revealed that he was watching a movie last night and thought he could extend his night but then he got a call.
    “I got a call from the skipper (Rohit Sharma) saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee. I went back to my room and went off to sleep straight away,” Iyer laughed.
    At this, the commentator Parthiv Patel said, “We didn’t know that actually! We thought that Yashasvi Jaiswal played because Virat got injured. We were sure that you were going to find a place in the XI.”
    Iyer replied: “What do you want me to say? I am just going to keep it lowkey and cherish the moment and the victory.”

    Title: India vs England: Rohit Sharma fails again, but Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel steer India home
    URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-rohit-sharma-fails-shubman-gill-axar-shreyas-9821652/
    Content:
    Rohit Sharma failed, but the performance of Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, and Axar Patel stood out as India proved too strong for England to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series in Nagpur. The batting effort came on the back of a splendid bowling performance that restricted England to 248 after they were 71 for 0 in 8 overs at one stage.
    It was an all-round performance from India across all three departments. India were without Virat Kohli, who missed the game due to a knee injury he suffered on the eve of the match, and captain Rohit fell for two runs. But fifties from Shubman Gill (87), Shreyas Iyer (59), and Axar Patel (52) eased them past the target in 38.4 overs.
    Gill recently admitted to losing concentration in the red-ball format. Most of his dismissals in Australia were a sort of “brain fade.” But in the ODI format, where he was India’s best batter leading up to the 2023 ODI World Cup before dengue forced him to miss a couple of matches, he looked at ease. There was no lapse of concentration as he almost took India home.
    Under the lights, India were in a spot of bother after they lost debutant Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma quickly. Shubman, who was batting at No. 3 in the absence of Virat Kohli, first forged a 94-run stand with Shreyas Iyer and then took India closer to the total with a crucial 108-run stand with Axar Patel.
    Gill’s innings on Thursday was a two-part knock. In the first half, he was required to play the second fiddle to Shreyas Iyer, who was at his marauding best before he took charge. Gill picked Archer’s slower delivery and whacked it through square leg. In the same over, Jofra cranked up 145 kph, and Shubman’s bread-and-butter flat-batted pull shot was out. Later in the 27th over, there was another brace of fours off Archer, and the second one in particular captured his poise and skill. He had to wait for the ball on the slightly two-paced pitch and unfurled a lovely late steer past backward point.
    The only false shot Shubman played cost him his wicket. On 87, and in search for some quick runs to finish the innings, he backed away outside leg but was cramped for room and mistimed his short-arm jab pull. The ball hit his bat twice, and lobbed towards mid-on where Jos Buttler took a good catch.
    A couple of weeks ago at the Indian Express’ Idea Exchange, Shreyas Iyer mentioned that he had unfinished business with ODI cricket. On Thursday in Nagpur, he walked the talk. The right-handed batter blasted 59 runs off 36 balls.
    Shreyas Iyer walked into a semi-crisis as India were 19 for 2. Jofra Archer was bowling close to 150 kph, and it looked like England might give India a scare. They had a short-leg in place to test him on the short ball in the 7th over. Off his 7th ball, he pulled a back-of-length delivery from Archer over midwicket boundary. Archer bent his back for the next ball and got it to climb higher but gave some width outside off and Iyer’s slash had the ball fly over third man. From that point on, he kept whacking the ball all around the park.
    There was a nonchalance in the way he batted in this inning. He cut, he pulled, he swivelled, he drove, he swept, he reverse swept, he showed his deft touch, ran hard between the wickets, and with this knock settled the debate about his importance in India’s ODI side.
    The best of the onslaught was saved for Brydon Carse. He hit three boundaries off the England pacer in the 10th over of India’s innings. The third ball was placed past backward point, then he played a lovely square drive and ended the over with an exquisite cover drive.
    There was a reverse slap against Adil Rashid and a paddle sweep off Jacob Bethell, which helped him bring up his fifty in 31 balls. His knock ended while he tried to paddle Bethell again and was pinned. But the Indian management will consider another box ticked with Iyer getting back into his groove.
    Axar was promoted ahead of Rahul and as ever, he played the situation perfectly, using his long reach to belt the ball and also rotated the strike adroitly.
    England were off to a pulsating start, reaching 75 without loss, and looked set to post a formidable total.
    India bowled and fielded well, and captain Rohit Sharma’s captaincy was also top-notch, but like in the T20Is, England proved to be their own worst enemies.
    On the eve of the match, England captain Jos Buttler, who top-scored with a fine 52, had rued his side’s inability to execute their plans according to the match situation. He had said, “You want to be aggressive, you want to be conservative, you want to be measured, you’ve still got to go out there and execute it and play it well.”
    England were certainly aggressive, and with Buttler and youngster Jacob Bethell (51), they were conservative as well, but they were far from being measured.
    The wickets of Salt and Duckett were sheer brilliance from Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal, but it was reckless from both openers. Iyer ran back from point to make a sliding stop near the boundary and that dive made Duckett freeze at non-striker’s end and Salt had to abort his plan for the third run and try getting back but was too late. Duckett was caught by a tumbling Jaiswal running back from midwicket and lunging. Root was pinned by Jadeja with a zipping armer, and Brook was hurried by Rana’s bouncer.
    England captain Jos Buttler couldn’t believe what he had done to Axar Patel’s half-tracker. The ball, which deserved to be put in the stands, was top-edged by Buttler to short fine leg, where Hardik Pandya took an easy catch.
    Livingstone ducked under a Rana bouncer and charged down a couple of balls later but could only edge the wild swing off the bouncer to the wicketkeeper. Brydon Carse, who had rescued England multiple times in the T20Is, tried to slug Shami out of the park but had his stumps rattled.

    Brendon McCullum’s Bazballers have found it tough in India. They were hammered 4-1 in the Test series last year. His era in white-ball cricket started with another 4-1 loss in the T20I series, and his pursuit of the Champions Trophy has also started on a low note.

    India internationals and former U19 World Cup winning players lined up to welcome Niki Prasad, the 19-year-old who led her side to the title at the recent tournament in Malaysia. India were crowned ICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup 2025 champions for the second time in two editions, with a nine-wicket win over South Africa.
    Shafali Verma, who was the captain of the first ICC Women’s U19 World Cup winning side, was among the DC players who welcomed Niki. The youngster was picked up at the recent auction for Women’s Premier League for 10 lakh. Titas Sadhu, who was the player of the match in the final couple of years back, also lined up to get an autograph.

    Before the tournament too, Shafali had told Niki that she wished her the best for India to retain the title won at the inaugural edition under the former’s leadership in South Africa.

    “Coming into the tournament, I said we are here to dominate and make sure India stays on top,” Niki had said after the World Cup triumph. “We are going to create a legacy of winning this tournament and other ICC tournaments for India. “I am feeling really happy that I am right here standing as a world champion and helping India to stay on top. It is a special moment, playing in this World Cup and doing this for India.”

    Title: Return of Mohammed Shami and Kuldeep Yadav: A sigh of relief for India ahead of the Champions Trophy
    URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/mohammed-shami-kuldeep-yadav-return-india-champions-trophy-9821282/
    Content:
    Mohammed Shami and Kuldeep Yadav weren’t even the Indians bowlers with most wickets in the first ODI, but they showed enough rhythm and signs that they are back and are likely to get better with every game. Shami especially was on song from the start. On a slightly two-faced pitch at Nagpur, the Indian bowling unit showed a glimpse of their 2023 ODI World Cup winning run, where they won 10 games in a row before losing the final against Australia.
    Returning from their long injury layoffs, Shami and Kuldeep picked up a wicket apiece as an all-round bowling performance restricted England to 248. Considering England were 71without loss in 8 overs, it was an admirable comeback from the Indians.  For India, Ravindra Jadeja (3/26) and Harshit Rana (3/53) were the pick of the bowlers.
    It started with misunderstanding between the openers Phil Salt and Ben Duckett. Salt was run out looking for a third run and at one point, he and Duckett were basically at the same end. Even here there was an Indian hand; Shreyas Iyer had charged back from square-leg, put in a sliding stop near the boundary that caused Duckett to stay rooted at the non-striker’s end.

    The big question of the day, though,  was who would the void left by Jasprit Bumrah. When Salt smashed debutant Harshit Rana for 26 runs in an over, it looked like England would easily score 320-330, but the run out opened the doors for the Indians. After Iyer, it was Yashasvi Jaiswal’s stunner that stole the thunder. Jaiswal’s catch of Ben Duckett was as good as Travis Head’s to take out Rohit Sharma in the ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad. Jaiswal backpedalled from midwicket, made a good 15m dash, judged the flight and dip of the ball, and lunged forward at full stretch to grab the ball.
    Having got the whiff, the Indian bowlers tightened the noose even without their spearhead. Shami looked on song from the first ball that curved away a touch. The first over he bowled was a maiden. Apart from movement, he also extracted bounce as the ball whistled past the outside edge of Phil Salt, rushing past the bat’s splice.
    In his second over, Ben Duckett greeted him with a fine drive to the straight boundary, but Shami pulled his length back to bowl four dots to end the over. Shami could have had his first wicket, that of Duckett, in his third over, but Hardik Pandya, standing at mid-on, misjudged a catch as he was five paces inside the 30-yard line. His full-stretch jump was not enough as the ball touched his fingernails and went for a boundary. A good over had ended with two boundaries but in those first three overs, Shami sent a gentle reminder to the world that he is back.
    After troubling youngster Jacob Bethell with a sharp bouncer, Shami had his wicket in the seventh over, a first in ODIs after 15 months, when he castled the stumps of Brydon Carse who was trying to hit it out of the park.
    Kuldeep Yadav, England’s tormentor in last year’s Test series, was also making his comeback after three months following a groin injury. There was guile in his bowling; he looked deceptive as he grew into his spell. Initially, Joe Root, with his reverse sweep, tried to disturb his length, but with his stock balls that turn into the right-handers, he managed to keep Root and Jos Buttler quiet.

    Kuldeep did give away a few freebies, like the one in the 22nd over to Jos Buttler. He floated one too wide outside the off stump and Buttler punished him. In the next ball, he dragged his length back and Buttler caressed it past backward square leg.
    Kuldeep finally had his wicket in his last over, which was also England’s last wicket, as England No. 10 Saqib Mahmood tried to give him a charge and was stranded metres away from the crease.

    In Bumrah’s absence, India’s wicket-takers Shami and Kuldeep looked in good rhythm, which must have given the Indian camp a big relief.

    Title: Rohit Sharma’s rough patch continues, gets dismissed for 2 runs vs England in 1st ODI

    India captain Rohit Sharma’s rough patch of form continued as he was dismissed for just 2 runs in the 1st ODI against England at Nagpur on Thursday with the home team reeling at 19/2 after also losing Yashasvi Jaiswal.
    Rohit, who lasted just 7 deliveries, went early for a flick shot off Saqib Mahmood but only got the toe-end of the bat which led to the ball going high and landing safely in the palms of Liam Livingstone at mid-on.
    The latest dismissal compounded to the Indian skipper’s problems as he now has just 166 runs in the last 16 innings across all formats.

    On Wednesday, Rohit didn’t seem too pleased with questions on his current form and his future after the ICC Champions Trophy in the press conference on the eve of the first ODI against England in Nagpur.
    When asked about his lack of runs over the last several months and the return to his favourite format, the Indian captain lost his composure.
    “What kind of a question is that? This is a different format, a different time. As usual, as cricketers, we know there will be ups and downs and I have faced a lot in my career, so this is nothing new to me. We know every day is a fresh day, every series is a fresh series,” Rohit had shot back.
    “I am looking forward to the challenge, not looking at what has happened in the past. Clearly you don’t, so obviously for me also there is no reason to look back too much. A lot of good things have happened as well. It’s important that I focus on what is coming up and what lies ahead for me. It is as simple as that. Look to try and start the series on a high,” he had added.
    In the match, debutant pacer Harshit Rana (3/53) and seasoned left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja (3/26) shared six wickets between them as India bowled out England for a modest 248. Pacer Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel bagged a wicket apiece.
    England got off to a flier, reaching 71 for no loss in only eight overs, but India fought back with regular wickets to not allow the visitors run away with momentum.

    While Phil Salt (43) and Ben Duckett (32) gave England a solid start, skipper Jos Buttler (52) and Jacob Bethell (51) hit fifties.
